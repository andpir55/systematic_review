Title = {{Incentivizing Responses to Self-report Questions in Perceptual
   Deterrence Studies: An Investigation of the Validity of Deterrence
   Theory Using Bayesian Truth Serum}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Criminological researchers want people to reveal considerable private
   information when utilizing self-report surveys, such as involvement in
   crime, subjective attitudes and expectations, and probability judgments.
   Some of this private information is easily accessible for subjects and
   all that is required is for individuals to be honest, while other
   information requires mental effort and cognitive reflection. Though
   researchers generally provide little or no incentive to be honest and
   thoughtful, it is generally assumed that subjects do provide honest and
   accurate information. We assess the accuracy of deterrence measures by
   employing a scoring rule known as the Bayesian truth serum (BTS)-that
   incentivizes honesty and thoughtfulness among respondents.
   Individuals are asked to report on self-report offending and estimates
   of risk after being assigned to one of two conditions: (1) a group where
   there is a financial incentive just for participation, and (2) a BTS
   financial incentive group where individuals are incentivized to be
   honest and thoughtful.
   We find evidence that there are some important differences in the
   responses to self-reporting offending items and estimates of the
   probability of getting arrested between the groups. Individuals in the
   BTS condition report a greater willingness to offend and lower estimates
   of perceived risk for drinking and driving and cheating on exams.
   Moreover, we find that the negative correlation between perceived risk
   and willingness to offend that is often observed in scenario-based
   deterrence research does not emerge in conditions where respondents are
   incentivized to be accurate and thoughtful in their survey responses.
   The results raise some questions about the accuracy of survey responses
   in perceptual deterrence studies, and challenge the statistical
   relationship between perceived risk and offending behavior. We suggest
   further exploration within criminology of both BTS and other scoring
   rules and greater scrutiny of the validity of criminological data.}},

Title = {{The doctor-patient relationship, defensive medicine and overprescription
   in Chinese public hospitals: Evidence from a cross-sectional survey in
   Shenzhen city}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL SCIENCE \& MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{123}},

Abstract = {{Defensive medicine describes physicians' behavioral response to threats
   from medical malpractice litigation. Previous studies have found
   widespread practice of defensive medicine that is responsible for the
   global escalation of health care costs. Defying the traditional
   explanations, this study, with a case of a Chinese city, reveals that in
   a country where medical malpractice lawsuits are rare, physicians'
   self-perceived threats from patients may constitute a major reason for
   defensive practices. Defensive behaviors in the Chinese context mainly
   take the form of overprescribing diagnostic tests, procedures and drugs.
   The existing literature tends to explain this in terms of Chinese
   doctors' desire to supplement their low incomes. Behind this is a series
   of misaligned incentives deeply embedded in the Chinese health system.
   Using a cross-sectional survey of physicians, this study shows that
   overprescription in Chinese hospitals is driven not only by hard
   economic incentives, but also by doctors' motive of avoiding disputes
   with patients. The survey was carried out in Shenzhen City, in December
   2013. A sample containing 504 licensed physicians was drawn by random
   sampling. Descriptive analyses identified significant dissatisfaction
   with income and workload as well as severe tensions between doctors and
   patients. Drawing from the literature on defensive medicine,
   multivariate analysis revealed that physicians' previous experience of
   medical disputes is significantly associated with defensive behaviors,
   particularly overprescription. Low income continued to be a critical
   predictor, reinforcing the target income hypothesis and suggesting the
   resilience of perverse economic incentives. This study sheds fresh light
   on China's recent health policy reforms by highlighting the critical
   impact of the doctor patient relationship. The effort to contain health
   care costs must progress on two fronts, mitigating the tensions between
   doctors and patients while still reforming the remuneration scheme
   cautiously to enable physicians to respond to right incentives. (C) 2014

Title = {{Trending Health Information Technology Adoption Among New York Nursing
   Homes}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MANAGED CARE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{ESP53+}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objectives
   Federal policies are incentivizing hospitals and providers to adopt and
   meaningfully use electronic health records (EHRs). Nursing homes are not
   eligible for incentives. However, understanding health information
   technology (HIT) adoption among nursing homes will be critical to
   developing HIT policies for this sector. Our objective was to assess the
   pace of EHR adoption, changes in computerized function adoption, and
   participation in health information exchange by New York state nursing
   homes over time.
   Study Design
   We used a repeated, cross-sectional study design.
   Methods
   We surveyed all New York state nursing homes between February and May
   2013, comparing results to the same survey administered in 2012. Results
   We received responses from 472 of 630 nursing homes (74.9\%). Rates of
   EHR adoption increased from 48.6\% to 56.3\% (P = .03). Participation in
   health information exchange remained unchanged (54.5\% to 55.3\%, P =
   .8). The top barriers to EHR adoption cited were: a) the initial cost of
   HIT investment (67.9\%, n = 133), b) lack of technical IT staff (46.4\%,
   n = 91), and c) lack of fiscal incentives (45.8\%, n = 88). Comparing
   nursing homes with EHRs in 2012 to nursing homes with EHRs in 2013, the
   availability of many types of computerized functionalities significantly
   increased, although no gains were seen for order entry or clinical
   tools.
   Conclusions
   While some gains are being made by nursing homes, HIT adoption generally
   lags behind that of other sectors. Public policy focusing on building
   HIT infrastructure is essential to ensure that nursing homes keep up
   with other healthcare segments.}},

Abstract = {{Four months into a year-long, national survey assessing parents'
   experiences of a child's diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, our
   response fraction was only 23\%. We aimed to determine whether including

   randomised to receive a chocolate frog versus no chocolate frog. Both
   groups received a written reminder and replacement survey 2 weeks after
   the survey was posted and up to two telephone reminders thereafter. We
   analysed the effect of the incentive using (2) tests for the categorical
   response variable and t-tests for the continuous reminder and length of
   response variables at the end of (i) randomisation and (ii) the study
   (1November 2012). A total of 137 families were randomised in the 6-week

   describes the development and evaluation of the Consumer Assessment of
   Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) In-Center Hemodialysis Survey.
   Study Design: We conducted formative research to generate survey
   questions and performed statistical analyses to evaluate the survey's
   measurement properties.
   Setting \& Participants: Formative research included focus groups,
   cognitive interviews, and field testing the survey with dialysis
   patients.
   Measurements \& Outcomes: We assessed internal consistency reliability
   (Cronbach alpha) and center-level reliability for 3 multi-item scales.
   We evaluated construct validity using correlations of the scales with
   global ratings of the kidney doctor, staff, and dialysis center.
   Results: Response rate was 46\% (1,454 completed surveys). Analyses
   support 3 multi-item scales: Nephrologists' Communication and Caring (7
   items, alpha = 0.89), Quality of Dialysis Center Care and Operations (22
   items, alpha = 0.93), and Providing Information to Patients (11 items,
   alpha = 0.75). The communication scale was correlated the most strongly
   with the global rating of the ``kidney doctor{''} (r = 0.78). The
   Dialysis Center Care and Operations scale was correlated most strongly
   with global ratings of staff (r = 0.75) and the center (r = 0.69).
   Providing Information to Patients was correlated most strongly with the
   global rating of the staff (r = 0.41).
   Limitations: A relatively small number of patients completed the survey
   in Spanish.
   Conclusions: This study provides support for the reliability and
   validity of the CAHPS In-Center Hemodialysis Survey for assessing

   China. Key to leveraging this model is to attract consumer attention and
   stimulate their actions both online and offline, which may be achieved
   through information technology (IT)-enabled promotional approaches, such
   as administering banner adverts and digital coupons. The former focuses
   on communicating product attribute information, whereas the latter
   focuses on communicating incentives. Building on a collectivism cultural
   perspective, word-of-mouth (WOM) communication motives framework, and
   digital advertising literature, we hypothesize their different effects
   online (generating produce review) and offline (inducing sales). We
   first conducted a survey comparing consumers in China with their U. S.

Abstract = {{Physicians, like other professionals, are expected to draw from

   Using nationally representative U.S. survey data from the Community
   Tracking Study, this paper examines the degree to which physicians are

   mediate acquiescence rates through three mechanisms: constraints,
   protection, and incentives. We find that, based on physicians' reports
   of their responses to patients' suggestions, patient influence is rare.
   This influence is least likely to be felt in large workplaces, such as
   large private practices, hospitals, and medical schools. We find that
   the protection and incentives mechanisms mediate the relationship
   between workplace types and physician acquiescence but more prescriptive
   measures such as guidelines and formularies do not affect acquiescence.

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 30}},
Abstract = {{Financial (positive or negative) and non-financial incentives or rewards
   are increasingly used in attempts to influence health behaviours. While
   unintended consequences of incentive provision are discussed in the
   literature, evidence syntheses did not identify any primary research
   with the aim of investigating unintended consequences of incentive
   interventions for lifestyle behaviour change. Our objective was to
   investigate perceived positive and negative unintended consequences of
   incentive provision for a shortlist of seven promising incentive
   strategies for smoking cessation in pregnancy and breastfeeding. A
   multi-disciplinary, mixed-methods approach included involving two
   service-user mother and baby groups from disadvantaged areas with
   experience of the target behaviours as study co-investigators.
   Systematic reviews informed the shortlist of incentive strategies.
   Qualitative semi-structured interviews and a web-based survey of health
   professionals asked open questions on positive and negative consequences
   of incentives. The participants from three UK regions were a diverse
   sample with and without direct experience of incentive interventions: 88
   pregnant women/recent mothers/partners/family members; 53 service
   providers; 24 experts/decision makers and interactive discussions with
   63 conference attendees. Maternity and early years health professionals
   (n = 497) including doctors, midwives, health visitors, public health
   and related staff participated in the survey. Qualitative analysis
   identified ethical, political, cultural, social and psychological
   implications of incentive delivery at population and individual levels.
   Four key themes emerged: how incentives can address or create
   inequalities; enhance or diminish intrinsic motivation and wellbeing;
   have a positive or negative effect on relationships with others within
   personal networks or health providers; and can impact on health systems
   and resources by raising awareness and directing service delivery, but
   may be detrimental to other health care areas. Financial incentives are
   controversial and generated emotive and oppositional responses. The
   planning, design and delivery of future incentive interventions should
   evaluate unexpected consequences to inform the evidence for
   effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and future implementation.}},

Month = {{OCT 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Experiences and attitudes of clinical trainers of
   undergraduate medical students and postgraduate medical trainees in
   secondary care have received limited attention. Anecdotally, clinical
   teaching is becoming increasingly restricted by clinical service
   pressures, thereby presenting a risk to the quality of training
   provision.
   Methods: To explore the commitment, experience and attitudes of clinical
   teachers and trainers of undergraduate medical students and postgraduate
   trainees, respectively, amongst secondary care providers across a UK
   Healthcare Workforce Deanery, an invitation to complete a
   study-specific, on-line survey, comprising predominantly yes/no response
   and 5-point Likert scale statements with some open questions, was sent
   to all registered secondary care trainers/supervisors working in the
   East Midlands Strategic Health Authority. The survey was open between
   February and June 2012, with two reminders to complete. Responses were
   anonymised and the frequency of responses to questions was analysed.
   Data were analysed for the whole study population and for the
   relationship between frequency of responses and gender.
   Results: The majority of teachers/trainers considered that they were
   well prepared and fulfilled their clinical teaching responsibilities.
   Many reported having restricted time for preparation and delivery and
   that teaching activities were often completed in their own time. Despite
   reported poor support and low incentives, many respondents felt valued
   for their clinical teaching by their Medical Schools and the Deanery,
   but less so by hospital Trusts.
   Conclusions: Respondents indicated that some faculty like and enjoy
   clinical teaching despite lack of allocated time, resources and
   recognition. The majority indicated that they feel confident and
   competent in their clinical teaching roles. Insufficient dedicated time
   due to competing clinical service pressures was reported as the major
   barrier to clinical teaching provision.}},

Number = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: The Hookup is a collaborative project reaching young people
   in California with valuable sexual and reproductive health information
   and linkage to local resources. Due to limited access to subscriber
   contact information, it has been a challenge to evaluate the program.
   Objective: The aims of this study were to determine the feasibility of
   using text messaging (short message service, SMS) as an evaluation tool
   for an educational text message-based program and to evaluate the
   program itself.
   Methods: All subscribers of The Hookup were sent four survey questions
   via SMS about age, gender, location, referral source and behavior
   change. An incentive was offered for completing the survey and an
   opt-out option was provided in the initial message.
   Results: All existing subscribers of The Hookup (N=2477) received a
   request to complete the survey using the SMS application on their mobile
   phones. A total of 832 (33.6\%) subscribers responded to the initial
   question and 481 (20\%) answered all four questions. Of the responses,
   85\% were received in the first two hours of the initial request.
   Respondents who answered the question about behavior change, 90\%
   reported having made some positive change since subscribing to Hookup,
   including getting tested for STDs and HIV.
   Conclusions: The survey methodology initiated a high response rate from
   The Hookup subscribers. The survey was able to provide data about
   subscribers in a short time period at minimal cost. The results show
   potential for using mobile SMS applications to evaluate SMS campaigns.
   The findings also support using SMS to provide young people with sexual
   health prevention messaging and linkage to health services.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: In response to calls for more specificity when measuring
   physical activity, this study examined perceived correlates of this
   behavior in rural adults separately by the domain in which this behavior
   occurs (ie, home care, work, active living, and sport).
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was completed by 407 adults from 2
   rural towns in the Midwest. The questionnaire assessed the perceived
   social and physical environment, including neighborhood characteristics,
   as well as barriers to being active. The Kaiser Physical Activity Survey
   captured domain-specific activity levels. The response rate was 25\%.
   Multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine the associations
   between social and physical environment factors and domain-specific
   physical activity.
   Findings: Having a favorable attitude toward using government funds for
   exercise and activity-friendly neighborhood characteristic were
   positively associated with active living. Friends encouraging exercise
   was positively associated with participation in sport. Barriers were
   inversely associated with active living and sport. Total physical
   activity was positively associated with workplace incentives for
   exercise, favorable policy attitudes toward supporting physical
   education in schools and supporting the use of government funds for
   biking trails, and it was inversely associated with barriers. There were
   no factors associated with physical activity in the domains of work or
   home care.
   Conclusions: Correlates of physical activity are unique to the domain in
   which this behavior occurs. Programs to increase physical activity in
   rural adults should target policy attitudes, neighborhood
   characteristics, and social support from friends while also working to
   decrease personal barriers to exercise.}},

   Overall, 317 (60\%) fellows rated nephrology as difficult, particularly
   women (65.4\% vs. 49.5\%, p<0.001), with American women medical
   graduates rating nephrology as more difficult compared to all others (p
   = 0.001). More men than women (24\% vs. 8\%, p<0.001) considered the
   monetary benefit as not adequate. Program directors (25; 64\% response
   rate) represented 57\% of all USA fellows in training, and 15 (60\%)
   found it difficult to recruit qualified applicants. Of the 183 graduates
   in the past 10 years, 35 (19\%) were reported as not in the USA
   pediatric nephrology workforce. These findings support our belief that a
   strong effort needs to be made by the academic community to teach
   nephrology in more interesting and understandable formats. While these
   are national samples, we were unable to contact non-nephrology fellows
   directly and program directors from larger programs were
   underrepresented. Difficulties in attracting/retaining trainees
   (particularly women) to nephrology must be addressed systematically,
   identifying incentives to practice in this field. Bold concerted efforts
   are required and we propose seven steps to achieve this goal.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined how agricultural households involved in China's
   Sloping Land Conversion Program (SLCP) could respond to expected changes
   in environmental and livestock policies and changing commodity prices.
   We calibrated a farm household model using 2009 survey data collected in
   northeast Gansu Province, China, and examined the responses of four
   different household groups. Household groups were distinguished based on
   the resources they possessed for either cropping, livestock husbandry or
   off-farm employment. We also calculated the opportunity cost of
   converting sloping land from grain crop production to perennial grass
   production and included the net value of the replacement crop in these
   calculations. Our model simulations indicated that subsistence-oriented
   households were most likely to participate in the SLCP, and that SLCP
   payment reductions could have large negative income effects for this
   group. Reductions in SLCP payments increased income inequality among
   households in the study area. Migration- and cropping-oriented
   households have fewer incentives to participate in the SLCP. With rising
   commodity prices, SLCP payments need to rise to avoid that
   subsistence-oriented households reconvert their land from perennial
   grasses to annual grain crops. Local government policies related to
   livestock production are being devised in Gansu as a method to lift
   incomes, and these policies could also have positive environmental
   benefits by increasing grass production on sloping land. The
   introduction of these livestock promotion policies had modest income
   effects but did not alter the area grown with grasses under the SLCP.

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{108}},
Pages = {{43-56}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Although a large body of research exists discussing the subject of
   drought management and the mechanisms that are employed by farmers to
   formulate decisions during such an event, the farmers' response to
   drought remains poorly understood due to the oversimplified assumptions
   about farmers' behavior in response to drought. Furthermore, little is
   known about the potential efficacy of the coping strategies that are
   adopted by farmers. To gather this knowledge, a mixed method,
   qualitative-quantitative study was conducted in Fars province, Iran. A
   survey of 255 farmers, selected through a multistage stratified random
   sampling method, revealed that farmers' decisions to manage a drought
   were the result of a complex web of natural, economic, structural, and
   cognitive factors. Additionally, an analysis of decision models revealed
   that there were different patterns of coping responses utilized in the
   different stages of drought that expanded from short-term adjustment to
   long-term adaptation. Furthermore, a decision tree analysis indicated
   that although a large percentage of farmers made some adjustments in
   response to drought, they were not able to overcome the increasing
   impacts of the drought. In this respect, it was recommended to consider
   various economic incentives, promote affordable coping strategies, and
   combine agricultural interventions with social support services. (C)

Abstract = {{The present model of employment specified in the Mental Health Nurse
   Incentive Program (MHNIP) is closely aligned to a traditional practice
   nurse model whereby the nurse is employed to assist and extend medical
   practice.
   Mental health nurses working within MHNIP typically possess post
   graduate qualifications and a breadth of experience characteristic of a
   specialist and advanced practitioner in mental health.
   Mental health nurses ought to enjoy the same status, level of
   remuneration, professional esteem and accountability of other health
   professionals.
   AbstractThe Mental Health Nurse Incentive Programme (MHNIP) provides
   funding to organizations to enable mental health nurses (MHNs) to
   provide care to people with complex needs in primary care settings in
   Australia. The programme is based on a for and on-behalf of' practice
   nursing model whereby the MHN is presumed to have no specialist
   knowledge, skills or professional autonomy, and rather extends the reach
   of medicine. This paper provides a profile of MHNs working in the MHNIP
   derived from an online survey. A content analysis of responses
   establishes that nurses who work within MHNIP are highly experienced,
   and have extensive postgraduate qualifications particularly in
   psychotherapy. Nurses have negotiated a range of complex employment and
   contractual arrangements with organizations and pushed the boundaries of
   the programme to realize good outcomes. The practice nurse model' of
   employment and the underpinning assumptions about MHNs and their skill
   set relative to other professions is critically examined. Changes to the
   programme funding mechanism and programme specifications are
   recommended.}},

Abstract = {{Background. - Healthcare professionals play a critical role in women's
   choice of contraceptive methods. However, national surveys on sexual and
   reproductive health (SRH) among physicians are rare and present low
   participation rates. We conducted a randomized trial to test for the
   effectiveness of three interventions to improve survey participation of
   private physicians delivering reproductive health services in France.
   Methods. - The study comprised a national random sample of 500 general
   practitioners and 500 gynecologists working in private offices. All
   received a postal invitation to participate either by completing a
   paper, phone or online questionnaire. Physicians were randomly assigned
   to six groups to test for the effect of three interventions: a
   non-monetary incentive in the form of a scientific book, telephone
   contact, and the possibility of completing the questionnaire by phone.
   Results. - Overall, 362 questionnaires were collected (26 online, 2 by
   phone) and 58 physicians were ineligible. The completion rate increased
   from 26.7\% in physicians who received no intervention to 42.7\% in
   those who received the book and a phone call. The phone call increased
   the completion rate by 11\% percentage points (P = 0.01), while the book
   had no significant effect. Results from multivariate logistic
   regressions also indicate that gynecologists (OR = 1.6) and female
   physicians (OR = 1.5) were more likely to participate than others.
   Conclusion. - The results suggest that phone calls substantially
   increase participation of physicians in sexual and reproductive health
   surveys but have little impact on sampling distortion. Differentials in
   response rates by physicians' characteristics should be considered in
   future SRH studies among physicians. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

Title = {{Impact of different privacy conditions and incentives on survey response
   rate, participant representativeness, and disclosure of sensitive
   information: a randomized controlled trial}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{JUL 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: Anonymous survey methods appear to promote greater
   disclosure of sensitive or stigmatizing information compared to
   non-anonymous methods. Higher disclosure rates have traditionally been
   interpreted as being more accurate than lower rates. We examined the
   impact of 3 increasingly private mailed survey conditions-ranging from
   potentially identifiable to completely anonymous-on survey response and
   on respondents' representativeness of the underlying sampling frame,
   completeness in answering sensitive survey items, and disclosure of
   sensitive information. We also examined the impact of 2 incentives (\$10
   versus \$20) on these outcomes.
   Methods: A 3X2 factorial, randomized controlled trial of 324
   representatively selected, male Gulf War I era veterans who had applied
   for United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability
   benefits. Men were asked about past sexual assault experiences,
   childhood abuse, combat, other traumas, mental health symptoms, and
   sexual orientation. We used a novel technique, the pre-merged
   questionnaire, to link anonymous responses to administrative data.
   Results: Response rates ranged from 56.0\% to 63.3\% across privacy
   conditions (p = 0.49) and from 52.8\% to 68.1\% across incentives (p =
   0.007). Respondents' characteristics differed by privacy and by
   incentive assignments, with completely anonymous respondents and \$20
   respondents appearing least different from their non-respondent
   counterparts. Survey completeness did not differ by privacy or by
   incentive. No clear pattern of disclosing sensitive information by
   privacy condition or by incentive emerged. For example, although all
   respondents came from the same sampling frame, estimates of sexual abuse
   ranged from 13.6\% to 33.3\% across privacy conditions, with the highest
   estimate coming from the intermediate privacy condition (p = 0.007).
   Conclusion: Greater privacy and larger incentives do not necessarily
   result in higher disclosure rates of sensitive information than lesser
   privacy and lower incentives. Furthermore, disclosure of sensitive or
   stigmatizing information under differing privacy conditions may have
   less to do with promoting or impeding participants' ``honesty{''} or
   ``accuracy{''} than with selectively recruiting or attracting
   subpopulations that are higher or lower in such experiences. Pre-merged
   questionnaires bypassed many historical limitations of anonymous surveys
   and hold promise for exploring non-response issues in future research.}},

Title = {{Impact of San Francisco's Toy Ordinance on Restaurants and Children's
   Food Purchases, 2011-2012}},
Journal = {{PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Introduction
   In 2011, San Francisco passed the first citywide ordinance to improve
   the nutritional standards of children's meals sold at restaurants by
   preventing the giving away of free toys or other incentives with meals
   unless nutritional criteria were met. This study examined the impact of
   the Healthy Food Incentives Ordinance at ordinance-affected restaurants
   on restaurant response (eg, toy-distribution practices, change in
   children's menus), and the energy and nutrient content of all orders and
   children's-meal only orders purchased for children aged 0 through 12
   years.
   Methods
   Restaurant responses were examined from January 2010 through March 2012.
   Parent caregiver/child dyads (n = 762) who were restaurant customers
   were surveyed at 2 points before and 1 seasonally matched point after
   ordinance enactment at Chain A and B restaurants (n = 30) in 2011 and
   2012.
   Results
   Both restaurant chains responded to the ordinance by selling toys
   separately from children's meals, but neither changed their menus to
   meet ordinance-specified nutrition criteria. Among children for whom
   children's meals were purchased, significant decreases in kilocalories,
   sodium, and fat per order were likely due to changes in children's side
   dishes and beverages at Chain A.
   Conclusion Although the changes at Chain A did not appear to be directly
   in response to the ordinance, the transition to a more healthful
   beverage and default side dish was consistent with the intent of the
   ordinance. Study results underscore the importance of policy wording,
   support the concept that more healthful defaults may be a powerful
   approach for improving dietary intake, and suggest that public policies
   may contribute to positive restaurant changes.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{There is anecdotal evidence that the adoption of building information
   modeling (BIM) is on the increase. However, the extent to which quantity
   surveyors (QS) (also referred to as cost consultants or cost engineers)
   are now using BIM features is not clear. The research reported in this
   paper was aimed at understanding the BIM experience of QS firms and cost
   consultants in Australia as well as to understand the progress they have
   made towards the use of BIM features. Data collection was a web-based
   survey of 180 QS firms with 40 responses and two in-depth interviews.
   Findings from the study show that BIM features are not readily used by
   QS firms owing to uncertainties concerning the integrity of
   three-dimensional (3D) models issued by designers, incomplete
   information in models, lack of knowledge concerning new business
   processes to drive the use of BIM use, lack of demand by clients, cost
   of implementing BIM features within the existing practice and learning
   time required to adopt BIM features. It appears that most of the firms
   have experience in computer aided take-off with two-dimensional (2D)
   drawing in the project's front end tasks such as cost planning and bill
   of quantities. Most of them have little experience with automated
   extraction of quantities using 3D models. Only one experience the use of
   BIM features in contract administration duties. 3D computer-aided
   drawing (CAD) drawings are used only for visualization. In many
   BIM-based projects reported, cost consultants were not issued the 3D BIM
   developed by designers; instead, 2D drawings were issued to the QS for
   quantity take-off and cost estimation. In cases where automatic quantity
   extraction was performed using 3D models, there seems to be lack of
   clarity concerning the time savings achieved because the QS spent more
   time checking the accuracy of the 3D model prior to quantity extraction
   as well as sorting, and splitting take-off items. In the absence of
   trust in the integrity of 3D models, QS would prefer to use the manual
   on screen take-off using 2D drawings and 3D for visualization. Also, in
   the absence of industry-wide standard for classifying, and coding
   construction works, QS would have no incentive to switch to
   five-dimensional (5D) BIM estimating. Ways of increasing the use of BIM
   features by QS are highlighted. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{Introduction and Aims. Many young adults are risky drinkers who are
   often missed by general population surveys. The aim of the present study
   was to assess factors affecting participation rates in a street
   intercept approach to recruiting young adult bar-goers for an online
   survey. Design and Methods. Two hundred eighty-seven young adults were
   approached as they entered the bar district of a medium-sized city on
   two consecutive weekend nights. Of these, 170 met eligibility
   requirements and were invited to complete a 2 min street survey for
   which they were paid \$5 and given a gift card for \$50 or \$100 to be
   redeemed when they completed a follow-up online survey. Results.
   Sixty-one per cent of eligible persons (n = 104) participated in the
   street survey, with greater participation on the second night (74\% vs.
   50\%). Sixty-eight per cent (n = 71) of those who participated in the
   street survey completed the online survey, with no differences in
   response by age or student status; however, men were significantly more
   likely to complete the online survey if they received the higher
   incentive, had consumed less alcohol and were recruited before midnight.
   The larger incentive was especially effective at increasing completion
   rates for men who had consumed a larger amount of alcohol. Discussion
   and Conclusions. Street intercept is an effective and efficient
   recruitment method that can measure both drinking and other experiences
   in the event and link these data to information collected in follow-up
   research. Unlike recruitment through convenience samples, response rates
   and response bias can also be assessed.}},

Abstract = {{The incentive dilemma refers to a situation in which incentives are
   offered but do not work as intended. The authors suggest that, in an

   works is a function of how it is evaluated by an agent: for its
   contribution to the agent's bottom line (instrumental evaluation) and
   for the extent it is strategically aligned with the agent's direction
   (congruence evaluation). To further understand when incentives work, the
   influence of two key contextual variables-industry volatility and
   dependence-are examined. A field study featuring 57 semi-structured
   depth interviews and 386 responses from twin surveys in the information
   technology and brewing industries provide data for hypothesis testing.
   When and whether incentives work is demonstrated by certain conditions
   under which the agent's evaluation of an incentive has positive or

Abstract = {{Purpose. A national census survey of optometrists in Canada measured
   knowledge of ocular diseases associated with smoking cigarettes and
   current practice behaviors related to addressing tobacco use with
   patients, including prevention and cessation. Optometrists were also
   asked to identify tools to assist addressing tobacco use with patients.
   Methods. An online bilingual (English/French) survey was developed and
   an e-mail with a link to the survey was sent to all 4528 optometrists
   registered in Canada. No participation incentives were provided.
   Frequency data were tabulated for survey items. Logistic regression
   models were fit to understand respondent characteristics associated with
   discussing tobacco use prevention and cessation with patients.
   Results. The response rate was 19\% (850 responses). Almost all
   respondents (98\%) believed that smoking cigarettes was a risk factor
   for developing age-related macular degeneration; approximately half
   (55\%) assessed the smoking status of patients during their initial
   visit; 7\% reported that they discussed the benefits of tobacco use
   prevention with patients younger than 19 years; and 33\% reported that
   they always or regularly assess their patients' interest in quitting
   smoking. Respondents who completed the survey in English were more
   likely (odds ratio, 2.4; 95\% confidence interval, 1.01 to 5.65) to
   deliver prevention messaging, compared with respondents who completed
   the survey in French. Male respondents were less likely to assess
   patients' interest in quitting (odds ratio, 0.7; 95\% confidence
   interval, 0.50 to 0.97) than female respondents. Most respondents (90\%)
   were interested in a continuing education program about the impact of
   smoking on vision and eye health as well as strategies for discussing
   tobacco cessation and prevention.
   Conclusions. Optometrists are aware of the impact of smoking on ocular
   health; however, most respondents do not systematically engage in
   tobacco use prevention and cessation practices. Providing optometrists
   with tools, including continuing education, may help support patient
   conversations about the risks of tobacco use and improve public health.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the preferences of general practitioners (GPs) in
   training for organizational characteristics in general practice with
   focus on aspects that can mitigate problems with GP shortages.
   A discrete choice experiment was used to investigate preferences for the
   attributes practice type, number of GPs in general practice,
   collaboration with other practices, change in weekly working hours
   (administrative versus patient related), and change in yearly surplus.
   In May 2011, all doctors actively engaged in the family medicine program
   in Denmark were invited to participate in a web-based survey. A total of
   485 GPs in training responded to the questionnaire, resulting in a
   response rate of 56 \%.
   A mixed logit model showed that GPs in training prefer to work in
   smaller shared practices (2 GPs). This stands in contrast to the
   preferences of current GPs. Hence, a generational change in the GP
   population is likely to introduce more productive practice forms, and
   problems with GP shortages are likely to be mitigated over the coming
   years. Results further showed that a majority of the respondents are
   willing to work in larger shared practices (with 3-4 GPs) if they
   receive an increase in surplus (approximately 50,000 DKK/6,719 EUR per
   year) and that they may be willing to take in more patient-related work
   if the increase in surplus is sufficient (approximately 200,000
   DKK/26,875 EUR per year for 5 extra hours per week). Monetary incentives
   may therefore be an effective tool for further improving productivity.}},

   The situation in which one of the project parties is better informed

   hazard, and hold up. The focus here is on strategies for minimizing
   information asymmetries in the construction phase. A survey of project
   managers was conducted to establish an understanding of the relative
   importance of risk-minimization strategies established in the

   incentives (bonuses), corporate culture, reputation, and trust. The
   multi-attribute utility theory was used to analyze the responses.

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Ten years ago, the specialty of trauma surgery was
   considered to be in crisis. Since then, the Eastern Association for the
   Surgery of Trauma (EAST) created a position paper, and acute care
   surgery (ACS) has matured. A repeat survey of EAST members is indicated
   to evaluate the progress of ACS.
   METHODS: A survey was e-mailed to EAST members. Results were evaluated
   and compared with the previous position paper and survey.
   RESULTS: The response rate was 15\%. More than three fourths of the
   respondents were male, and just less than one fourth of them were
   female. More than half of the respondents were in practice for less than
   10 years. Seventy-three percent were involved in research, although only
   16\% were allotted protected time. Most respondents felt that
   reimbursement for their effort was inadequate: 54\% thought
   reimbursement was fair for trauma care, 59\% for critical care, 49\% for
   nontrauma ACS, and 62\% for general surgery. The biggest incentive to a
   career in ACS was that it was a challenging and exciting activity; the
   biggest disincentive was working at night. Seventy-two percent expressed
   satisfaction with their career profile, and 92\% were either very or
   somewhat happy with their career. Sixty-six percent did feel either
   somewhat or very burned out. Surgeons were interested in learning more
   about contract negotiation, business/managerial issues, and
   billing/coding. Compared with the previous survey, overall career
   satisfaction seems stable.
   CONCLUSION: Most surgeons are satisfied with a career in ACS. There are
   still some facets of the career that warrant improvement. Focus on
   surgeon satisfaction may lead to enhancements in patient care. (J Trauma

   slums: a prospective cohort study}},
Journal = {{HUMAN RESOURCES FOR HEALTH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{MAY 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Volunteer community health workers (CHWs) are a key approach
   to improving community-based maternal and child health services in
   developing countries. BRAC, a large Bangladeshi non-governmental
   organization (NGO), has employed female volunteer CHWs in its
   community-based health programs since 1977, recently including its
   Manoshi project, a community-based maternal and child health
   intervention in the urban slums of Bangladesh. A case-control study
   conducted in response to high dropout rates in the first year of the
   project showed that financial incentives, social prestige, community
   approval and household responsibilities were related to early retention
   in the project. In our present prospective cohort study, we aimed to
   better understand the factors associated with retention of volunteer
   CHWs once the project was more mature.
   Methods: We used a prospective cohort study design to examine the
   factors affecting retention of volunteer CHWs who remained in the
   project after the initial start-up period. We surveyed a random sample
   of 542 CHWs who were working for BRAC Manoshi in December 2008. In
   December 2009, we revisited this cohort of CHWs and interviewed those
   who had dropped out about the main reasons for their dropping out. We
   used a multivariable generalized linear model regression analysis with a
   log link to estimate the relative risk (RR) of independent factors on
   retention.
   Results: Of the 542 CHWs originally enrolled, 120 had dropped out by the
   end of one year, mainly because they left the slums. CHWs who received
   positive community appraisal (adjusted RR = 1.45, 95\% confidence
   interval (CI) = 1.10 to 1.91) or were associated with other NGOs
   (adjusted RR = 1.13, 95\% CI = 1.04 to 1.23) were more likely to have
   been retained in the project. Although refresher training was also
   associated with increased retention (adjusted RR = 2.25, 95\% CI = 1.08
   to 4.71) in this study, too few CHWs had not attended refresher training
   regularly to make it a meaningful predictor of retention that could be
   applied in the project setting.
   Conclusion: Factors that affect retention of CHWs may change over time,
   with some factors that are important in the early years of a project
   losing importance as the project matures. Community health programs
   operating in fragile urban slums should consider changing factors over
   program duration for better retention of volunteer CHWs.}},

Abstract = {{Background: A training physician has his first interaction with a
   pharmaceutical representative during medical school. Medical students
   are often provided with small gifts such as pens, calendars and books,
   as well as free lunches as part of drug promotion offers. Ethical impact
   of these transactions as perceived by young medical students has not
   been investigated in Pakistan before. This study aimed to assess the
   association of socio-demographic variables with the attitudes of medical
   students towards pharmaceutical companies and their incentives.
   Methods: As part of a cross-sectional survey, a validated questionnaire
   previously used for assessing attitude of medical students towards
   pharmaceutical industry, was modified, pre-tested and distributed among
   consenting clinical year students at DUHS and AKU. Questions included
   acceptability of pharmaceutically sponsored gifts, events and tuition
   fee, and their impact on future prescription. Responses were graded as
   agree, disagree or neutral which were then scored according to the AMSA
   guidelines of ethical conduct.
   Results: Out of a total of 353 targeted students 303 responded,
   corresponding to a response rate of 85.8\%. Responses indicated that
   42.7\% students believed in no interaction with drug companies during
   medical school. However, 81\% of students favored pharmaceutical
   sponsorship of student-body events/seminars at medical colleges. More
   than one-third of the students were comfortable receiving gifts from
   drug companies. Overall, the results of this study offer an interesting
   comparison between the students of a private medical school (AKU) and a
   public medical school (DUHS); AKU students exhibited a greater degree of
   mistrust towards drug information provided by pharmaceutical companies
   compared to DUHS students (p = 0.040). Furthermore, when asked if there
   was a need to incorporate guidelines in the undergraduate curriculum
   with regard to interaction with drug companies, 84.2\% students at AKU
   agreed, compared to 54.9\% at DUHS. Medical student Attitude Scores are
   more or less similar to each other independent of their various
   demographical differences.
   Conclusion: This study highlights that medical students in our
   population have a high level of acceptability towards incentives offered
   by pharmaceutical industry and that formal guidance regarding the
   subject should be incorporated into medical curriculum.}},

   investigate reputational influences and, indeed, we find that
   reputational concerns are important-69 percent of executives rate
   reputation as important and the factor ranks second in order of
   importance among all factors explaining why firms do not adopt a
   potential tax planning strategy. We also find that financial accounting
   incentives play a role. For example, 84 percent of publicly traded firms
   respond that top management at their company cares at least as much
   about the GAAP ETR as they do about cash taxes paid and 57 percent of

   OBJECTIVE To determine the association between hospice ownership and (1)
   provision of community benefits, (2) setting and timing of the hospice
   population served, and (3) community outreach.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional survey (the National

   conducting research (18\% vs 23\%; ARR, 0.67 {[}95\% CI, 0.46-0.99]),
   and providing charity care (80\% vs 82\%; ARR, 0.88 {[}95\% CI,
   0.80-0.96]). For-profit compared with nonprofit hospices cared for a
   larger proportion of patients with longer expected hospice stays
   including those in nursing homes (30\% vs 25\%; P =.009). For-profit
   hospices were more likely to exceed Medicare's aggregate annual cap
   (22\% vs 4\%; ARR, 3.66 {[}95\% CI, 2.02-6.63]) and had a higher patient
   disenrollment rate (10\% vs 6\%; P <.001). For-profit were more likely
   than nonprofit hospices to engage in outreach to low-income communities
   (61\% vs 46\%; ARR, 1.23 {[}95\% CI, 1.05-1.44]) and minority
   communities (59\% vs 48\%; ARR, 1.18 {[}95\% CI, 1.02-1.38]) and less
   likely to partner with oncology centers (25\% vs 33\%; ARR, 0.59 {[}95\%
   CI, 0.44-0.80]).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Ownership-related differences are apparent
   among hospices in community benefits, population served, and community
   outreach. Although Medicare's aggregate annual cap may curb the
   incentive to focus on long-stay hospice patients, additional regulatory
   measures such as public reporting of hospice disenrollment rates should
   be considered as the share of for-profit hospices in the United States
   continues to increase.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Most men diagnosed with prostate cancer become long-term
   survivors, but are at risk for medical late-effects that can affect
   their long-term health. Mailed surveys are well suited to study
   late-effects in this population, but low response rates can compromise
   survey validity. This study investigated whether an unconditional \$5.00
   gift certificate incentive or Priority Mail delivery increased prostate
   cancer survivors' response to mailed surveys.
   Materials and Methods: 976 participants (mean age = 66.8 years), 2-8
   years post-diagnosis, were randomized to one of four groups: Incentive;
   Priority Mail; Incentive \& Priority Mail; or Control. After an
   introductory letter, initial study packets were mailed based on
   randomization; 46 days later, a second study packet was mailed to all
   non-responders by First-Class Mail.
   Results: The first mailing yielded a significant variation in response
   rates across groups (chi(2) = 9.34; p = 0.025). Priority Mail (64.7\%; p
   = 0.008) and Incentive \& Priority Mail (63.6\%; p = 0.016) groups had
   significantly higher response rates than Controls (52.9\%). After the
   second mailing, the overall response rate increased significantly from
   59.6\% to 71.4\% (p < 0.001); however, response rates no longer differed
   across groups (range, 69.3\% {[}Incentive group] to 73.9\% {[}Priority
   Mail group]).
   Conclusions: Long-term prostate cancer survivors' response rates to
   mailed surveys increased with the use of Priority Mail and a repeat
   survey mailing, but the unconditional gift certificate incentive was not
   supported in this population. By identifying and applying specialized
   survey methods, studies targeting survivors of prostate cancer and other
   geriatric cancers may improve response rates, thus limiting a source of
   potential bias. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{When communicating with farmers and ranchers, land conservation
   professionals would be better equipped if they understood key influences
   on their target audience's decisions to permanently preserve their land
   from development. This study predicted key factors influencing rancher
   engagement in a conservation easement (CE) agreement. Specifically,
   theory of planned behavior, trust, environmental identity, past
   behavior, perceptions of specific CE characteristics and selected
   participant demographics were used as predictors. A mixed-methods
   approach was applied involving interviews, a two-phase pilot study, and
   a statewide mail-administered questionnaire. Final interview domains
   guided the quantitative survey instrument, which was administered to
   1,000 Florida cattle ranchers. A 60\% response rate was received.
   Multiple linear regression demonstrated ranchers were more likely to
   enter into a CE agreement if they 1) had a positive attitude about the
   outcomes associated with CEs; 2) felt influential others would
   positively support CEs; 3) indicated higher trust in conservation
   organizations and agencies; 4) believed their land had significant
   conservation value; 5) supported sale or donation of certain property
   rights; and 6) were positively influenced by financial incentives,
   primarily estate tax deductions. These six variables explained over 50\%

Abstract = {{Despite its theoretical prominence and sound principles, integrated pest
   management (IPM) continues to suffer from anemic adoption rates in
   developing countries. To shed light on the reasons, we surveyed the
   opinions of a large and diverse pool of IPM professionals and
   practitioners from 96 countries by using structured concept mapping. The
   first phase of this method elicited 413 open-ended responses on
   perceived obstacles to IPM. Analysis of responses revealed 51 unique
   statements on obstacles, the most frequent of which was ``insufficient
   training and technical support to farmers.{''} Cluster analyses, based
   on participant opinions, grouped these unique statements into six
   themes: research weaknesses, outreach weaknesses, IPM weaknesses, farmer
   weaknesses, pesticide industry interference, and weak adoption
   incentives. Subsequently, 163 participants rated the obstacles expressed
   in the 51 unique statements according to importance and remediation
   difficulty. Respondents from developing countries and high-income
   countries rated the obstacles differently. As a group,
   developing-country respondents rated ``IPM requires collective action
   within a farming community{''} as their top obstacle to IPM adoption.
   Respondents from high-income countries prioritized instead the
   ``shortage of well-qualified IPM experts and extensionists.{''}
   Differential prioritization was also evident among developing-country
   regions, and when obstacle statements were grouped into themes. Results
   highlighted the need to improve the participation of stakeholders from
   developing countries in the IPM adoption debate, and also to situate the
   debate within specific regional contexts.}},

   Background: Failures in intraoperative teamwork are among the leading
   causes of preventable patient injury and death in surgical patients.
   Teamwork training, particularly using simulation, can be an effective
   intervention but is difficult to scale.
   Methods: A malpractice insurer convened a collaborative with 4
   Harvard-affiliated simulation programs to develop a standardized
   operating room teamwork training curriculum, including principles of
   communication, assertiveness, and use of the World Health Organization
   Surgical Safety Checklist. Participant teams were compensated for lost
   operative time via malpractice premium discounts, continuing education
   credits, and compensation for lost wages. The course was delivered

Title = {{The effect of cigarette prices on brand-switching in China: a
   longitudinal analysis of data from the ITC China Survey}},
Journal = {{TOBACCO CONTROL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{54-60}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Recent studies have found that Chinese smokers are relatively
   unresponsive to cigarette prices. As the Chinese government contemplates
   higher tobacco taxes, it is important to understand the reasons for this
   low response. One possible explanation is that smokers buffer themselves
   from rising cigarette prices by switching to cheaper cigarette brands.
   Objective
   This study examines how cigarette prices influence consumers' choices of
   cigarette brands in China.
   Methods
   This study uses panel data from the first three waves of the
   International Tobacco Control China Survey, drawn from six large cities
   in China and collected between 2006 and 2009. The study sample includes
   3477 smokers who are present in at least two waves (8552 person-years).
   Cigarette brands are sorted by price into four tiers, using excise tax
   categories to determine the cut-off for each tier. The analysis relies
   on a conditional logit model to identify the relationship between price
   and brand choice.
   Findings
   Overall, 38\% of smokers switched price tiers from one wave to the next.
   A yen 1 change in the price of cigarettes alters the tier choice of
   4-7\% of smokers. Restricting the sample to those who chose each given
   tier at baseline, a yen 1 increase in price in a given tier would
   decrease the share choosing that tier by 4\% for Tier 1 and 1-2\% for
   Tiers 2 and 3.
   Conclusions
   China's large price spread across cigarette brands appears to alter the
   brand selection of some consumers, especially smokers of cheaper brands.
   Tobacco pricing and tax policy can influence consumers' incentives to
   switch brands. In particular, whereas ad valorem taxes in a tiered
   pricing system like China's encourage trading down, specific excise
   taxes discourage the practice.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the local community incentive programs to improve
   traditional forest management in three forested villages in Baneh city,
   Kurdistan province in the northern Zagros forests of western Iran.
   Zagros forests cover 6.07 million ha and support rich plant and animal
   diversity. Changes in local community social and economic systems and
   the inefficiency of traditional forest management led to a critical
   situation in the stability of forest regeneration in recent decades. Due
   to a shortage of productive and arable lands and resulting unemployment
   and poverty, people overexploited the Zagros forests. Outside
   intervention in traditional forest management creates conflicts between
   local peoples and forest management organizations. To achieve
   sustainable forest management, including forest resources conservation
   and improvement of natural resource based livelihoods of communities, it
   is desirable to implement Forestry Incentive Programs (FIP) based on the
   important functions of forests. Detailed information on the
   socio-economics of communities, the effect of forests on local
   livelihoods, and lists of products extracted from the forest were
   obtained from a survey of local communities though questionnaire,
   interview and observation. We studied 276 households in three villages
   and completed 76 questionnaires by householders in the quantitative
   analysis. Sampling was performed by simple random sampling (SRS). The
   needs of rural communities, such as livestock husbandry, mainly arise
   from the characteristics and environmental features of villages. We
   identified the driving forces, pressures, status, impacts and responses
   (DPSIR) to design incentive programs, by DPSIR analysis and interaction
   analysis. Evaluation of local community benefits from forests showed
   that in order to improve forest management, 319 dollars per year would
   be needed by each family as an incentive in 2010 to prevent lopping and
   firewood collecting, the main causes of forest degradation.}},

Abstract = {{IntroductionProjected shortages in the primary care workforce underlie a
   need for more women's health care providers. In order to prepare more
   midwives to address this deficit, educators require additional clinical
   placement sites for students. The purpose of this study was to determine
   factors that influence practicing midwives to serve as preceptors.
   MethodsAn e-mail invitation to participate in an online survey was sent
   to 7658 current and lapsed members of the American College of Nurse-
   Midwives (ACNM), who provided ACNM with a valid e-mail address. The
   survey assessed factors that enabled or were barriers for midwifery
   preceptors. Forced-choice questions were analyzed using descriptive
   statistics. Participant comments were analyzed using qualitative
   descriptive methods.
   ResultsThere were a total of 1517 surveys completed, for a response rate
   of 19.8\%. Participants were primarily certified nurse-midwives (96.0\%)
   who were in clinical practice (83.9\%), with 78.0\% in full-scope
   clinical practice. Participants represented all geographic regions of
   the United States. The majority of the participants indicated they or
   someone in their practice could precept a midwifery student. A
   commitment to the midwifery profession was the most commonly identified
   motivating factor (58.5\%). Larger practices were more likely to precept
   midwifery students and to accept more than one student at a time. The
   most frequently identified barrier to precepting was the need to
   maintain a high patient volume (6.9\%). Write-in comments were provided
   by approximately 500 participants and coded into 9 themes: payment,
   barriers to precepting, incentives, student characteristics, mechanisms
   for placement, communication, giving back, preceptor qualifications, and
   professional issues.
   DiscussionThere is a strong commitment from preceptors to give back to
   the profession through the teaching of the future generation of
   midwives. Many of the barriers to precepting could be addressed by ACNM,
   the Accreditation Commission for Midwifery Education, and individual
   midwifery education programs.}},

   utility assumption. We test our theory using a field experiment

   consistent theoretical predictions and cast doubt on the relevance of a
   large experimental literature using inconsequential questions and
   non-incentive-compatible mechanisms to make inferences about CV. The

Title = {{Effects of financial incentives on motivating physical activity among
   older adults: results from a discrete choice experiment}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{FEB 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: There is extensive evidence that regular physical activity
   confers numerous health benefits. Despite this, high rates of physical
   inactivity prevail among older adults. This study aimed to ascertain if
   incentives could be effective in motivating physical activity through
   improving uptake of walking programs, either with or without an
   enrolment fee to cover corresponding costs.
   Methods: A discrete-choice conjoint survey was fielded to a national
   sample of older adults in Singapore. Each respondent was given ten pairs
   of hypothetical walking programs and asked to choose the option they
   preferred. Each option varied along several dimensions, including the
   level and type (cash, voucher, or health savings credit) of incentive
   and an enrolment fee. For each option, they were asked how likely they
   would be to join their preferred program. A random utility model (RUM)
   was used to analyze the responses.
   Results: Results suggest that a free 6-month program with a \$500 cash
   incentive would generate enrolment rates of 58.5\%; charging \$50 to
   enroll lowers this to 55.7\%. In terms of incentive type, cash payments
   were the most preferred incentive but not significantly different from
   supermarket vouchers. Both were preferred to health savings credits and
   sporting goods vouchers. Concerns of adverse selection were minimal
   because those who were inactive represented at least 72\% of new
   participants for any offered program(s) and were the majority.
   Conclusions: Study results demonstrate the potential for even modest
   incentives to increase program uptake among inactive older adults.
   Moreover, although cash was the most preferred option, supermarket
   vouchers, which could potentially be purchased at a discount, were a
   close alternative. Results also suggest that an enrolment fee is a
   viable option to offset the costs of incentives as it has only minimal
   impact on participation.}},

Abstract = {{Surveys can increase market transparency when information asymmetries
   are present-but this will only happen when respondents answer questions
   truthfully. Sometimes, however, it might not be in the respondents' best
   interest to provide truthful information on their firm or market. This
   will be especially true when other firms can exploit any information
   they provide. Understanding when, and under what conditions, respondents
   answer questions truthfully is important to researchers studying these
   markets and to policymakers using firm surveys to identify ways of
   improving the business environment. Using data from two countries in
   South Asia, this paper uses a random response technique to identify
   respondents that do not answer truthfully. We label these respondents as
   `reticent'. We show that respondents become more reticent when their
   firms face intense price competition. We argue that this is because
   intense competition gives respondents a greater incentive to misreport

Pages = {{62-72}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We report evidence from a large field experiment that compares the
   effectiveness of contingent and noncontingent incentives in eliciting
   costly effort for a large range of payment levels. The company with
   which we worked sent 7,250 letters asking customers to complete a
   survey. Some letters promised to pay amounts ranging from \$1 to \$30
   upon compliance (contingent incentives), whereas others already
   contained the money in the request envelopes (noncontingent incentives).
   Compared to no payment, very small contingent payments lower the
   response rate while small noncontingent payments raise the response
   rate. As expected, response rates rise with the size of the incentive
   offered. The response rate in the noncontingent incentives rises more
   rapidly for low amounts of incentive, but then flattens out and reaches
   lower levels than under contingent payments. We discuss how the optimal
   policy regarding the use of each size and type of incentives crucially
   depends on firms' objectives.}},

Title = {{Physician beliefs about the impact of meaningful use of the EHR A
   Cross-Sectional Study}},
Journal = {{APPLIED CLINICAL INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{789-801}},
Abstract = {{Background: As adoption and use of electronic health records (EHRs)
   grows in the United States, there is a growing need in the field of
   applied clinical informatics to evaluate physician perceptions and
   beliefs about the impact of EHRs. The meaningful use of EHR incentive
   program provides a suitable context to examine physician beliefs about
   the impact of EHRs.
   Objective: Contribute to the sparse literature on physician beliefs
   about the impact of EHRs in areas such as quality of care, effectiveness
   of care, and delivery of care.
   Methods: A cross-sectional online survey of physicians at two academic
   medical centers (AMCs) in the northeast who were preparing to qualify
   for the meaningful use of EHR incentive program.
   Results: Of the 1,797 physicians at both AMCs who were preparing to
   qualify for the incentive program, 967 completed the survey for an
   overall response rate of 54\%. Only 23\% and 27\% of physicians agreed
   or strongly agreed that meaningful use of the EHR will help them improve
   the care they personally deliver and improve quality of care
   respectively. Physician specialty was significantly associated with
   beliefs; e. g., 35\% of primary care physicians agreed or strongly
   agreed that meaningful use will improve quality of care compared to 26\%
   of medical specialists and 21\% of surgical specialists (p=0.009).
   Satisfaction with outpatient EHR was also significantly related to all
   belief items.
   Conclusions: Only about a quarter of physicians in our study responded
   positively that meaningful use of the EHR will improve quality of care
   and the care they personally provide. These findings are similar to and
   extend findings from qualitative studies about negative perceptions that
   physicians hold about the impact of EHRs. Factors outside of the
   regulatory context, such as physician beliefs, need to be considered in
   the implementation of the meaningful use of the EHR incentive program.}},

Title = {{Medical student debt and major life choices other than specialty}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL EDUCATION ONLINE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{19}},
Abstract = {{Background: Median indebtedness at graduation is now more than \$170,000
   for graduates of US Medical Schools. Debate still exists as to whether
   higher debt levels influence students to choose high paying non-primary
   care specialties. Notably, no previous research on the topic has taken
   into account cost of attendance when constructing a debt model, nor has
   any research examined the non-career major life decisions that medical
   students face.
   Methods: Medical students were surveyed using an anonymous electronic
   instrument developed for this study. The survey was delivered through a
   link included in a study email and students were recruited from school
   wide listservs and through snowball sampling (students were encouraged
   to share a link to the survey with other medical students). No
   incentives were offered for survey completion.
   Results: Responses were recorded from 102 US Allopathic medical schools
   (n = 3,032), with 22 institutions (11 public, 11 private) meeting
   inclusion criteria of 10\% student body response proportion (n = 1,846).
   Students with higher debt relative to their peers at their home
   institution reported higher frequencies of feeling callous towards
   others, were more likely to choose a specialty with a higher average
   annual income, were less likely to plan to practice in underserved
   locations, and were less likely to choose primary care specialties.
   Students with higher aggregate amounts of medical student loan debt were
   more likely to report high levels of stress from their educational debt,
   to delay getting married and to report disagreement that they would
   choose to become a physician again, if given the opportunity to revisit
   that choice. Increases in both aggregate and relative debt were
   associated with delaying having children, delaying buying a house,
   concerns about managing and paying back educational debt, and worrying
   that educational debt will influence one's specialty choice.
   Conclusions: Medical student debt and particularly debt relative to
   peers at the same institution appears to influence the way that students
   approach major life choices like when to start a family, when to buy a
   home, and what specialty to choose. Future research should take into
   account cost of attendance when looking for the impact of medical
   student debt on major life choices.}},

Title = {{OVERSIGHT IN PRIVATE FOOD SAFETY AUDITING: ADDRESSING AUDITOR CONFLICT
   OF INTEREST}},
Journal = {{WISCONSIN LAW REVIEW}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{289-335}},
Abstract = {{Private auditing is a significant component of food safety regulation.
   Typically, manufacturers, retail sellers, and food-service operators
   require their suppliers to obtain food safety certification from a
   private third-party auditor paid by the supplier. Auditors' financial
   interest in acquiring accounts from suppliers who want the cheapest
   certification that they can obtain gives auditors incentive to reduce
   the rigor of audits. This constitutes a conflict of interest between the
   auditor's private financial interest and its professional obligation to
   protect the public from food safety risks. Audit industry insiders and
   outside observers are well aware of this problem, and various
   institutional actors both public and private have developed oversight
   mechanisms to address it.
   We analyze the nature and sources of this conflict of interest in food
   safety auditing, efforts to prevent it, and responses when it occurs.
   Our focus is on institutional design organizational structures,
   administrative routines, and professional norms. Part I of the Article
   describes how conflicts of interest lead some auditors to be less
   probing in their inspection of suppliers' operations and to skew their
   risk evaluations in favor of suppliers' desire for cheap certification.
   Part II of the Article surveys the different oversight mechanisms
   currently in place or under development that aim to counteract auditors'
   incentive to reduce the rigor of audits.
   Conflict of interest is a structural feature of any system of private
   standards compliance in which the auditor is paid by the entity being
   audited. Other prominent examples include securities rating and
   environmental audits. Our analysis of food safety auditing aims to offer
   general insights into the comparative strengths and weaknesses of
   different responses to this problem.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANPOWER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1016-1037}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study the re-entry to the
   workforce of fully retired persons (unretirement) and whether the
   decision to resume work depends primarily on social or economic reasons.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using Swedish register data for already
   retired individuals older than 55, the incidence of unretirement is
   studied. Determinant factors behind the decision to re-enter the labor
   force is analyzed in a binary response logit model.
   Findings - Unretirement varies between 6 and 14 percent under two
   different definitions. We find support for higher pension income to
   decrease the probability to unretire. Other determinants, such as
   marital status, largely support an interpretation that unretirement is a
   life-style decision rather than a response to an experienced negative
   economic situation post retirement.
   Research limitations/implications - Due to data limitations, the focus
   in this study is on the extensive margin (the event of returning to the
   labor force) and not on hours of work post re-entry.
   Social implications - If older persons that are physically able to work
   also want to work and succeed in finding work when they demand so,
   unretirement is welfare enhancing. However, if unretirement is an effect
   of unexpected realizations post retirement, any increase in the number
   of persons facing such unexpected shocks implies an increase in the
   uncertainty of life as retired.
   Originality/value - Research on unretirement is scarce and has
   previously been performed exclusively on US survey data. Knowing the
   determinants of unretirement is important to know if and how incentives
   to unretire should be designed.}},

Title = {{Are ACOs Ready to be Accountable for Medication Use?}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MANAGED CARE PHARMACY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{17+}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Accountable care organizations (ACOs) have the potential to
   lower costs and improve quality through incentives and coordinated care.
   However, the design brings with it many new challenges. One such
   challenge is the optimal use of pharmaceuticals. Most ACOs have not yet
   focused on this integral facet of care, even though medications are a
   critical component to achieving the lower costs and Improved quality
   that are anticipated with this new model.
   OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether ACOs are prepared to maximize the value
   of medications for achieving quality benchmarks and cost offsets.
   METHODS: During the fall of 2012, an electronic readiness
   self-assessment was developed using a portion of the questions and
   question methodology from the National Survey of Accountable Care
   Organizations, along with original questions developed by the authors.
   The assessment was tested and subsequently revised based on feedback
   from pilot testing with 5 ACO representatives. The revised assessment
   was distributed via e-mail to a convenience sample (n=175) of ACO
   members of the American Medical Group Association, Brookings-Dartmouth
   ACO Learning Network, and Premier Healthcare Alliance.
   RESULTS: The self-assessment was completed by 46 ACO representatives
   (26\% response rate). ACOs reported high readiness to manage medications
   In a few areas, such as transmitting prescriptions electronically
   (70\%), being able to integrate medical and pharmacy data into a single
   database (54\%), and having a formulary in place that encourages generic
   use when appropriate (50\%). However, many areas have substantial room
   for improvement with few ACOs reporting high readiness. Some notable
   areas include being able to quantify the cost offsets and hence
   demonstrate the value of appropriate medication use (7\%), notifying a
   physician when a prescription has been filled (9\%), having protocols in
   place to avoid medication duplication and polypharmacy (17\%), and
   having quality metrics in place for a broad diversity of conditions
   (22\%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Developing the capabilities to support, monitor, and ensure
   appropriate medication use will be critical to achieve optimal patient
   outcomes and ACO success. The ACOs surveyed have embarked upon an
   important journey towards this goal, but critical gaps remain before
   they can become fully accountable. While many of these organizations
   have begun adopting health information technologies that allow them to
   maximize the value of medications for achieving quality outcomes and
   cost offsets, a significant lag was identified in their inability to use
   these technologies to their full capacities. In order to provide further
   guidance, the authors have begun documenting case studies for public
   release that would provide ACOs with examples of how certain medication
   issues have been addressed by ACOs or relevant organizations. The
   authors hope that these case studies will help ACOs optimize the value
   of pharmaceuticals and achieve the ``triple aim{''} of improving care,
   health, and cost. Copyright (C) 2014, Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy.

   quality improvement and instead believed they were developed for
   purposes of cost reduction. Relatively few NHAs believed that P4P would

Journal = {{BMJ OPEN}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Objective To quantify the effect of strategies to improve retention in
   randomised trials.
   Design Systematic review and meta-analysis.
   Data sources Sources searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, DARE, CENTRAL,
   CINAHL, C2-SPECTR, ERIC, PreMEDLINE, Cochrane Methodology Register,
   Current Controlled Trials metaRegister, WHO trials platform, Society for
   Clinical Trials (SCT) conference proceedings and a survey of all UK
   clinical trial research units.
   Review methods Included trials were randomised evaluations of strategies
   to improve retention embedded within host randomised trials. The primary
   outcome was retention of trial participants. Data from trials were
   pooled using the fixed-effect model. Subgroup analyses were used to
   explore the heterogeneity and to determine whether there were any
   differences in effect by the type of strategy.
   Results 38 retention trials were identified. Six broad types of
   strategies were evaluated. Strategies that increased postal
   questionnaire responses were: adding, that is, giving a monetary
   incentive (RR 1.18; 95\% CI 1.09 to 1.28) and higher valued incentives
   (RR 1.12; 95\% CI 1.04 to 1.22). Offering a monetary incentive, that is,
   an incentive given on receipt of a completed questionnaire, also
   increased electronic questionnaire response (RR 1.25; 95\% CI 1.14 to
   1.38). The evidence for shorter questionnaires (RR 1.04; 95\% CI 1.00 to
   1.08) and questionnaires relevant to the disease/condition (RR 1.07;
   95\% CI 1.01 to 1.14) is less clear. On the basis of the results of
   single trials, the following strategies appeared effective at increasing
   questionnaire response: recorded delivery of questionnaires (RR 2.08;
   95\% CI 1.11 to 3.87); a package' of postal communication strategies (RR
   1.43; 95\% CI 1.22 to 1.67) and an open trial design (RR 1.37; 95\% CI
   1.16 to 1.63). There is no good evidence that the following strategies
   impact on trial response/retention: adding a non-monetary incentive
   (RR=1.00; 95\% CI 0.98 to 1.02); offering a non-monetary incentive
   (RR=0.99; 95\% CI 0.95 to 1.03); enhanced' letters (RR=1.01; 95\% CI
   0.97 to 1.05); monetary incentives compared with offering prize draw
   entry (RR=1.04; 95\% CI 0.91 to 1.19); priority postal delivery
   (RR=1.02; 95\% CI 0.95 to 1.09); behavioural motivational strategies
   (RR=1.08; 95\% CI 0.93 to 1.24); additional reminders to participants
   (RR=1.03; 95\% CI 0.99 to 1.06) and questionnaire question order
   (RR=1.00, 0.97 to 1.02). Also based on single trials, these strategies
   do not appear effective: a telephone survey compared with a monetary
   incentive plus questionnaire (RR=1.08; 95\% CI 0.94 to 1.24); offering a
   charity donation (RR=1.02, 95\% CI 0.78 to 1.32); sending sites
   reminders (RR=0.96; 95\% CI 0.83 to 1.11); sending questionnaires early
   (RR=1.10; 95\% CI 0.96 to 1.26); longer and clearer questionnaires
   (RR=1.01, 0.95 to 1.07) and participant case management by trial
   assistants (RR=1.00; 95\% CI 0.97 to 1.04).
   Conclusions Most of the trials evaluated questionnaire response rather
   than ways to improve participants return to site for follow-up. Monetary
   incentives and offers of monetary incentives increase postal and
   electronic questionnaire response. Some strategies need further
   evaluation. Application of these results would depend on trial context
   and follow-up procedures.}},

Journal = {{GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{24}},
Pages = {{334-348}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In response to substantial deforestation over many decades, large scale
   reforestation programs are being implemented across many tropical
   developing countries. Examples include the United Nations Billion Trees
   Campaign, the National Greening Program in the Philippines, and the 5
   million ha reforestation program in Vietnam. However, while substantial
   investments are being made in reforestation, little information exists
   on the drivers influencing reforestation success and how these interact
   to determine environmental and socio-economic outcomes. In this study we
   surveyed 43 reforestation projects on Leyte Island, The Philippines to
   identify the drivers that most influence reforestation success as
   measured by key indicators drawn from the literature, including
   interactions between drivers and between drivers and indicators. We
   investigated 98 potential success drivers, including technical and
   biophysical factors; socio-economic factors; institutional, policy and
   management factors; and reforestation project characteristics. We also
   measured 12 success indicators, including forest establishment, forest
   growth, environmental and socio-economic success indicators. Stepwise
   multiple regressions were used to identify significant relationships
   among drivers and indicators and this analysis was used to develop a
   system of driver and indicator relationships. Based on this we found
   that revegetation method, funding source, education and awareness
   campaigns, the dependence of local people on forests, reforestation
   incentives, project objectives, forest protection mechanisms and the
   condition of road infrastructure were highly connected drivers that
   influenced multiple success indicators either directly or indirectly. We
   conclude that policies targeting revegetation methods, socioeconomic
   incentives, forest protection mechanisms, sustainable livelihoods,
   diversification of funding and partnerships, technical support, and
   infrastructure development are likely to have a broad systemic and
   beneficial effect on the success of reforestation programs in tropical
   developing countries. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Survey concerning electronic textbooks Assessing student behavior and
   environmental considerations}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{142-156}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - A survey of students in different undergraduate majors and
   years asked where they bought their textbooks, the types of electronic
   devices they used, and their post-class use of textbook material. The
   research goal was to determine the groups of students likely most
   receptive to e-textbooks and to assess the potential environmental
   benefits of e-textbook adoption. The paper aims to discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - The student population of freshmen and
   juniors registered at Michigan State University were surveyed via
   e-mail/online in summer 2010. 477 freshmen (7.8 percent of surveyed) and
   652 juniors (10.2 percent of surveyed) responded. Responses were grouped
   together into seven categories by student major.
   Findings - Surveyed students used far more print textbooks than
   e-textbooks. Laptops were the dominant student device and their future
   promise for e-textbook use is limited. The higher-than-expected rate of
   e-waste generation by students indicates that the environmental benefits
   of e-textbook adoption may be limited without improvements in e-waste
   management. However, results suggest that students from all majors and
   years were willing to experiment with different textbook vendors, so if
   functionality and cost incentives are improved, e-textbook adoption will
   likely be a widespread campus phenomenon.
   Originality/value - Research on e-textbooks often focuses on educational
   value or student preference; this research instead provides results
   assessing whether current e-device use on campus will support
   e-textbooks and whether adopting e-textbooks will have an environmental
   benefit over print textbooks. The study also reveals that many students
   learn to adapt their purchasing behavior with experience, and that this
   trend is widespread throughout all majors.}},

   PCPs' practices for providing this care.
   Design. The study design was a nationally representative survey
   conducted in 2008.
   Setting. The study setting was U. S. primary care practices.
   Subjects. A total of 1740 PCPs completed two sequential questionnaires
   (response rate, 55.5\%).
   Measures. The study measured PCPs' reports of practice resources, and
   the frequency of body mass index assessment, counseling, referral for
   further evaluation/management, and monitoring of patients for energy
   balance care.
   Analysis. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression modeling were
   used.
   Results. More than 80\% of PCPs reported having information resources on
   diet, physical activity, or weight control available in waiting/exam
   rooms, but fewer billed (45\%), used reminder systems (, 30\%), or
   received incentive payments (3\%) for energy balance care. A total of
   26\% reported regularly assessing body mass index and always/often
   providing counseling as well as tracking patients for progress related
   to energy balance. In multivariate analyses, PCPs in practices with full
   electronic health records or those that bill for energy balance care
   provided this care more often and more comprehensively. There were
   strong specialty differences, with pediatricians more likely (odds
   ratio, 1.78; 95\% confidence interval, 1.262.51) and
   obstetrician/gynecologists less likely (odds ratio, 0.28; 95\%
   confidence interval, 0.17-0.44) than others to provide energy balance
   care.
   nce care. Further research is needed to understand PCP care-related
   specialty differences.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The importance of tobacco tax structure in determining the
   relative prices of different tobacco products and brands has become
   increasingly recognized. The structuring of tobacco tax across products
   and brands within a country can impact the variability of prices within
   a country, shaping consumption and influencing tobacco users' incentives
   to switch down to cheaper alternatives in response to tax and price
   increases.
   Methods: Brand-specific data on the average prices paid for the top 5
   cigarette brands in 13 countries were obtained from the Global Adult
   Tobacco Survey, and for the United States, data were obtained from the
   National Adult Tobacco Survey. The variability of cigarette prices paid
   across brands was analyzed in the context of each country's tobacco tax
   structure.
   Results: Countries with simpler cigarette tax structures, particularly
   those that emphasize specific taxes and do not involve tier-based taxes,
   exhibit less variability in the prices smokers pay for cigarettes across
   brands.
   Conclusions: Increases in cigarette taxes in countries with simpler tax
   structures will be more effective in reducing cigarette smoking and its
   health and economic consequences than comparable tax increases in
   countries where tax structures are more complicated and there are
   greater opportunities for switching to cheaper brands in order to avoid
   a tax increase.}},

Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{6, SI}},
Pages = {{1752-1760}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers how farmers perceive and respond to climate change
   policy risks, and suggests that understanding these risk responses is as
   important as understanding responses to biophysical climate change
   impacts. Based on a survey of 162 farmers in California, we test three
   hypotheses regarding climate policy risk: (1) that perceived climate
   change risks will have a direct impact on farmer's responses to climate
   policy risks, (2) that previous climate change experiences will
   influence farmer's climate change perceptions and climate policy risk
   responses, and (3) that past experiences with environmental policies
   will more strongly affect a farmer's climate change beliefs, risks, and
   climate policy risk responses. Using a structural equation model we find
   support for all three hypotheses and furthermore show that farmers'
   negative past policy experiences do not make them less likely to respond
   to climate policy risks through participation in a government incentive
   program. We discuss how future research and climate policies can be
   structured to garner greater agricultural participation. This work
   highlights that understanding climate policy risk responses and other
   social, economic and policy perspectives is a vital component of
   understanding climate change beliefs, risks and behaviors and should be
   more thoroughly considered in future work. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In response to the decline of northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus;
   hereafter, bobwhite) in eastern Oklahoma, USA, a cost-share incentive
   program for private landowners was initiated to restore early
   successional habitat. Our objectives were to determine whether the
   program had an effect on bobwhite occupancy in the restoration areas and
   evaluate how local-and landscape-level habitat characteristics affect
   occupancy in both restoration and control areas. We surveyed 14 sample
   units that received treatment between 2009 and 2011, and 17 sample units
   that were controls. We used single-season occupancy models, with year as
   a dummy variable, to test for an effect of restoration treatment and
   habitat variables on occupancy. We found no significant treatment
   effect. Model selection showed that occupancy was best explained by the
   combination of overstory canopy cover and habitat area at both the local
   and landscape scales. Moran's I revealed positive spatial
   autocorrelation in the 1,000-3,000-m distance band, indicating that the
   likelihood of bobwhite occupancy increased with proximity to other
   populations. We show that creating >= 20 ha of habitat within 1-3 km of
   existing bobwhite populations increases the chance of restoration being
   successful. Published 2013. This article is a U.S. Government work and

Abstract = {{Objective: Very little is known about predictors of response rates to
   long-term follow-up mail-out surveys, including whether the timing of an
   incentive affects response rates. We aimed to determine whether the
   timing of the incentive affects response rates and what baseline
   demographic and psychological factors predict response rates to a 12
   year follow-up survey.
   Study design and setting: Participants were 450 randomly selected people
   from the Penrith population, Australia who had previously participated
   in a mail-out survey 12 years earlier. By random allocation, 150 people
   received no incentive, 150 received a lottery ticket inducement with the
   follow-up survey and 150 received a lottery ticket inducement on the
   return of a completed survey.
   Results: The overall response rate for the study was 63\%. There were no
   significant differences in terms of response rates between the no
   incentive (58.8\%; 95\% CI 49.8\%, 67.3\%), incentive with survey
   (65.1\%; 95\% CI 56.2\%, 73.3\%) and promised incentive (65.3\%; 95\% CI

   being less neurotic as reported on the first survey 12 years earlier

Abstract = {{This paper examines the role of Australian hot water system rebate
   programs in shifting the existing stock of electric water heaters toward
   more climate friendly versions using two unique data sets from New South
   Wales homeowners. The first data set is based on a survey of households

   programs were in place. The other is based on a set of stated preference
   questions asked of households soon to face a replacement decision. While
   the former allows us to look at recent responses, the latter enables us
   to forecast future demand. We find that the programs significantly
   increase shares of solar/heat pump systems. The programs, however,
   appear less effective in reducing the stock of electric heaters for
   households with access to natural gas. This pattern is consistent in
   both datasets. Results from the discrete choice experiments suggest
   considerable heterogeneity with respect to household preferences toward
   different types of water heaters and the discount rates they hold. The
   effective cost of reducing carbon emissions via incentives for water
   heater replacement is considered from the counterfactual perspective of
   no government incentives. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Women represent a growing proportion of the physician workforce,
   worldwide. Therefore, for the purposes of workforce planning, it is
   increasingly important to understand differences in how male and female
   physicians work and might respond to financial incentives. A recent
   survey allowed us to determine whether sex-based differences in either
   physician income or responses to a hypothetical increase in
   reimbursement exist among French General Practitioners (GPs). Our
   analysis of 828 male and 244 female GPs' responses showed that females
   earned 35\% less per year from medical practice than their male
   counterparts. After adjusting for the fact that female GPs had practiced
   medicine fewer years, worked 11\% fewer hours per year, and spent more
   time with each consultation, female GPs earned 11,194(sic), or 20.6\%,
   less per year (95\% CI: 7085(sic)-15,302(sic) less per year). Male GPs
   were more likely than female GPs to indicate that they would work fewer
   hours if consultation fees were to be increased. Our findings suggest
   that, as the feminization of medicine increases, the need to address
   gender-based income disparities increases and the tools that French
   policymakers use to regulate the physician supply might need to change.

   Study Design: Survey of physicians.
   Methods: A survey was administered to 140 lead clinicians at each
   participating practice. Survey domains included clinicians' experiences
   and attitudes toward the selected clinical quality measures focused on
   cardiovascular care, use of electronic health records (EHRs), technical
   assistance visits, quality measurement reports, and incentive payments.
   Responses were compared across groups of practices receiving financial
   incentives with those in the control (no financial rewards).
   Results: Survey response rate was 74\%. The majority of respondents
   reported receiving and reviewing the quality reports (89\%), agreed with
   the prioritization of measures (89\%), and understood the information
   given in the quality reports (95\%). Over half of the respondents had a

Abstract = {{The meetings, incentives, conventions, and exhibitions (MICE) industry
   has evolved into a vital sector of business tourism. The vast majority
   of research to date has focused on the convention/meeting sector, with
   studies on convention site selection being especially prominent. In
   contrast, the exhibition sector and particularly, exhibition destination
   attractiveness, have received relatively little research attention. This
   study aims to address this research gap by examining, from the
   exhibitors' perspective, key factors for an attractive and successful
   exhibition destination. Based on 616 survey responses from exhibitors
   collected at nine trade fairs in four cities in Mainland China, study
   findings highlighted the critical importance of two types of cluster
   effectshost city leadership in the industry and host city/region as a
   source of exhibitorsto an exhibition destination's attractiveness for
   exhibitors. Accessibility, venue facilities, and the destination's
   leisure and economic environment were considered less important.
   Implications of the study results are discussed and directions for
   future research provided.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how institutional incentives and mechanisms for assigning
   recognition shape access to a permanent job is important. This study,
   based on data from questionnaire survey responses and publications of
   1,257 university science, biomedical and engineering faculty in Spain,
   attempts to understand the timing of getting a permanent position and
   the relevant factors that account for this transition, in the context of
   dilemmas between mobility and permanence faced by organizations. Using
   event history analysis, the paper looks at the time to promotion and the
   effects of some relevant covariates associated to academic performance,
   social embeddedness and mobility. We find that research productivity
   contributes to career acceleration, but that other variables are also
   significantly associated to a faster transition. Factors associated to
   the social elements of academic life also play a role in reducing the
   time from PhD graduation to tenure. However, mobility significantly
   increases the duration of the non-tenure stage. In contrast with
   previous findings, the role of sex is minor. The variations in the
   length of time to promotion across different scientific domains is
   confirmed, with faster career advancement for those in the Engineering
   and Technological Sciences compared with academics in the Biological and
   Biomedical Sciences. Results show clear effects of seniority, and
   rewards to loyalty, in addition to some measurements of performance and
   quality of the university granting the PhD, as key elements speeding up
   career advancement. Findings suggest the existence of a system based on
   granting early permanent jobs to those that combine social embeddedness
   and team integration with some good credentials regarding past and
   potential future performance, rather than high levels of mobility.}},

Title = {{Assessing health workers' revenues and coping strategies in Nigeria - a
   mixed-methods study}},
Journal = {{BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{OCT 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: The setting of realistic performance-based financing rewards
   necessitates not just knowledge of health workers' salaries, but of the
   revenue that accrues from their additional income-generating activities.
   This study examined the coping mechanisms of health workers in the
   public health sector of Nasarawa and Ondo states in Nigeria to
   supplement their salaries and benefits; it also estimated the
   proportionate value of the revenues from those coping mechanisms in
   relation to the health workers' official incomes.
   Methods: This study adopted a mixed-methods approach, consisting of
   semi-structured interviews, a review of policy documents, a survey using
   self-administered questionnaires, and the randomized response technique
   (RRT). In all, 170 health workers (86 in Ondo, 84 in Nasarawa)
   participated in the survey. In-depth interviews were conducted with 24
   health workers (12 per state) and nine policy makers from both states.
   Results: The health workers perceived their salaries as inadequate,
   though most policy makers differed in this assessment. There appeared to
   be a considerable expenditure-income disparity among the respondents.
   Approximately 56\% (n = 93) of the study population reported having
   additional earning arrangements: most reported non-medical activities
   such as farming and trading, but private practice was also frequently
   reported. Half of the respondents with additional earning arrangements
   stated that their income from those activities was the equivalent of
   half or more of their monthly salaries. Specifically, 35\% (n = 32) said
   that they earned about half of their official monthly salaries and 15\%
   (n = 14) reported earning the same or more than their monthly salaries
   from these activities. Other coping mechanisms used by the health
   workers included prioritizing activities that enabled the earning of per
   diems, collecting informal payments and gifts from patients, and
   pilfering drugs from facilities.
   Conclusions: Predatory and non-predatory mechanisms accounted for the
   health workers' additional income. It may be difficult for the health
   workers to meet their expenses with their salaries and financial
   incentives; this highlights the need for the regulation of additional
   earnings and to implement targeted accountability mechanisms. This study
   indicates the value of using mixed methods when investigating sensitive
   issues. Future studies of this type should employ mixed methods for
   triangulation purposes to provide better insight into health workers'
   responses.}},

Title = {{Improving job satisfaction of Chinese doctors: the positive effects of
   perceived organizational support and psychological capital}},
Journal = {{PUBLIC HEALTH}},

Volume = {{127}},
Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The huge population basic and the transformational changes
   to healthcare system in China have gained wide public attention in
   recent years. Along with these issues is a growing literature about
   doctor's job satisfaction; however, more is known about its negative
   related factors. Thus, this study was an attempt to assess the level of
   job satisfaction among Chinese doctors and to explore factors that
   enhance their job satisfaction.
   Study design: Cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted during the period of
   September/October 2010. A questionnaire containing job satisfaction
   assessed by Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ), demographic
   characteristics, work conditions, psychological capital (PsyCap) and
   perceived organizational support (POS) was distributed to 1300
   registered doctors in Liaoning province. A total of 984 respondents
   became our subjects (effective response rate 75.7\%). Hierarchical
   regression was performed to explore the factors associated with
   satisfaction.
   Results: The average MSQ score was 65.86 (level ranking for MSQ, 20-100)
   in our study population. Hierarchical regression analysis showed that
   POS (beta = 0.412, P < 0.001), PsyCap (beta = 0.255, P < 0.001),
   incentive system (beta = 0.119, P < 0.001) and educational background
   (beta = 0.056, P = 0.042) were positively associated with job
   satisfaction.
   Conclusions: The job satisfaction of Chinese doctors was at a moderate
   level. POS and PsyCap seemed to be the most crucial factors in relation
   to job satisfaction. Therefore, efficient measures such as building a
   supportive work environment and developing doctors' PsyCap should be
   considered by health administrators in order to promote job satisfaction
   among Chinese doctors. (C) 2013 The Royal Society for Public Health.

Title = {{Web-Based Survey to Assess the Perceptions of Managed Care Organization
   Representatives on Use of Copay Subsidy Coupons for Prescription Drugs}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MANAGED CARE PHARMACY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{602-608}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Promotion of prescription drug coupons and vouchers by
   pharmaceutical manufacturers has increased in recent years. These
   coupons and vouchers usually subsidize patients' cost-sharing
   obligations. in other words, drug companies pay for a patient's portion
   of the drug cost, and the remaining cost is paid by the patient and the
   patient's health plan. This practice is normally used for brand name
   drugs but can and has been used for generic drugs. Copayments (also
   known as copays), and especially high copays for higher cost drugs, are
   used by managed care organizations (MCOs) to place a higher financial
   burden on patients and also provide an appreciation of the medication
   cost. At the same time, tiered copay plans offer incentives, in the form
   of lower copays, to use available equivalent generic alternatives or
   lower cost brand name drugs, instead of high cost brand name drugs. With
   higher tiered copays for brand name drugs being offset by coupons,
   little is known about MCO representatives' perceptions about the use of
   copay subsidy coupons for brand name prescription drugs.
   OBJECTIVE: To assess health plan managers' and pharmacy benefit
   managers' (PBMs) perceptions about the use of prescription drug copay
   subsidy coupons.
   METHODS: A 28-item online survey instrument was used to collect data
   from health plan and PBM representatives. A sample of 834 MCO
   representatives was selected from the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy
   membership directory. Pharmacists, managers, directors, and executive
   officers working in pharmacy, formulary, and clinical pharmacy
   operations were selected for the survey. Respondents from non-MCO
   settings and government-sponsored health plans were excluded from the
   survey.
   RESULTS: A total of 122 surveys were returned after 3 emails (i.e., an
   invitation and 2 reminder emails) of which 105 were usable surveys,
   giving a response rate of 13.7\%. A 5-point, 11-item Likert scale (1 =
   Strongly Disagree and 5 = Strongly Agree) was used to measure
   respondents' perceptions toward prescription drug coupons. Some items
   referred to coupons used repeatedly over a year to get copay discounts
   (i.e., long-term use coupons) whereas some items referred to coupons
   distributed for trial purposes (i.e., short-term use coupons). Of the
   105 respondents, 100 (95.2\%) agreed that copay subsidy coupons
   encouraged nonpreferred brand name drugs over preferred brand name
   drugs. A total of 102 (97.2\%) respondents agreed that brand name drug
   coupons undermined tiered formulary structure. Ninety-two (87.6\%)
   respondents agreed that short-term use coupons increased plan sponsor's
   costs while 96 (91.5\%) respondents agreed that sponsor cost increased
   with long-term use coupons. A total of 68 (64.8\%) agreed that
   short-term use coupons should be eliminated whereas 78 (74.3\%)
   respondents agreed that long-term use coupons should be eliminated.
   CONCLUSION: Among MCOs' many business activities are efforts to contain
   rising pharmacy costs. The results of this survey indicate that MCO
   representatives believe that incentive programs such as prescription
   drug coupons and vouchers lead to an increase in brand name drug
   utilization, which undermines their formulary controls and, in turn, can
   be expected to increase overall health care costs. Copyright (c) 2013,

Title = {{Faecal incontinence in rural and regional northern Queensland
   community-dwelling adults}},
Journal = {{RURAL AND REMOTE HEALTH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: In Australia, faecal incontinence, the involuntary loss of
   liquid or solid stool with or without a person's awareness, has been
   reported in 8\% of the South Australian and 11\% of the urban New South
   Wales community-dwelling populations. Studies conducted in 2004 and 2005
   reported faecal incontinence in more than 20\% of colorectal and
   urogynaecological clinic patients at Townsville Hospital (a referral
   centre serving rural North Queensland). This prompted concern regarding
   the level of faecal incontinence in the community. The aim of this study
   was to investigate the prevalence of faecal incontinence in the North
   and Far North Queensland urban and rural communities.
   Methods: The sample size was based on the New South Wales postal surveys
   (11\% prevalence). Higher rates were expected in North/Far North
   Queensland, so prevalence there was estimated at 12.1\% (confidence
   interval +/- 2\%, ie the true level to be between 10.1\% and 14.1\%).
   The sample for each of the Townsville, Cairns (in Far North Queensland)
   and rural/remote settings was calculated at 1022. The database for the
   present study was compiled using a systematic randomised process
   selecting two private names from each column on each page of the Cairns
   and Townsville White Pages (R) (Cairns: 1112 urban, 481 rural, 226
   remote; Townsville: 1049 urban, 432 rural, 320 remote). The
   questionnaire covered personal demographics, health/risk factors, bowel
   habits, nutrition (fibre and fluid intake) and physical activity. Faecal
   incontinence was defined as accidental leakage of solid or liquid stool
   in the past 12 months that was not caused by a virus, medication or
   contaminated food. To improve the response rate a participation
   incentive of a chance to win a \$250 voucher or one of ten \$50 vouchers
   was offered in the initial mail-out. The initial survey was mailed out
   in July 2007; two follow-up surveys were mailed out to non-responders in
   September 2007 and January 2008. One hundred randomly selected
   non-responders were telephoned in February 2008.
   Results: A total of 1523 responses provided a 48.1\% response rate.
   Faecal incontinence prevalence was 12.7\% (174/1366) with no gender or
   locality differences. Prevalence increased significantly with age in men
   (p=0.034), but not in women. Only 10 respondents with faecal
   incontinence consulted their doctor in the previous year for this
   reason. Incontinent respondents had significantly more medical
   conditions including urinary incontinence, coeliac disease, irritable
   bowel syndrome, injury to the anus, bowel cancer, spinal cord disease,
   neurological disease and psychiatric problems (all, p<0.05).
   Stool-related accidental bowel leakage including faecal incontinence
   (defined), soiling with flatus or urgency, was 18.2\%. An additional 3\%
   were possibly incontinent, having disclosed leakage of mucus, bothersome
   or passive staining. Of the remaining respondents, 16.2\% reported
   incontinent episodes due to an acute illness, 22.9\% could not always
   differentiate between flatus and stool, and only 35.2\% reported neither
   concerns with nor accidental bowel leakage.
   Conclusions: There is a high level of untreated faecal incontinence in
   North/Far North Queensland communities. Demand for treatment will
   increase because of the ageing population and the expectations of
   younger, more assertive cohorts.}},

   outcomes were reductions in symptoms or improved coping, improved
   relationships, and enhanced community participation. Other reported
   outcomes included reduced hospitalization or use of state-funded mental

Title = {{A national study on nurses' retention in healthcare facilities in
   underserved areas in Lebanon}},
Journal = {{HUMAN RESOURCES FOR HEALTH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{SEP 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Nursing shortages and maldistribution are priority issues
   for healthcare systems around the globe. Such imbalances are often
   aggravated in underserved areas, especially in developing countries.
   Despite the centrality of this issue, there is a dearth of studies that
   examine the retention of nurses in underserved areas in the Middle East
   Region. This study investigates the characteristic and the factors
   associated with the retention of nurses working in rural areas in
   Lebanon.
   Methods: This study uses a non-experimental cross-sectional design to
   survey nurses working in underserved areas of Lebanon. Underserved areas
   in Lebanon were identified using WHO definition. A total of 103 health
   facilities (hospitals and primary healthcare centers) located in these
   areas were identified and all nurses working at these facilities
   received a copy of the survey questionnaire. The questionnaire included
   five sections: demographic, work-life, career plan, job satisfaction,
   and assessment of work environment. Analysis included univariate and
   bivariate (chi-square, Student's t-test and ANOVA) tests to describe the
   respondents and examine the significance between nurses' characteristics
   and their intent to stay. A logistic regression model was constructed to
   identify factors associated with nurses' intent to stay in underserved
   areas.
   Results: A total of 857 nurses from 63 Primary Healthcare (PHC) centers
   and hospitals responded to the questionnaire (75.5\% response rate).
   Only 35.1\% of nurses indicated their intent to stay in their current
   job over the coming one to three years. Surveyed nurses were most
   satisfied with relationship with co-workers and least satisfied with
   extrinsic rewards. Rural nurses working in PHC centers were more
   satisfied than their hospital counterparts on all aspects of work and
   had significantly higher intention to stay (62.5\% compared to 31.5\% in
   hospitals, P < 0.001). Regression analysis revealed that nurses less
   likely to report intent to stay were younger, unmarried, with less years
   of work experience and were not working towards a higher degree.
   Analysis reveals a directly proportional relationship between nurses'
   reported job satisfaction and their intent to stay.
   Conclusion: This study reveals poor retention of nurses in rural and
   underserved areas in Lebanon, especially in the hospital sector. The
   status quo is disquieting as it reflects an unstable and dissatisfied
   nursing workforce. Developing targeted retention strategies for younger
   nurses and those working in hospitals as well as the offering of
   professional development opportunities and devising an incentive scheme
   targeting rural nurses is pivotal to enhance nurses' job satisfaction
   and retention in rural settings.}},

Title = {{Characteristic profiles among students and junior doctors with specific
   career preferences}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{SEP 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: Factors influencing specialty choice have been studied in an
   attempt to find incentives to enhance the workforce in certain
   specialties. The notion of ``controllable lifestyle (CL)
   specialties,{''} defined by work hours and income, is gaining in
   popularity. As a result, many reports advocate providing a
   `lifestyle-friendly' work environment to attract medical graduates.
   However, little has been documented about the priority in choosing
   specialties across the diverse career opportunities. This nationwide
   study was conducted in Japan with the aim of identifying factors that
   influence specialty choice. It looked for characteristic profiles among
   senior students and junior doctors who were choosing between different
   specialties.
   Methods: We conducted a survey of 4th and 6th (final)-year medical
   students and foundation year doctors, using a questionnaire enquiring
   about their specialty preference and to what extent their decision was
   influenced by a set of given criteria. The results were subjected to a
   factor analysis. After identifying factors, we analysed a subset of
   responses from 6th year students and junior doctors who identified a
   single specialty as their future career, to calculate a z-score
   (standard score) of each factor and then we plotted the scores on a
   cobweb chart to visualise characteristic profiles.
   Results: Factor analysis yielded 5 factors that influence career
   preference. Fifteen specialties were sorted into 4 groups based on the
   factor with the highest z-score: ``fulfilling life with job security{''}
   (radiology, ophthalmology, anaesthesiology, dermatology and psychiatry),
   ``bioscientific orientation{''} (internal medicine subspecialties,
   surgery, obstetrics and gynaecology, emergency medicine, urology, and
   neurosurgery), and ``personal reasons{''} (paediatrics and
   orthopaedics). Two other factors were ``advice from others{''} and
   ``educational experience{''}. General medicine / family medicine and
   otolaryngology were categorized as ``intermediate{''} group because of
   similar degree of influence from 5 factors.
   Conclusion: What is valued in deciding a career varies between
   specialties. Emphasis on lifestyle issues, albeit important, might
   dissuade students and junior doctors who are more interested in
   bioscientific aspects of the specialty or have strong personal reasons
   to pursue the career choice. In order to secure balanced workforce
   across the specialties, enrolling students with varied background and
   beliefs should be considered in the student selection process.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Poor response rates can jeopardise the validity of the
   findings of epidemiological surveys. The aim of this study was to
   undertake a randomised controlled trial to determine the effectiveness
   of different strategies for maximizing parental consent rates for dental
   health surveys of young children.
   Methods: The trial took place within the 2007/2008 NHS Epidemiological
   Dental Health Survey of 5-year-old children in the North West of
   England. Schools were randomised to one of five interventions: multiple
   letters to parents; promoting the research by providing additional
   information to parents and children; a financial incentive to the
   school; a financial incentive to the school administrator plus direct
   mailing to parents; and a control intervention comprising of usual
   practice, that is a single letter home to parents via the children.
   Results: A total of 335 schools (11,088 children) were recruited. The
   mean percentage consent rates ranged from 47\% (financial incentive to
   school administrator plus direct mailing) to 63\% (multiple letters).
   Pair-wise comparisons indicated that the multiple letter group had a
   statistically significantly greater consent rate than the financial
   incentive to the school administrator plus direct mailing group and
   promoting the research by providing additional information group, but
   was not statistically significantly different from the financial
   incentive to the school group and the control group.
   Conclusions: There was little evidence to show that any of the five
   interventions made a significant difference to consent rates when
   compared to the control group. Financial incentives to schools were less
   effective than multiple reminder letters to parents. Trials should be
   built into surveys to test different interventions, in different
   contexts to expand the evidence base for improving consent rates in
   health surveillance programmes.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying efficient and effective ways of tailoring survey designs is
   critical in the face of decreasing response rates, increasing
   differential nonresponse, and rising survey costs. Utilizing auxiliary
   information appended to an initial sample frame allows researchers both
   to drive differential or tailored treatments across the sample and to
   enrich back-end analyses, including a simple and efficient form of
   nonresponse assessment. In this study, we leverage variables appended to
   an address-based sample (ABS) design to (1) target different levels of
   incentives to some of the traditionally hardest-to-reach groups (e.g.,
   younger adults, Blacks, and Hispanics) and (2) examine the potential for
   bias in the survey results by comparing respondents and nonrespondents
   across an array of key sample frame variables. Using data from a
   national ABS sample of 4,000 addresses, the study demonstrates that
   differential nonresponse is a problem with particular sets of addresses
   on the ABS frame (those with no telephone match), and although use of a
   mail survey combined with targeted incentives seems to reduce this
   effect, there is no single incentive structure-survey mode combination
   that works well across the three hardest-to-reach groups. The approach
   also allows researchers to assess the potential for nonresponse bias
   before determining if more extensive (and expensive) nonresponse
   follow-up methodologies need to be employed.}},

Abstract = {{Surveys involving health care providers are characterized by low and

   strategies to increase survey RRs among health professionals. Based on
   48 studies with 156 subgroups of within-study conditions, a multilevel
   meta-regression analysis was conducted to summarize the effects of
   different strategies employed in surveys of health professionals. An
   estimated overall survey RR among health professionals was 0.53 with a
   significant downward trend during the last half century. Of the
   variables that were examined, mode of data collection, incentives, and
   number of follow-up attempts were all found to be significantly related
   to RR. The mail survey mode was more effective in improving RR, compared
   to the online or web survey mode. Relative to the non-incentive
   subgroups, subgroups receiving monetary incentives were more likely to
   respond, while nonmonetary incentive groups were not significantly
   different from non-incentive groups. When number of follow-ups was
   considered, the one or two attempts of follow-up were found to be

Abstract = {{Background: Survey response rates have been declining over the past
   decade. The more widespread use of the Internet and Web-based
   technologies among potential health survey participants suggests that
   Web-based questionnaires may be an alternative to paper questionnaires
   in future epidemiological studies.
   Objective: To compare response rates in a population of parents by using
   4 different modes of data collection for a questionnaire survey of which
   1 involved a nonmonetary incentive.
   Methods: A random sample of 3148 parents of Danish children aged 2-17
   years were invited to participate in the Danish part of the NordChild
   2011 survey on their children's health and welfare. NordChild was
   conducted in 1984 and 1996 in collaboration with Finland, Iceland,
   Norway, and Sweden using mailed paper questionnaires only. In 2011, all
   countries used conventional paper versions only except Denmark where the
   parents were randomized into 4 groups: (1) 789 received a paper
   questionnaire only (paper), (2) 786 received the paper questionnaire and
   a log-in code to the Web-based questionnaire (paper/Web), (3) 787
   received a log-in code to the Web-based questionnaire (Web), and (4) 786
   received log-in details to the Web-based questionnaire and were given an
   incentive consisting of a chance to win a tablet computer (Web/tablet).
   In connection with the first reminder, the nonresponders in the paper,
   paper/Web, and Web groups were also present with the opportunity to win
   a tablet computer as a means of motivation. Descriptive analysis was
   performed using chi-square tests. Odds ratios were used to estimate
   differences in response rates between the 4 modes.
   Results: In 2011, 1704 of 3148 (54.13\%) respondents answered the Danish
   questionnaire. The highest response rate was with the paper mode (n=443,
   56.2\%). The other groups had similar response rates: paper/Web (n=422,
   53.7\%), Web (n=420, 53.4\%), and Web/tablet (n=419, 53.3\%) modes.
   Compared to the paper mode, the odds for response rate in the paper/Web
   decreased by 9\% (OR 0.91, 95\% CI 0.74-1.10) and by 11\% (OR 0.89, 95\%
   CI 0.73-1.09) in the Web and Web/tablet modes. The total number of
   responders for NordChild declined from 10,291 of 15,339 (67.09\%) in
   1984 and 10,667 of 15,254 (69.93\%) in 1996 to 7805 of 15,945 (48.95\%)
   in 2011 with similar declines in all 5 Nordic countries.
   Conclusions: Web-based questionnaires could replace traditional paper
   questionnaires with minor effects on response rates and lower costs. The
   increasing effect on the response rate on participants replying for a
   nonmonetary incentive could only be estimated within the 2 Web-based
   questionnaire modes before the first reminder. Alternative platforms to
   reach higher participation rates in population surveys should reflect
   the development of electronic devices and the ways in which the
   population primarily accesses the Internet.}},

   Methods: An RCT was conducted within a general practice survey that
   investigated how to prolong working lives amongst ageing GPs in
   Australia. GPs (n = 125) were randomised to receive an attractive pen or
   no pen during their first invitation for participation in a survey. GPs
   could elect to complete the survey online or via mail. Two follow up
   reminders were sent without a pen to both groups. The main outcome
   measure was response rates.
   Results: The response rate for GPs who received a pen was higher in the
   intervention group (61.9\%) compared to the control group (46.8\%). This

Journal = {{IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JUL 19}},
Abstract = {{Background: The use of supply-side incentives to increase health service
   utilisation and enhance service quality is gaining momentum in many low-
   and middle-income countries. However, there is a paucity of evidence on
   the impact of such schemes, their cost-effectiveness, and the process of
   implementation and potential unintended consequences in these settings.
   A pay for performance (P4P) programme was introduced in Pwani region of
   Tanzania in 2011.
   Methods/design: An evaluation of the programme will be carried out to
   inform a potential national rollout. A controlled before and after study
   will examine the effect of the P4P programme on quality, coverage, and
   cost of targeted maternal and newborn healthcare services and selected
   non-targeted services at facilities in Tanzania. Data will be collected
   from a survey of 75 facilities, 750 patients exiting consultations, over
   75 health workers, and 1,500 households of women who delivered in the
   previous year, in all seven intervention districts. Data will be
   collected from the same number of respondents in four control districts.
   A process evaluation will examine: whether the P4P programme was
   implemented as planned; stakeholder response to the programme and its
   acceptability; and implementation bottlenecks and facilitating factors.
   Three rounds of process data collection will be conducted including a
   review of available P4P documents, individual interviews and focus group
   discussions with key informants working at facility and district level
   in five of the intervention districts, and at the regional and national
   levels. An economic evaluation will measure the cost-effectiveness of
   P4P relative to current practice from a societal perspective.
   Discussion: This evaluation will contribute robust evidence on the
   impact and cost-effectiveness of P4P in a low income setting, as well as
   generate a better understanding of the feasibility of integrating
   complex intervention packages like P4P within health systems in resource
   poor settings.}},

Abstract = {{While disclosure of HIV sero-status is encouraged in the management of

   Our findings are based on 12 in-depth interviews, 2 focus-group

   open-ended responses derived from 148 HIV-positive persons in a
   quantitative survey. The study was conducted in 2008-2009 in Kampala,

   children facing dilemmas in disclosure, whether it was parents revealing
   their own HIV status to their children or the status of their
   perinatally infected children, or young people infected through sexual
   intercourse telling their parents. For both groups, there is fear of
   blame, stigma, discrimination, and shame and guilt related to unsafe
   sex, while young people also fear loss of privileges. On the other hand,
   there are practical imperatives for disclosure in terms of gaining
   access to care, treatment, and material resources. Faced with these
   dilemmas, HIV-positive people and their families require professional
   counselling to help them work through the emotional challenges
   encountered and identify mechanisms of support and coping.}},

Abstract = {{Background. The American College of Surgeons/Association of Program
   Directors in Surgery (ACS/APDS) National Skills Curriculum is a 3-phase
   program targeting technical and nontechnical skills development. Few
   data exist regarding the adoption of this curriculum by surgical
   residencies. This study attempted to determine the rate of uptake and
   identify implementation enablers/barriers.
   Methods. A web-based survey was developed by an international expert
   panel of surgical educators (5 surgeons and 1 psychologist). After
   piloting, the survey was sent to all general surgery program directors
   via email link. Descriptive statistics were used to determine the
   residency program characteristics and perceptions of the curriculum.
   Implementation rates for each phase and module were calculated. Adoption
   barriers were identified quantitatively and qualitatively using free
   text responses. Standardized qualitative methodology of emergent theme
   analysis was used to identify strategies for success and details of
   support required for implementation.
   Results. Of the 238 program directors approached, 117(49\%) responded to
   the survey. Twenty-one percent (25/117) were unaware of the ACS/APDS
   curriculum. Implementation rates for were 36\% for phase I, 19\% for
   phase II, and 16\% for phase III. The most common modules adopted were
   the suturing knot-tying and chest tube modules of phase I. Over 50\% of
   respondents identified lack of faculty protected time, limited
   personnel, significant costs, and resident work-hour restrictions as
   major obstacles to implementation. Strategies for effective uptake
   included faculty incentives, adequate funding, administrative support,,
   and dedicated time and resources.
   Conclusion. Despite the availability of a comprehensive curriculum, its
   diffusion into general surgery residency programs remains low. Obstacles
   related to successful implementation include personnel, learner, and
   administrative issues. Addressing these issues may improve the adoption
   rate of the curriculum.}},

Abstract = {{Federal initiatives are underway that provide physicians with financial
   incentives for meaningful use (MU) of electronic health records (EHRs)
   and assistance to purchase and implement EHRs.
   We sought to examine readiness and interest in MU among primary care
   physicians and specialists, and identify factors that may affect their
   readiness to obtain MU incentives.
   We analyzed 4 years of data (2008-2011) from the National Ambulatory
   Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) Electronic Medical Record (EMR) Supplement,
   an annual cross-sectional nationally representative survey of
   non-federally employed office-based physicians.
   Survey-weighted EHR adoption rates, potential to meet selected MU
   criteria, and self-reported intention to apply for MU incentives. We
   also examined the association between physician and practice
   characteristics and readiness for MU.
   The overall sample consisted of 10,889 respondents, with weighted
   response rates of 62 \% (2008); 74 \% (2009); 66 \% (2010); and 61 \%
   (2011). Primary care physicians' adoption of EHRs with the potential to
   meet MU nearly doubled from 2009 to 2011 (18 \% to 38 \%, p < 0.01), and
   was significantly higher than specialists (19 \%) in 2011 (p < 0.01). In
   2011, half of physicians (52 \%) expressed their intention to apply for
   MU incentives; this did not vary by specialty. Multivariate analyses
   report that EHR adoption was significantly higher in both 2010 and 2011
   compared to 2009, and primary care physicians and physicians working in
   larger or multi-specialty practices or for HMOs were more likely to
   adopt EHRs with the potential to meet MU.
   Physician EHR adoption rates increased in advance of MU incentive
   payments. Although interest in MU incentives did not vary by specialty,
   primary care physicians had significantly higher rates of adopting EHRs
   with the potential to meet MU. Addressing barriers to EHR adoption,
   which may vary by specialty, will be important to enhancing coordination
   of care.}},

   monitor the quality of postgraduate training. Low response rates
   threaten the utility of this research tool. The purpose of this study
   was to determine the standard response rate of surveys administered to
   surgery residents and identify characteristics associated with achieving
   greater response rates.
   Methods. A search of peer-reviewed literature published between
   September 2003 and June 2011 was performed with the use of PubMed with
   Medical Subject Headings: ``internship and residency,{''} ``surgery,{''}
   ``data collection,{''} and ``questionnaires.{''} For inclusion, articles
   must have described a survey given to active surgery residents within
   the United States. Surveys were evaluated based on the following
   criteria: population size, response rate, incentive use, follow-up use,
   survey format (online vs paper), and institution versus national.
   Results. Of 433 initial results, 47 met inclusion criteria with a mean
   response rate of 65.3\%. Surveys administered in paper format had a
   greater response rate compared with those given electronically (mean
   78.6\% vs 36.4\%, respectively, P < .001). Greatest mean response rates
   were seen for institutional surveys compared with those given nationally
   (83.1\% vs 42\% respectively, P < .001)
   Conclusion. Our review demonstrated that paper surveys administered at
   the institutional level and during assemblies integrated into residents'
   schedules demonstrated enhanced response rates. The validity and
   generalizability of data collected through such survey's will improve as
   the aspects which dictate response rate are better understood and
   implemented.}},

Title = {{Malaria and protective behaviours: is there a malaria trap?}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{JUN 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: In spite of massive efforts to generalize efficient
   prevention, such as insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITN) or
   long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), malaria remains prevalent in
   many countries and ITN/LLINs are still only used to a limited extent.
   Methods: This study proposes a new model for malaria economic analysis
   by combining economic epidemiology tools with the literature on poverty
   traps. A theoretical model of rational protective behaviour in response
   to malaria is designed, which includes endogenous externalities and
   disease characteristics. Survey data available for Uganda provide
   empirical support to the theory of prevalence-elastic protection
   behaviours, once endogeneity issues related to epidemiology and poverty
   are solved.
   Results: Two important conclusions emerge from the model. First, agents
   increase their protective behaviour when malaria is more prevalent in a
   society. This is consistent with the literature on ``prevalence-elastic
   behaviour{''}. Second, a `malaria trap' defined as the result of malaria
   reinforcing poverty while poverty reduces the ability to deal with
   malaria can theoretically exist and the conditions of existence of the
   malaria trap are identified.
   Conclusions: These results suggest the possible existence of malaria
   traps, which provides policy implications. Notably, providing ITN/LLINs
   at subsidized prices is not sufficient. To be efficient an ITN/LLINs
   dissemination campaigns should include incentive of the very poor for
   using ITN/LLINs.}},

Title = {{Would You Train Me with My Mental Illness? Evidence from a Discrete
   Choice Experiment}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH POLICY AND ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{67-80}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background: Mental illness is the prime reason for the inflow into
   disability insurance in many countries. The integration of persons with
   a disability into the regular labor market is costly and in the case of
   mentally ill persons, particularly difficult. Supported Education and
   Employment - a rehabilitation method that directly places patients in a
   realistic work environment - has been shown to be effective in
   increasing competitive employment. However, it has not yet been widely
   implemented.
   Aims of the Study: We evaluate ex-ante the willingness to participate in
   Supported Education and Employment and the barriers to do so from the
   employer's perspective.
   Methods: We conducted a discrete choice experiment implemented in an
   online survey. The survey was carried out among all Swiss companies
   which provide standard dual-track vocational education and training for
   commercial occupations in Eastern Switzerland. We presented respondents
   (employees who are responsible for vocational training and/or for the
   selection of applicants) with a sample of five hypothetical profiles.
   These profiles vary along different medical diagnoses, different illness
   related (dys-)functions, and other characteristics that may be
   associated with a company's willingness to accept the candidate (such as
   school performance, motivation, and illness related absences).
   Respondents were asked whether or not they would train this person.
   Results: 22\% of the profiles are accepted. However, our results
   demonstrate that the hypothetical bias - which is the difference between
   individual saying what they would do in a hypothetical setting and what
   they will do when they have the opportunity - is severe. Correcting for
   this bias using follow-up scales ({''}Are you sure?{''}) reduces the
   overall acceptance in our sample to 9\%. Keeping in mind the response
   rate to our survey of 35\%, overall acceptance may be as low as 3\%.
   Non-cognitive dysfunctions (e.g. non-adherence to regulations,
   difficulties with contacts with others) that are related to mental
   disorders, are the main deterrents. Patients with psychotic disorders
   are particularly disadvantaged.
   Implications for Health Policy: Although there are no direct costs to
   the employer, a wide introduction of Supported Vocational Education and
   Training is likely to fail at the current stage with the unwillingness
   of companies to train people with special needs. There may be additional
   incentives needed, for example in form of subsidies or legal
   requirements. Even though our experiment has been tailored to the Swiss
   system, our results may also be relevant in other countries with similar
   dual-track education systems.}},

Abstract = {{While a large literature indicates that using a mixed-mode approach to
   notify or contact potential respondents can be effective in increasing

   mode of invitation has on participation in a web survey. To assess the
   effects of invitation mode on response rates, costs, and demographic

   assigned to experimental groups and sent a mailed invitation letter and
   a \$2 cash incentive; a mailed invitation letter only; or an e-mailed
   invitation. Nonresponding faculty received up to two reminders to
   participate, by e-mail. Results indicated that the response rates were
   higher for the groups invited using a postal letter, but the inclusion
   of \$2 did not significantly increase the response rates. Consistent
   with expectations, while costs were higher for the mailed invitation
   groups, the mailed invitations improved the demographic
   representativeness of the respondents, especially for the \$2 incentive
   group. This study builds on a small body of literature that explicitly

   that higher business incentive use is associated with greater attention

Title = {{Do Canadian Researchers and the Lay Public Prioritize Biomedical

Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{519-526}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   To quantify and compare the preferences of researchers and laypeople in
   Canada regarding the outcomes of basic biomedical research.
   Method
   In autumn 2010, the authors conducted a cross-sectional, national survey
   of basic biomedical researchers funded by Canada's national health
   research agency and a representative sample of Canadian citizens to
   assess preferences for research outcomes across five attributes using a
   discrete choice experiment. Attributes included advancing scientific
   knowledge (assessed by published papers); building research capacity
   (assessed by trainees); informing decisions in the health products
   industry (assessed by patents); targeting economic, health, or
   scientific priorities; and cost. The authors reduced a fractional
   factorial design (18 pairwise choices plus an opt-out option) to three
   blocks of six. They also computed part worth utilities, differences in
   predicted probabilities, and willingness-to-pay values using nested
   logit models.
   Results
   Of 3,260 potential researchers, 1,749 (53.65\% response rate) completed
   the questionnaire, along with 1,002 citizens. Researchers and citizens
   prioritized high-quality scientific outcomes (papers, trainees) over
   other attributes. Both groups disvalued research targeted at economic
   priorities relative to health priorities. Researchers granted a premium
   to proposals targeting scientific priorities.
   Conclusions
   Citizens and researchers fundamentally prioritized the same outcomes for
   basic biomedical research. Notably, they prioritized traditional
   scientific outcomes and disvalued the pursuit of economic returns. These
   findings have implications for how academic medicine assigns incentives
   and value to basic health research and how biomedical researchers and
   the public may jointly contribute to setting the future research agenda.}},

Abstract = {{Background: It is generally understood that shorter Web surveys and use
   of incentives result in higher response rates in Web surveys directed to
   health care providers. Less is known about potential respondent
   preference for reduced burden as compared to increased reward.
   Objective: To help elicit preference for minimized burden compared to
   reward for completion of a survey, we observed physician preferences for
   shorter Web surveys compared to incentives as well as incentive
   preference (small guaranteed incentive compared to larger lottery
   incentive) accompanying an electronic request to complete a survey.
   Methods: This was an observational study that accompanied a large Web
   survey study of radiology staff, fellows, and residents at select
   academic medical centers in the United States. With the request to
   complete the survey, potential respondents were offered three options:
   (1) a 10-minute Web survey with the chance to win an iPad, (2) a
   10-minute Web survey with a guaranteed nominal incentive (\$ 5 amazon.
   com gift card), or (3) a shorter (5-7 minute) Web survey with no
   incentive. A total of 254 individuals responded to the Web survey
   request.
   Results: Overwhelmingly, individuals chose a longer survey accompanied
   by an incentive compared to a shorter survey with no incentive (85\%
   compared to 15\%, P <. 001). Of those opting for an incentive, a small,
   but not significant majority chose the chance to win an iPad over a
   guaranteed \$5 gift card (56\% compared to 44\%).
   Conclusions: When given the choice, radiologists preferred a reward
   (either guaranteed or based on a lottery) to a less burdensome survey,
   indicating that researchers should focus more attention at increasing
   perceived benefits of completing a Web survey compared to decreasing

Abstract = {{Accurate domestic-hot water (DHW) consumption information is useful for
   solar-thermal-hot-water-system designers and policy makers supporting
   solar-thermal-incentive programs. Conducting field studies of
   DHW-consumption patterns is difficult and costly, and as a result, there
   are few studies available in the body of literature. Several DHW models
   exist, however these aggregate models are often dated and most fail to
   identify the influence of the number of occupants in the dwelling,
   instead relying on a standard-per-capita consumption. The standard of 60
   liters/capita/day (lcd) is found to be accurate for households of 4 or
   more occupants, but significantly under estimates per-capita-hot-water
   consumption for households with 3 or fewer occupants, consequently,
   under estimating the energy and GHG-emissions savings of solar-DHW
   programs {[}1]. The new estimate presented here addresses these issues.
   This study was conducted using utility-billing data, and occupant
   responses from a survey of 1594 residences. The data includes annual
   total-water use, energy consumption, costs, and basic information about
   the residence and occupants. The method isolates average-oil used in
   water heaters and then estimates system performance to calculate the
   volume of hot water heated. The findings include total-water use, oil
   consumption for water heating, and DHW use based on occupancy for
   households of 1 through 6 occupants. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In the U.S. today, there is a significant danger that walkable

   housing developers that was conducted to provide a better understanding

   prevalence of walkable, mixed-income neighborhoods from the point of
   view of developers. Thirty-four developers from around the U.S. were
   interviewed by telephone in November and December, 2010. Five themes
   emerged from the survey: the need for financing and access to capital
   and subsidy; the need for reform of financial regulation; the need for
   reform of land use regulation; the need for incentives; and the need for
   better communication and networking. Responses to the survey underscored
   the frustrations affordable housing developers are having with
   development more generally, and how those frustrations are amplified
   when trying to locate affordable housing in walkable, mixed-income
   neighborhoods. The paper concludes by suggesting strategies that could
   be employed to help promote walkable, mixed-income neighborhoods, beyond
   the obvious need for better access to capital: support for research that
   focuses on the benefits of mixed-income neighborhoods; documentation and
   illumination of best practices; and the fostering of communication and

   data on all invitees was used to compare response rates and respondents,
   and web-based data collection on participants was used to compare
   substantive findings. Participants randomized to the pre-incentive plus

Abstract = {{Despite the proven efficacy of decision aids as interventions for
   increasing patient engagement and facilitating shared decision making,
   they are not used routinely in clinical care. Findings from a project
   designed to achieve such integration, conducted at five primary care
   practices in 2010-12, document low rates of distribution of decision
   aids to eligible patients due for colorectal cancer screening (9.3
   percent) and experiencing back pain (10.7 percent). There were also no
   lasting increases in distribution rates in response to training sessions
   and other promotional activities for physicians and clinic staff. The
   results of focus groups, ethnographic field notes, and surveys suggest
   that major structural and cultural changes in health care practice and
   policy are necessary to achieve the levels of use of decision aids and
   shared decision making in routine practice envisioned in current policy.
   Among these changes are ongoing incentives for use, physician training,
   and a team-based practice model in which all care team members bear
   formal responsibility for the use of decision aids in routine primary
   care.}},

Volume = {{45}},

Pages = {{122-127}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Despite 30 years of policy initiatives and
   rural-focused programs, the number of physicians in rural practice
   remains unchanged and insufficient for the needs of rural communities.
   The practice characteristics of graduates of a rural family medicine
   residency program are identified, including community size, practice
   content and procedures, and hospital and outpatient services offered and
   track any changes in practice location and services.
   METHODS: A postgraduate survey instrument was sent to all graduates of
   Cascades East Family Medicine Residency beginning with the initial class
   of graduates and ending with the alumnae who completed the program in
   2009. The response rate was 82\%, and data were collated and analyzed
   for practice content and demographic characteristics. Changes in
   practice location and content were summarized.
   RESULTS: Most graduates are located in demonstrated areas of need
   immediately following graduation: 60\% entered practice in population
   centers of less than 25,000; 63\% are located in health professional
   shortage areas (HPSAs). There was an insignificant migration from rural
   to urban locations and little change in practice content over the
   duration of the study.
   CONCLUSIONS: As a result of this survey, we are aware of the
   postgraduate training design that is most successful at producing
   primary care physicians who enter isolated rural practice in areas of
   greatest need. There is a requirement for training incentives, federal
   funding, and Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education
   flexibility to support and accommodate the unique needs of training
   programs that demonstrate clear outcomes that are congruent with the
   needs of the rural American population and produce physicians who enter
   rural practice. (Fam Med 2013;45(2):122-7.)}},

Abstract = {{Web surveys have become increasingly central to innovation research but
   often suffer from low response rates. Based on a cost-benefits framework
   and the explicit consideration of heterogeneity across respondents, we
   consider the effects of key contact design features such as
   personalization, incentives, and the exact timing of survey contacts on
   web survey response rates. We also consider the benefits of a ``dynamic
   strategy{''}, i.e., the approach to change features of survey contacts
   over the survey life cycle. We explore these effects experimentally
   using a career survey sent to over 24,000 junior scientists and
   engineers. The results show that personalization increases the odds of
   responding by as much as 48\%, while lottery incentives with a high
   payoff and a low chance of winning increase the odds of responding by
   30\%. Furthermore, changing the wording of reminders over the survey
   life cycle increases the odds of a response by over 30\%, while changes
   in contact timing (day of the week or hour of the day) did not have
   significant benefits. Improvements in response rates did not come at the
   expense of lower data quality. Our results provide novel insights into

Abstract = {{Longevity is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. The
   brain's dopamine system may be particularly relevant, since it modulates
   traits (e.g., sensitivity to reward, incentive motivation, sustained
   effort) that impact behavioral responses to the environment. In
   particular, the dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) has been shown to moderate
   the impact of environments on behavior and health. We tested the
   hypothesis that the DRD4 gene influences longevity and that its impact
   is mediated through environmental effects. Surviving participants of a
   30-year-old population-based health survey (N = 310; age range, 90-109
   years; the 90+ Study) were genotyped/resequenced at the DRD4 gene and
   compared with a European ancestry-matched younger population (N = 2902;
   age range, 7-45 years). We found that the oldest-old population had a
   66\% increase in individuals carrying the DRD47R allele relative to the
   younger sample (p = 3.5 x 10(-9)), and that this genotype was strongly
   correlated with increased levels of physical activity. Consistent with
   these results, DRD4 knock-out mice, when compared with wild-type and
   heterozygous mice, displayed a 7-9.7\% decrease in lifespan, reduced
   spontaneous locomotor activity, and no lifespan increase when reared in
   an enriched environment. These results support the hypothesis that DRD4
   gene variants contribute to longevity in humans and in mice, and suggest
   that this effect is mediated by shaping behavioral responses to the
   environment.}},

Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Pages = {{208-224}},
Abstract = {{Agricultural farmers are experiencing change in how they must manage
   surface water storage systems. When faced with water shortage in times
   of drought, there is an incentive to build up stores of water and this
   can be inequitable for users downstream. Furthermore, in times of water
   surplus in flood, the storage structures can become unsafe, with
   catastrophic consequences. Despite the importance of the `dual-extreme'
   problem of unsustainably managed farm dams, there is also evidence of
   deficiencies and inconsistencies in farm dam management policy across
   Australia. When coupled with evidence of widespread unsustainable farm
   dam management practice, the way farmers respond to management pressures
   from regulators becomes a critical concern. The research applies
   Oliver's strategic response typology to a survey of 202 farmers in two
   states in Australia with different levels of sustainable surface water
   storage equity and safety policy: disconnectedness in South Australia,
   and interconnectedness in Tasmania. Results suggest that even in a
   strong, interconnected policy environment, where laws are in line with
   farmer goals and do not infringe on decision-making power, there may
   still be resistance and attempts to manipulate the regulatory pressures.

Journal = {{TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{115}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background/Context: Institutional theories sometimes characterize the
   normative influence of institutions as diffusing like waves and as
   exerting uniform pressures on individuals. This article contributes to a
   growing literature on the microfoundations of institutions,
   investigating how intraorganizational networks mediate the diffusion of
   institutions on teachers' instructional practices.
   Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: This study focused
   on the normative influence of reading policy on teaching practice in the
   early 2000s. We chose to focus on reading during this period, which was
   marked by an unusual level of policy coherence. Federal and state
   agencies, as well as school districts, implemented a number of policies
   and programs to encourage teachers to follow the National Reading
   Panel's (2000) recommendations to emphasize basic skills development in
   reading instructional practices.
   Setting: The research took place in 11 elementary schools. An important
   note is that the pressure teachers experienced in these schools to adopt
   the practices recommended by the National Reading Panel was indirect.
   The schools in the study did include three Title I schools, but no
   schools in programs that required them to adopt these practices. All
   schools used state-adopted curricula in reading that were aligned with
   recommended practices.
   Population/Participants/Subjects: All faculty members in the 11 schools
   were part of the study from 2004 to 2008. The sample in the final
   analysis (n = 136) included teachers with direct responsibilities for
   teaching reading in a single school over these 4 years. This figure
   represents 84.47\% of our original sample (N = 161).
   Research Design: This study is a longitudinal observational study that
   includes social network data and multilevel analysis. We surveyed
   faculty four times in waves conducted in 2004, 2005, 2007, and 2008.
   Data Collection and Analysis: The primary source of data was a survey
   that asked teachers to identify their close colleagues and colleagues
   who provided them with help on reading instruction (including measures
   of frequency of interaction). The dependent measure in our analyses was
   based teachers' responses to items about instructional practices in
   reading, especially skills-based instructional practices. We fit
   multilevel models to estimate the extent to which reading practices were
   a function of teachers' interactions with colleagues and their
   membership in subgroups, which were identified from the indicators of
   closest colleagues using Frank's algorithm.
   Findings/Results: Teachers' practices did not conform exclusively to the
   new normative regime but rather depended on exposure to external
   professional development in reading instruction and on local norms of
   practice in their schools and collegial subgroups. Over time, moreover,
   subgroups' practices diverged with respect to teachers' implementation
   of skills-based reading instructional practices.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: Our study findings provide strong evidence
   that local social dynamics such as the ones we illuminate here are key
   in shaping the implementation trajectory of any instructional practice
   or reform. Policies may set the stage for adopting particular practices
   and direct resources toward certain kinds of supports through curriculum
   and professional development programs they incentivize. However,
   teachers' interactions with colleagues mediate the response to these
   directions and incentives in ways that can produce outcomes that diverge
   widely from policy makers' intentions.}},

   Intentions of Young Women Living in Urban and Rural Areas of Australia:
   Face-to-Face Discussions to Increase Participation in a Web-Based Survey}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{Background: It is imperative to understand how to engage young women in
   research about issues that are important to them. There is limited
   reliable data on how young women access contraception in Australia
   especially in rural areas where services may be less available.
   Objective: This paper identifies the challenges involved in engaging
   young Australian women aged 18-23 years to participate in a web-based
   survey on contraception and pregnancy and ensure their ongoing
   commitment to follow-up web-based surveys.
   Methods: A group of young women, aged 18-23 years and living in urban
   and rural New South Wales, Australia, were recruited to participate in
   face-to-face discussions using several methods of recruitment: direct
   contact (face-to-face, telephone or email) and snowball sampling by
   potential participants inviting their friends. All discussions were
   transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis.
   Results: Twenty young women participated (urban, n=10: mean age 21.6
   years; rural, n=10: 20.0 years) and all used computers or smart phones
   to access the internet on a daily basis. All participants were concerned
   about the cost of internet access and utilized free access to social
   media on their mobile phones. Their willingness to participate in a
   web-based survey was dependent on incentives with a preference for small
   financial rewards. Most participants were concerned about their personal
   details and survey responses remaining confidential and secure. The most
   appropriate survey would take up to 15 minutes to complete, be a mix of
   short and long questions and eye-catching with bright colours. Questions
   on the sensitive topics of sexual activity, contraception and pregnancy
   were acceptable if they could respond with ``I prefer not to answer{''}.
   Conclusions: There are demographic, participation and survey design
   challenges in engaging young women in a web-based survey. Based on our
   findings, future research efforts are needed to understand the full
   extent of the role social media and incentives play in the decision of
   young women to participate in web-based research. (J Med Internet Res

Volume = {{52}},

Abstract = {{Based upon the results from extensive building monitoring and surveys on
   occupant's behaviors in a representative nine-story apartment building
   in northern China, building energy simulations were performed to
   evaluate the impacts of integrative retrofits implemented. Integrative
   retrofits required by the newer building energy standard produced
   significant heating-energy savings (i.e., 53\%) when compared with
   baseline buildings commonly built in early 1980s. Taking into account
   district-heating-system upgrades as part of integrative retrofit
   measures, a representative apartment building was 66\% more efficient
   than the baseline building. Contrary to expectation, little behavioral
   change was found in response to the provisions of monetary incentive,
   billing-method reform, or metering of heating energy use in individual
   apartment units. Yet this paper identified sizable energy savings
   potential if occupants' behavioral changes were to actually happen. This
   indicates that provisions of financial incentives or individual metering
   were insufficient for triggering substantial behavioral changes leading
   toward more energy savings in the current buildings. It is recommended
   that innovative energy policies, technology upgrades, and education
   would be needed to promote behavioral changes toward additional energy
   savings. Finally, measures and strategies to further enhance thermal
   integrity criteria (e.g., insulations of roof and balcony) are
   recommended in China's future building energy policy reforms. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Purpose
   To document the frequency of policies and activities in support of
   mentoring practices at institutions receiving a U.S. National Institutes
   of Health's Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA).
   Method
   The study consisted of a 69-item survey with questions about the
   inclusion (formal or informal) of policies, activities, and structures
   supporting mentoring within CTSA-sponsored research (i.e., KL2 programs)
   and, more broadly, in the CTSA's home institution. The survey, conducted
   from November 2010 through January 2011, was sent to the 55 institutions
   awarded CTSAs at the time of the survey. Follow-up phone interviews were
   conducted to clarify responses as needed.
   Results
   Fifty-one of 55 (92\%) institutions completed the survey for
   institutional programs and 53 of 55 (96\%) for KL2 programs. Responses
   regarding policies and activities involving mentor criteria,
   mentor-mentee relationship, incentives, and evaluative mechanisms
   revealed considerable variability between KL2 and institutional programs
   in some areas, such as having mentor qualification criteria and
   processes to evaluate mentors. The survey also identified areas, such as
   training and women and minority mentoring programs, where there was
   frequent sharing of activities between the institutional and KL2
   programs.
   Conclusions
   KL2 programs and institutional programs tend to have different
   preferences for policies versus activities to optimize qualification of
   mentors, the mentor-mentee relationship, incentives, and evaluation
   mechanisms. Frequently, these elements are informal. Individuals in
   charge of implementing and maintaining mentoring initiatives can use the
   results of the study to consider their current mentoring policies,
   structures, and activities by comparing them with national patterns
   within CTSA institutions.}},

   using monetary incentives and the conditions under which they are
   hypothesized to be particularly effective. Finally, it summarizes
   research on how incentives affect response rates in cross-sectional and
   longitudinal studies and, to the extent information is available, how
   they affect response quality, nonresponse error, and cost-effectiveness.

Title = {{Factors influencing clinical trial site selection in Europe: the Survey
   of Attitudes towards Trial sites in Europe (the SAT-EU Study)}},
Journal = {{BMJ OPEN}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{11}},
Abstract = {{Objectives Applications to run clinical trials in Europe fell 25\%
   between 2007 and 2011. Costs, speed of approvals and shortcomings of
   European Clinical Trial Directive are commonly invoked to explain this
   unsatisfactory performance. However, no hard evidence is available on
   the actual weight of these factors or has it been previously
   investigated whether other criteria may also impact clinical trial site
   selection.
   Design The Survey of Attitudes towards Trial sites in Europe (SAT-EU
   Study) was an anonymous, cross-sectional web-based survey that
   systematically assessed factors impacting European clinical trial site
   selection. It explored 19 factors across investigator-driven,
   hospital-driven and environment-driven criteria, and costs. It also
   surveyed perceptions of the European trial environment.
   Setting and participants Clinical research organisations (CROs),
   academic clinical trial units (CTUs) and industry invited to respond.
   Outcome measures Primary outcome: weight assigned to each factor
   hypothesised to impact trial site selection and trial incidence.
   Secondary outcome: desirability of European countries to run clinical
   trials.
   Results Responses were obtained from 485 professionals in 34 countries:
   49\% from BioPharma, 40\% from CTUs or CROs. Investigator-dependent,
   environment-dependent and hospital-dependent factors were rated highly
   important, costs being less important (p<0.0001). Within
   environment-driven criteria, pool of eligible patients, speed of
   approvals and presence of disease-management networks were significantly
   more important than costs or government financial incentives (p<0.0001).
   The pattern of response was consistent across respondent groupings (CTU
   vs CRO vs industry). Considerable variability was demonstrated in the
   perceived receptivity of countries to undertake clinical trials, with
   Germany, the UK and the Netherlands rated the best trial markets
   (p<0.0001).
   Conclusions Investigator-dependent factors and ease of approval dominate
   trial site selection, while costs appear less important. Fostering
   competitiveness of European clinical research may not require additional
   government spending/incentives. Rather, harmonisation of approval
   processes, greater visibility of centres of excellence and reduction of
   hidden' indirect costs, may bring significantly more clinical trials to
   Europe.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT AND LAND USE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{21-32}},
Abstract = {{Across the United States, metropolitan areas face challenges related to
   transportation and land use. An emerging policy in many regions is to
   promote development around higher-density, mixed-use (smart-growth)
   centers that create locally accessible nodes; many of these nodes are
   also linked to transit stops. Some metropolitan planning organizations
   (MPOs) have developed regional plans and incentive programs to encourage
   local governments to develop these centers. Incentives include grants as
   well as funding criteria in transportation improvement programs (TIP)
   that favor projects supporting centers. This paper assesses these
   policies as they have been applied in: (1) Puget Sound, Washington; (2)
   Portland, Oregon; (3) Denver, Colorado; and (4) San Diego, California.
   For the four regions we reviewed documents, conducted 40 interviews with
   key individuals, administered an online survey of 450 experts (response
   rate = 44 percent), and held a two-day forum involving 40 participants.
   We found that incentive policies by themselves were having a limited
   impact because they are new and offer small amounts of funding relative
   to local government needs and market forces. However, when incentives
   are combined with plans, policies, and transit investment, they provide
   a significant foundation for promoting growth around centers. There are
   a number of ways these policies can be improved, and many policies are
   transferable to other metropolitan regions.}},

Abstract = {{Surveys undergird government statistical systems and social scientific
   research throughout the world. Rates of nonresponse are rising in
   cross-sectional surveys (those conducted during a fixed period of time
   and not repeated). Although this trend worries those concerned with the
   validity of survey data, there is no necessary relationship between the
   rate of nonresponse and the degree of bias. A high rate of nonresponse
   merely creates the potential for bias, but the degree of bias depends on
   how factors promoting nonresponse are related to variables of interest.
   Nonresponse can be reduced by offering financial incentives to
   respondents and by careful design before entering the field, creating a
   trade-off between cost and potential bias. When bias is suspected, it
   can be countered by weighting individual cases by the inverse of their
   response propensity. Response propensities are typically estimated using
   a logistic regression equation to predict the dichotomous outcome of
   survey participation as a function of auxiliary variables. The
   Multi-level Integrated Database Approach employs multiple databases to
   collect as much information as possible about the target sample during
   the initial sampling stage and at all possible levels of aggregation to
   maximize the accuracy of estimated response propensities.}},

Abstract = {{We present the results of a randomized experiment to test the
   effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of response incentives for a
   stated-preference survey of a general community population. The survey
   was administered using a mixed-mode approach, in which community members
   were invited to participate using a traditional mailed letter using
   contact information for a representative sample of the community; but
   individuals completed the survey via the web, which exploited the
   advantages of electronic capture. Individuals were randomized to four
   incentive groups: (a) no incentive, (b) prepaid cash incentive (\$2),
   (c) a low lottery (10 prizes of \$25) and (d) a high lottery (2 prizes
   of \$250). Letters of invitation were mailed to 3,000 individuals. In
   total, 405 individuals (14.4\%) contacted the website and 277 (9.8\%)
   provided complete responses. The prepaid cash incentive generated the
   highest contact and response rates (23.3 and 17.3\%, respectively), and
   no incentive generated the lowest (9.1 and 5.7\%, respectively). The
   high lottery, however, was the most cost-effective incentive for
   obtaining completed surveys: compared with no incentive, the incremental
   cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per completed survey for high lottery
   was \$13.89; for prepaid cash, the ICER was \$18.29. This finding
   suggests that the preferred response incentive for community-based,

Abstract = {{Background and objective The acceptability of financial incentives for
   organ donation is contentious. This study sought to determine (1) the
   acceptability of expense reimbursement or financial incentives by the
   general public, health professionals involved with organ donation and
   transplantation, and those with or affected by kidney disease and (2)
   for the public, whether financial incentives would alter their
   willingness to consider donation.
   Design, setting, participants, \& measurements Web-based survey
   administered to members of the Canadian public, health professionals,
   and people with or affected by kidney disease asking questions regarding
   acceptability of strategies to increase living and deceased kidney
   donation and willingness to donate a kidney under various financial
   incentives.
   Results Responses were collected from 2004 members of the Canadian
   public October 11-18,2011; responses from health professionals (n=339)
   and people with or affected by kidney disease (n=268) were collected
   during a 4-week period commencing October 11, 2011. Acceptability of one
   or more financial incentives to increase deceased and living donation
   was noted in >70\% and 40\% of all groups, respectively. Support for
   monetary payment for living donors was 45\%, 14\%, and 27\% for the
   public, health professionals, and people with or affected by kidney
   disease, respectively. Overall, reimbursement of funeral expenses for
   deceased donors and a tax break for living donors were the most
   acceptable.
   Conclusion The general public views regulated financial incentives for
   living and deceased donation to be acceptable. Future research needs to
   examine the impact of financial incentives on rates of deceased and

   We propose several explanations for this result: adding a mode option

Number = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Surveys of cancer patients are an important means of collecting data
   necessary to improve cancer prevention and control. However, health
   surveys generally are characterized by declining response rates, with
   incentives often employed to encourage participation. While successful,
   magnitude of effect is partially dependent upon situational
   characteristics of respondents, including health status. Given the
   health challenges experienced by cancer patients, it is unclear to what
   extent incentives can improve survey participation. In this study, we
   examine the effectiveness of monetary and non-monetary incentives in
   improving response to cancer patient surveys.
   We reviewed the available experimental literature regarding efforts to
   improve response rates among cancer patients/survivors via incentives.
   Relevant studies were identified through searches of the MEDLINE,
   PubMed, and PsychINFO databases from 1975 to 2012. Seed sources (e.g.,
   Cancer Causes \& Control, Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers \& Prevention,
   and BMC Medical Research Methodology) were also referenced extensively
   in order to establish a comprehensive set of studies.
   Although limited, evidence does suggest that token incentives may be
   less effective for improving survey participation among cancer patients,
   relative to other population groups. These results are contrary to
   well-established evidence regarding the efficacy of incentives in
   improving survey participation generally. Potential reasons why
   incentives may be less effective in this population are explored.
   While more research is necessary, results suggest that survey research
   strategies targeting cancer patients be purposively designed in a manner
   that gives consideration to the distress associated with the condition,
   including selection of alternative strategies to improve response.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale, aims and objectives Unprecedented national and state
   initiatives are underway to promote adoption and meaningful use of
   electronic health records (EHRs) with health information exchange (HIE).
   New York State leads the nation in state initiatives and is conducting
   ongoing surveillance of its investments. Lessons learned from studying
   states like New York can inform federal policies and will be essential
   to evaluate the effectiveness of these initiatives. We undertook this
   first in a series of planned surveys to assess EHR adoption and HIE
   activities by New York State hospitals.
   Methods Between May and December 2009, we surveyed all New York State
   hospitals to determine rates of EHR adoption, participation in HIE and
   implementation of functionalities associated with nine core meaningful
   use criteria.
   Results We received responses from 148 (72.2\%) of 205 hospitals
   surveyed and found that 23 (15.5\%) had adopted an EHR and 29 (23.2\%)
   were participating in HIE. Two hospitals (1.4\%) reported full
   implementation of the meaningful use functionalities surveyed. Public
   hospitals were ahead of private hospitals and notable regional
   differences were found.
   Discussion EHR adoption rates and participation in HIE are higher among
   New York hospitals than hospitals nationwide, suggesting that state
   initiatives funding community EHR implementation may influence these
   efforts by hospitals. However, overall rates of adoption and
   preparedness to meet meaningful use remain low. Direct support for
   hospitals, such as that provided through the national EHR Incentive
   Program, will likely be critical for rates of EHR adoption and HIE to
   significantly rise, even in advanced states.}},

Title = {{Challenges in identifying barriers to adoption in a theory-based
   implementation study: lessons for future implementation studies}},
Journal = {{BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Exploring barriers to the uptake of research based
   recommendations into practice is an important part of the development of
   implementation programmes. Techniques to identify barriers can include
   use of theory-informed questionnaires and qualitative interviews.
   Conceptualising and measuring theory-informed factors, and engaging
   health professionals' to uncover all potential barriers, can be a
   difficult task. This paper presents a case study of the process of
   trying to identify, systematically, the key factors influencing health
   professionals' referrals for women diagnosed with mild to moderate
   postnatal depression for psychological treatment. The paper illustrates
   how the factors were conceptualised and measured and explores the real
   world challenges experienced, with implications for future
   implementation studies.
   Methods: Theory-informed factors were conceptualised and measured using
   a questionnaire and interviews. The questionnaire was piloted, before
   being administered to general practitioners, practice nurses and health
   visitors working in general practices in one area of the UK NHS. The
   interviews were conducted with a small sample of general practitioners
   who had not completed the questionnaire, further exploring factors
   influencing their referral decisions in the local context.
   Results: The response rate to the questionnaire was low (19\%), despite
   selecting the recommendation to target through engagement with local
   stakeholders and surveying local health professionals, and despite using
   two reminders, an incentive prize, and phone calls to practice managers
   to bolster response rates.
   Conclusions: Two significant challenges to achieving higher response
   rates and successfully exploring local context were identified: the
   difficulties of developing a robust-but feasible-questionnaire to
   explore theory-informed factors, and targeting recommendations that are
   important to policy makers, but which health professionals view as
   unimportant. This case study highlights the ``trade-off{''} between
   scientifically rigorous collection of data against the pragmatism and
   flexibility requirements of ``real world{''} implementation. Future
   implementation studies should explore different ways of identifying
   factors influencing the adoption of recommendations to bridge this gulf.}},

Abstract = {{Health information technology (HIT) is a cornerstone of health care
   reform, is critical for transformation of current outpatient practices
   to patient-centered health homes (PCHHs), and has potential to improve
   health outcomes. To determine the current level of electronic health
   record (EHR) implementation in California's outpatient safety-net, we
   conducted a web-based survey of the California Primary Care
   Association's member clinics (response rate 127/181 (70\%)). Seventy-two
   (59\%) clinics had not implemented electronic health records (EHR), 26
   (21\%) were all electronic, 23 (19\%) were both paper and electronic,
   and two (2\%) had no plans to implement EHR; the remaining four
   responses are missing. The majority of clinics allotted less than 6\% of
   their budget to health information technology and 64\% of those planning
   on implementing an EHR reported needing additional staff. California's
   safety net systems are likely to need additional support to successfully
   benefit from health care reform incentives.}},

Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Objective. The aim of this study is to assess public support for a
   smoking cessation policy involving financial incentives.
   Methods. We conducted a randomized controlled trial using an
   experimental survey design. One of four questionnaire versions was
   distributed to participants. Each version described a smoking cessation
   treatment costing \$750 per success, including an unspecified treatment,
   medication, or financial incentive paid to the smoker. Participants
   indicated whether they would support a \$25 increase in their annual
   health insurance premium to pay for the treatment. Questionnaires were
   distributed to adults waiting at public transportation depots in
   Philadelphia between May and August 2010.
   Results. 1010 individuals completed the questionnaires about willingness
   to support the policy: 53\% female, 27\% African-American, 18\% current
   smokers, and 46\% with a household income below \$40,000. The response
   rate was greater than 50\%. Overall support for all smoking cessation
   treatments was 41.6\%. The financial incentive version received the
   lowest support (393\%) but that support did not statistically differ
   from the treatment (45.8\%, p=0.14) or medication (41.7\%, p=0.58)
   versions.
   Conclusions. Financial incentives were perceived no differently than
   currently used medications for smoking cessation. Most participants did
   not support any smoking cessation treatment options. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Objective: To develop a research productivity scoring program within an
   academic department of surgery that would help realign incentives to
   encourage and reward research. Although research is highly valued in the
   academic mission, financial incentives are generally aligned to reward
   clinical productivity.
   Methods: A formula assigning points for publications and extramural
   grants was created and used to award a research incentive payment
   proportional to the research productivity score, beginning July 2007.
   Publication points reflect journal impact factor, author role, and
   manuscript type. Grant points reflect total funding and percentage of
   effort. Publication data were gathered from Web of
   Science/PubMed/Medline and grants data from the departmental grants
   office. An annual award is presented to the person with the greatest
   improvement. The research productivity score data after July 2007 were
   compared with control data for the 2 preceding years. A 33-question
   survey to 28 clinical faculty was conducted after the first year to
   measure satisfaction and solicit constructive feedback.
   Results: The mean annual point scores increased from the preresearch
   productivity score to the postresearch productivity score academic years
   (2180 vs 3389, respectively, P = .08), with a significant change in the
   grant component score (272 vs 801, P = .03). Since research productivity
   score implementation, the operative case volumes increased 4.3\% from
   2006 to 2011. With a response rate of 89\%, the survey indicated that
   76\% of the faculty wished to devote more time to research and 52\%
   believed 1 or more research-related behaviors would change because of
   the research productivity score program.
   Conclusions: An objective, transparent research incentive program,
   through both monetary incentives and recognition, can stimulate
   productivity and was well-received by faculty. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg

Title = {{A Survey to Assess Family Physicians' Motivation to Teach Undergraduates
   in Their Practices}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: In Germany, family physicians (FPs) are increasingly needed
   to participate in undergraduate medical education. Knowledge of FPs'
   motivation to teach medical students in their practices is lacking.
   Purpose: To describe a novel questionnaire that assesses the motivation
   of FPs to teach undergraduates in their practices and to show the
   results of a subsequent survey using this instrument.
   Methods: The questionnaire was developed based on a review of the
   literature. Previously used empirical instruments assessing occupational
   values and motivation were included. A preliminary version was pretested
   in a pilot study. The resulting 68-item questionnaire was sent to 691
   FPs involved in undergraduate medical education. Reliability was
   assessed and subgroups were analyzed with regard to differences in
   motivation.
   Results: A total of 523 physicians in n = 458 teaching practices
   participated (response rate 75.7\%). `Helping others' and `interest'
   were revealed as the predominant motives. Responses showed a
   predominantly intrinsic motivation of the participating FPs. Their main
   incentives were an ambition to work as a medical preceptor, to generally
   improve undergraduate education and to share knowledge. Material
   compensation was of minor importance. Time restraints were indicated as
   a barrier by some FPs, but were not a general concern.
   Conclusion: German FPs involved in medical education have altruistic
   attitudes towards teaching medical students in their practices.
   Motivational features give an important insight for the recruitment of
   FP preceptors as well as for their training in instructional methods.}},

Pages = {{E105+}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: To determine factors that affect nonparticipation in an
   employee diabetes program and factors that may increase participation in
   future employee health programs.
   Methods: Participants in this cross-sectional study were adults with
   type 1 or type 2 diabetes, 18 to 80 years of age, who were covered by
   employer insurance but chose not to participate in an employer-sponsored
   diabetes program. Potential factors affecting program participation were
   assessed through a face-to-face or mailed survey.
   Results: Of 204 employees or their dependents eligible for the diabetes
   program, 75 (37\%) chose not to participate. Among the nonparticipants,
   46 (61\%) were eligible for this study. A total of 22 surveys were
   collected for a 48\% response rate. The majority of those individuals
   surveyed (91\%) were aware of the diabetes program and had been notified
   by mail (42\%) or phone (29\%). Of those surveyed, 33\% did not believe
   that program incentives had been sufficiently explained to them. Work
   schedule was not found to be a determinant of participation. More than
   one-half (52\%) of responders identified satisfaction with their current
   diabetes management as the most notable reason for nonparticipation in
   the employee diabetes program.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the primary reason for program
   nonparticipation was patient satisfaction with current physician
   management of their diabetes. In the future, companies offering health
   programs should emphasize that the program is being offered to
   supplement and complement current disease state management, not to
   replace it.}},

Title = {{National health financing policy in Eritrea: a survey of preliminary
   considerations}},
Journal = {{BMC INTERNATIONAL HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{AUG 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: The 58th World Health Assembly and 56th WHO Regional
   Committee for Africa adopted resolutions urging Member States to ensure
   that health financing systems included a method for prepayment to foster
   financial risk sharing among the population and avoid catastrophic
   health-care expenditure. The Regional Committee asked countries to
   strengthen or develop comprehensive health financing policies. This
   paper presents the findings of a survey conducted among senior staff of
   selected Eritrean ministries and agencies to elicit views on some of the
   elements likely to be part of a national health financing policy.
   Methods: This is a descriptive study. A questionnaire was prepared and
   sent to 19 senior staff (Directors) in the Ministry of Health, Labour
   Department, Civil Service Administration, Eritrean Confederation of
   Workers, National Insurance Corporation of Eritrea and Ministry of Local
   Government. The respondents were selected by the Ministry of Health as
   key informants.
   Results: The key findings were as follows: the response rate was 84.2\%
   (16/19); 37.5\% (6/16) and 18.8\% said that the vision of Eritrean
   National Health Financing Policy (NHFP) should include the phrases
   `equitable and accessible quality health services' and `improve
   efficiency or reduce waste' respectively; over 68\% indicated that NHFP
   should include securing adequate funding, ensuring efficiency, ensuring
   equitable financial access, protection from financial catastrophe, and
   ensuring provider payment mechanisms create positive incentives to
   service providers; over 80\% mentioned community participation,
   efficiency, transparency, country ownership, equity in access, and
   evidence-based decision making as core values of NHFP; over 62.5\%
   confirmed that NHFP components should consist of stewardship
   (oversight), revenue collection, revenue pooling and risk management,
   resource allocation and purchasing of health services, health economics
   research, and development of human resources for health; over 68.8\%
   indicated cost-sharing, taxation and social health insurance as
   preferred revenue collection mechanisms; and 68.75\% indicated their
   preferred provider payment mechanism to be a global (lump sum) budget.
   Conclusion: This study succeeded in gathering the preliminary views of
   senior staff of selected Eritrean ministries and agencies regarding the
   likely elements of the NHFP, i.e. the vision, objectives, components,
   provider payment mechanisms, and health financing agency and its
   governance. In addition to stakeholder surveys, it would be helpful to
   inform the development of the NHFP with other pieces of evidence,
   including cost-effectiveness analysis of health services and
   interventions, financial feasibility analysis of financing options, a
   survey of the political and professional acceptability of financing
   options, national health accounts, and equity analyses.}},

Title = {{Do incentives, reminders or reduced burden improve healthcare
   professional response rates in postal questionnaires? two randomised
   controlled trials}},
Journal = {{BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{AUG 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Healthcare professional response rates to postal
   questionnaires are declining and this may threaten the validity and
   generalisability of their findings.
   Methods to improve response rates do incur costs (resources) and
   increase the cost of research projects. The aim of these randomised
   controlled trials (RCTs) was to assess whether 1) incentives, 2) type of
   reminder and/or 3) reduced response burden improve response rates; and
   to assess the cost implications of such additional effective
   interventions. Methods: Two RCTs were conducted. In RCT A general dental
   practitioners (dentists) in Scotland were randomised to receive either
   an incentive; an abridged questionnaire or a full length questionnaire.
   In RCT B non-responders to a postal questionnaire sent to general
   medical practitioners (GPs) in the UK were firstly randomised to receive
   a second full length questionnaire as a reminder or a postcard reminder.
   Continued non-responders from RCT B were then randomised within their
   first randomisation to receive a third full length or an abridged
   questionnaire reminder. The cost-effectiveness of interventions that
   effectively increased response rates was assessed as a secondary
   outcome.
   Results: There was no evidence that an incentive (52\% versus 43\%, Risk
   Difference (RD) -8.8 (95\%CI -22.5, 4.8); or abridged questionnaire
   (46\% versus 43\%, RD -2.9 (95\%CI -16.5, 10.7); statistically
   significantly improved dentist response rates compared to a full length
   questionnaire in RCT A. In RCT B there was no evidence that a full
   questionnaire reminder statistically significantly improved response
   rates compared to a postcard reminder (10.4\% versus 7.3\%, RD 3 (95\%
   CI -0.1, 6.8). At a second reminder stage, GPs sent the abridged
   questionnaire responded more often (14.8\% versus 7.2\%, RD -7.7 (95\%
   CI -12.8, -2.6). GPs who received a postcard reminder followed by an
   abridged questionnaire were most likely to respond (19.8\% versus 6.3\%,
   RD 8.1\%, and 9.1\% for full/postcard/full, three full or
   full/full/abridged questionnaire respectively). An abridged
   questionnaire containing fewer questions following a postcard reminder
   was the only cost-effective strategy for increasing the response rate
   (15.99 pound per response).
   Conclusions: When expecting or facing a low response rate to postal
   questionnaires, researchers should carefully identify the most efficient
   way to boost their response rate. In these studies, an abridged
   questionnaire containing fewer questions following a postcard reminder
   was the only cost-effective strategy. An increase in response rates may
   be explained by a combination of the number and type of contacts.
   Increasing the sampling frame may be more cost-effective than
   interventions to prompt non-responders. However, this may not strengthen
   the validity and generalisability of the survey findings and affect the
   representativeness of the sample.}},

Abstract = {{Study Objective: The current study presents findings from a qualitative
   examination of free text comments from a national survey of U.S.
   physicians on human papillomavirus vaccine recommendation beliefs and

   offer a more complete and physician-driven description of influences on
   human papillomavirus vaccine recommendation.
   Design and Participants: In 2009, a survey assessing physicians'
   knowledge, attitudes, and human papillomavirus vaccination practices was
   conducted among a national sample of U.S. physicians practicing Family
   Medicine, Pediatrics, or Obstetrics/Gynecology (response rate 67.8\%).
   Qualitative comments were analyzed using a Grounded Theory approach.
   Results: Of 1008 completed surveys, 112 participants provided comments,
   which were organized into three primary HPV vaccine-related themes: (a)
   comments about cost of the vaccine, (b) comments about institutional
   policies and procedures, and (c) physicians' personal views and one
   secondary theme related to survey methodology: the parent study's use of
   an upfront cash incentive. Many comments pertained to issues that were
   queried in the closed-end survey items; however, some comments provided
   insight into understudied areas (e.g., physician attitudes regarding
   survey methodology).
   Conclusion: Physician respondents used the free text space to
   reemphasize issues that were most important to them and to offer insight
   about aspects of the vaccine and the survey process.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Tobacco use is responsible for a considerable portion of
   the health disparities experienced by Blacks. In addition to its
   physiological effects, tobacco use has consistently been shown to be
   associated with suicidality among adolescents. The purpose of the
   present study is to describe the association between specific patterns
   of tobacco use behavior and those of suicidality among a nationally
   representative sample of Black high school students.
   Methods: Responses from Black adolescents (N = 2,931) who completed the
   2007 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey were included. Latent class
   analysis was utilized to identify typologies based on two domains: (a)
   lifetime and recent tobacco use and (b) suicidality. The association
   between tobacco use class membership and suicidality class membership as
   well as the direct effects of age and gender on class membership was
   also investigated.
   Results: A significant proportion of Black youth reported smoking and
   suicidal behaviors. A 4-class model provided the best overall fit to the
   data for tobacco use behavior (nonsmokers, former smokers, light current
   smokers, and frequent current smokers); a 3-class model provided the
   best overall fit to the data for suicidality (not suicidal, mild
   suicidality, suicidal). Smoking status was associated with suicidality
   class membership, with more intense patterns of smoking related to
   increased probability of identification with both mild suicidality and
   being classified as suicidal compared with not suicidal.
   Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that any current smoking
   status increases the likelihood of suicidality at least 5-fold and
   provides incentive to target this specific portion of the population of
   Black adolescent smokers.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{55}},

Pages = {{122-126}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objective. This study aimed to a) assess acceptability of personal
   financial incentives to socially disadvantaged smokers and non-smokers:
   b) examine factors associated with acceptability; and c) examine
   preferred levels of incentive amounts.
   Methods. A cross-sectional touch screen computer survey was conducted
   between February and October 2010 in New South Wales, Australia.
   Participants were clients experiencing financial or social hardship and
   receiving emergency welfare aid from a non-government social and
   community service organisation.
   Results. Of 383 participants (69\% response rate), 46\% believed
   personal financial incentives were an excellent/good idea, 47\% believed
   personal financial incentives did more good than harm and 61\% agreed
   they would motivate smokers to quit. High acceptability ratings were
   associated with participants being female, current smokers, living in
   low socioeconomic areas, experiencing smoking-induced deprivation,
   making a previous quit attempt and intending to quit in the next 6
   months. When asked what amount of incentive they felt would be
   acceptable, 23\% selected amounts between \$50 and \$500AUD and 37\%
   selected amounts over \$500AUD.
   Conclusions. Given high smoking prevalence among socially disadvantaged
   groups and consequent health disparities, it is imperative novel methods
   of encouraging smoking cessation are explored and tested. This survey
   found financial incentives may be an acceptable method. Further research
   to understand all possible positive and negative effects is warranted.

Title = {{Medical student characteristics predictive of intent for rural practice}},
Journal = {{RURAL AND REMOTE HEALTH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUL-SEP}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: The shortage of physicians in rural areas of the USA has
   led medical schools to focus on recruiting and selecting students who
   will choose to work in non-urban settings. The purpose of this study was
   to examine the effect of student characteristics previously correlated
   to choosing rural practice (ie being older, being male, being raised in
   a rural community, having a spouse or significant other who was raised
   in a rural community, having a spouse or significant other whose parents
   live in a rural community, having parents with high school education or
   less, and graduating from a smaller college) on osteopathic medical
   students' intent to practice in a rural setting. This study also
   examined the correlation between personality type and intent for rural
   practice using the Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). Finally, this
   study examined factors that would increase interest in practicing in a
   rural setting, such as financial assistance and students' opinions about
   physicians who choose to practice in rural areas.
   Methods: The study participants were students in a new osteopathic
   medical school with an enrollment of 225. Cross-sectional survey data
   were collected on background characteristics and intent for rural
   practice. Retrospective data were collected from MBTI assessments
   previously completed as part of routine career planning educational
   sessions. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics such as
   frequencies, percentages and inferential statistics such as chi(2) and
   logistic regression.
   Results: A total of 141 students participated, a 63\% response rate.
   Factors associated with intent to practice rural medicine included being
   raised in a rural area for more than half of one's life (p<0.0 5) and
   having a spouse or significant other who had lived in a rural area
   (p<0.0 5). Age, sex, race, and size of undergraduate college were not
   associated with intent to practice rural medicine. Students categorized
   as Extraverted based on the MBTI were more likely to have intent for
   rural practice even when other factors were controlled. Students
   reported that financial incentives and wage guarantees may increase
   interest in rural practice.
   Conclusion: The results of this study support past research showing that
   medical students with a rural background and with spouses or significant
   others having a rural background are more likely to have intent for
   rural practice. This study also found that students' personality types
   may be correlated with intent to practice in a rural area. In order to

Abstract = {{Background: A founding principle of hospice is that the patient and
   family is the unit of care; however, we lack national information on
   services to family members. Although Medicare certification requires
   bereavement services be provided, reimbursement rates are not tied to
   the level or quality of care; therefore, limited financial incentives
   exist for hospice to provide more than a minimal benefit.
   Objectives: To assess the scope and intensity of services provided to
   family members by hospice.
   Research Design: We fielded a national survey of hospices between
   September 2008 and November 2009.
   Participants: A national sample of US hospices with an 84\% response
   rate (N=591).
   Measures: Bereavement services to the family, bereavement services to
   the community, labor-intensive family services, and comprehensive family
   services.
   Results: Most hospices provided bereavement services to the family
   (78\%) and to the community (76\%), but only a minority of hospices
   provided labor-intensive (23\%) or comprehensive (27\%) services to
   grieving family members. Larger hospice size was positively and
   significantly associated with each of the 4 measures of family services.
   We found no significant difference in provision of bereavement services
   to the family, labor-intensive services, or comprehensive services by
   ownership type; however, nonprofit hospices were more likely than
   for-profit hospices to provide bereavement services to the community.
   Conclusions: Our results show substantial diversity in the scope and
   intensity of services provided to families of patients with terminal
   illnesses, suggesting a need for clearer guidance on what hospices
   should provide to exemplify best practices. Consensus within the field
   on more precise guidelines in this area is essential.}},

Abstract = {{In the United States, multipartnered fertility (MPF) has become
   commonplace. This study provides the first nationally representative
   measures of women's MPF, across multiple years, using the U.S. Census
   Bureau's Surveys of Income and Program Participation. Because welfare
   rules contain strong incentives for MPF, and because MPF is especially
   common among welfare recipients, the authors also examine the
   relationship between welfare and MPF. Focusing on the pre-TANF period
   1985 to 1996, when welfare rules were more comparable across states and
   the absence of time limits made the incentives for MPF larger, the
   authors find little behavioral response. Among low-income mothers, MPF
   does not appear to be driven by program design. Because the incentives
   were relatively large and reached well up the income distribution, the
   findings amplify those of earlier studies that show little demographic
   response to antipoverty programs and invite reconsideration of how much
   these incentives should constrain transfer programs that target
   children.}},

   training centres}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},

Month = {{JUN 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: The participation of trainers and trainees in health
   research is critical to advance medical science. Overcoming barriers and
   enhancing incentives are essential to sustain a research culture and
   extend the frontiers of medical education. In this study, we
   investigated the roles of individual and system factors influencing
   trainee resident participation in health research in Enugu,
   south-eastern Nigeria.
   Methods: This cross-sectional survey of trainee residents was conducted
   across three residency training centres in Enugu, Nigeria, between
   February and March, 2010. The number and speciality distribution of
   trainee residents were determined from personnel records at each centre.
   A 19-item questionnaire was used to record demographic characteristics,
   research training/experience, and attitudes toward and perceived
   barriers to health research. Data were analysed to yield frequencies,
   percentages and proportions. Values of p < 0.05 were considered
   significant.
   Results: The response rate was 93.2\%. The respondents (n = 136)
   comprised 109 males and 27 females. Their mean +/- standard deviation
   age was 35.8 +/- 5.6 years (range: 25-53 years). Participation in
   research was significantly associated with previous research training
   {[}odds ratio (OR): 2.90; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.35-6.25, p =
   0.003, beta = 22.57], previous research participation (OR: 2.21; 95\%
   CI: 0.94-5.29, p = 0.047, beta = 22.53) and research publication (OR:
   2.63; 95\% CI: 1.00-7.06, p = 0.03, beta = 22.57). Attitude towards
   research was significantly influenced by perceived usefulness of
   research in patient care (OR: 7.10; 95\% CI: 3.33-15.13, p = 0.001), job
   promotion (OR: 8.97; 95\% CI: 4.12-19.53, p = 0.001) and better
   understanding of disease (OR: 21.37; 95\% CI: 8.71-54.44, p = 0.001).
   Time constraints (OR: 0.06; 95\% CI = 0.025-0.14, p = 0.001), funding
   (OR: 0.028; 95\% CI: 0.008-0.10, p = 0.001) and mentorship (OR: 0.086;
   95\% CI: 0.36-0.21, p = 0.001) were significant barriers to research
   participation.
   Conclusions: System and individual factors are significant incentives to
   research participation, while system-derived factors are significant
   barriers. Pre-residency research, dedicated research time, adequate
   research funding and commensurate research mentorship rewards are
   instructive. Prospective longitudinal studies are warranted to confirm
   these findings.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: The study aims to describe the meal time and parent communication
   practices used in South Australian Long Day Care Centres (LDCCs) and
   explore whether practices differ by engagement in a nutrition incentive
   award scheme, Start Right-Eat Right. Methods: One hundred eighty-four
   staff from South Australian LDCCs (81\% response rate) completed a
   16-item telephone survey. Open and closed questions were asked, with
   multiple unprompted responses accepted for open questions. Differences
   by Start Right-Eat Right status (engaged vs not-engaged) were determined
   using chi-square analysis. Results: Sitting and supervising children
   while eating (100\%), offering meals (98\%) and snacks (94\%) at regular
   and predictable intervals, and discussing food served with children
   (88\%) were common mealtime practices. Practices that involved children
   at mealtimes were also frequent. Engaged centres reported higher
   frequencies of staff role modelling (80\% vs 56\%, P= 0.004) and
   encouraging children to taste foods offered (33\% vs 13\%, P= 0.021).
   Centres reported using sometimes foods (76\%) and food alternatives
   (42\%) to celebrate children's birthdays, with more engaged centres than
   not-engaged centres using nutritious foods at celebrations (15\% vs 6\%,
   P= 0.045). While 59\% of respondents indicated that nutrition can be a
   sensitive topic to discuss with families, over 90\% indicated it is
   important to communicate with parents about nutrition and felt confident
   to do so. Conclusion: Practices employed by South Australian LDCCs to
   create a positive mealtime environment were consistent with current
   guidelines, more so when centres are engaged in a nutrition award
   scheme.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The need to adapt to climate change impacts, whilst simultaneously
   limiting greenhouse gas emissions, requires that the government's
   efforts are joined by public action. In England and Wales, housing
   contributes significantly to the emissions and many properties are at
   risk of flooding. This paper investigates the preparedness of homeowners
   in England and Wales to make changes to their homes in response to the
   predicted effects of climate change. A telephone survey of 961
   homeowners investigated their interest in purchasing mitigation and
   adaptation improvements against their concern about climate change,
   awareness of flood risk and attribution of responsibility for action.
   Whilst the majority of homes had some energy-saving improvements, few
   were found to have property-level flood protection. The high levels of
   awareness about climate change and flooding were coupled with the
   perception of risks as low. Whilst some respondents accepted personal
   responsibility for action, most believed that the authorities were
   responsible for flood protection, and would not pay the costs required
   to make their home more energy-efficient and better prepared for the
   eventuality of floods. The results suggest that there is scope for
   further improvement of energy-saving measures, and that the levels of
   adoption of flood-protection measures are very low. Multi-faceted
   strategies, including more effective communication of risks and
   responsibilities, incentives, and material support for the poorest, will
   need to be developed to overcome the current reluctance by homeowners to
   invest in flood-protection measures and further energy conservation
   solutions in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Consumer ethnocentrism presents barriers for internationalising

   that, as accurate measures of actual purchasing behaviour, suffer from
   certain methodological issues. In response, we report an experiment that
   measures the ethnocentrism of 447 Chinese consumers as their
   incentive-compatible choices between foreign and domestic products in a

Journal = {{TRANSPORT POLICY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{21}},
Pages = {{52-62}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{On-board survey is one of the most common survey methods utilized on
   transit units like buses to obtain vital information regarding customer
   trip characteristics, travel behavior, demographic characteristics, and
   customers' attitude toward services. The quantity and the quality of
   data collected through on-board surveys are very critical and often are
   a major concern for transit systems because survey results are used for
   current or future route planning, modeling, etc. Thus, applying
   appropriate survey techniques for on-board surveys is crucial to
   collecting the required amount of data to fulfill the transit system's
   current and future needs without survey cost and time overruns. This
   study tested three different on-board survey techniques to
   quantitatively evaluate the effects of each technique on the overall
   response rate and unit cost. These three tests are (a) length of
   questionnaire, (b) incentives, and (c) surveyors. The tests were
   conducted on selected routes of the Tulsa Transit System. The test
   results indicate that different combinations of techniques will result
   in different response rates and unit costs. Thus, good planning and
   piloting tests for the different on-board survey techniques, and
   appropriate interpretations of the pilot test results, are crucial to
   acquiring the expected performance of the main survey while staying
   within budget. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{APR 19}},
Abstract = {{Background: The quality of data collected in survey research is usually
   indicated by the response rate; the representativeness of the sample,
   and; the rate of completed questions (item-response). In attempting to
   improve a generally declining response rate in surveys considerable
   efforts are being made through follow-up mailings and various types of
   incentives. This study examines effects of including a scratch lottery
   ticket in the invitation letter to a survey.
   Method: Questionnaires concerning oral health were mailed to a random
   sample of 2,400 adults. A systematically selected half of the sample
   (1,200 adults) received a questionnaire including a scratch lottery
   ticket. One reminder without the incentive was sent.
   Results: The incentive increased the response rate and improved
   representativeness by reaching more respondents with lower education.
   Furthermore, it reduced item nonresponse. The initial incentive had no
   effect on the propensity to respond after the reminder.
   Conclusion: When attempting to improve survey data, three issues become
   important: response rate, representativeness, and item-response. This
   study shows that including a scratch lottery ticket in the invitation
   letter performs well on all the three.}},

Abstract = {{It is often of interest to elicit beliefs from populations that may
   include nave participants. Unfortunately, elicitation mechanisms are
   typically assessed by assuming optimal responses to incentives. Using
   laboratory experiments with a population that potentially includes nave
   participants, we compare the performance of two elicitation mechanisms
   proposed by Karni (Econometrica 77(2):603-606, 2009). These mechanisms,
   denoted as ``declarative{''} and ``clock,{''} are valuable because their
   incentive compatibility does not require strong assumptions such as risk
   neutrality or expected utility maximization. We show that, theoretically
   and empirically, with a sufficient fraction of nave participants, the
   clock mechanism elicits beliefs more accurately than the declarative.
   The source of this accuracy advantage is twofold: the clock censors nave
   responses, and participants are more likely to employ dominant
   strategies under the clock. Our findings hold practical value to anyone
   interested in eliciting beliefs from representative populations, a goal
   of increasing importance when conducting large-scale surveys or field

Abstract = {{Private landowners play a pivotal role in determining whether or not
   rare species persist in regions where privately owned land is extensive.
   The range of the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) is confined to
   the Southeastern U.S., a region predominantly under private ownership,
   and thus the status of this species is largely dependent upon land
   management decisions made by private landowners. We sent an anonymous
   mail survey to 2,584 individuals to examine factors affecting gopher
   tortoise occurrence on private lands in Mississippi (adjusted response
   rate of 23\%). Few respondents (19\%) reported currently having
   tortoises on their property, although many had them in the past (30\%).
   Tortoises were persisting primarily on larger properties with longleaf
   pine that were not managed chiefly for timber production. In general,
   respondents were largely unaware of habitat requirements of tortoises or
   effects of various land management practices on them, and few reported
   using management techniques that benefit tortoises, such as prescribed
   burning. Most respondents (57\%) knew of wildlife incentive programs,
   but were hesitant to enroll because they did not want to commit to
   managing their property in a particular manner (34\%). We suggest
   actions that could improve the likelihood of tortoise persistence in
   this region, as well as changes that could be made to incentive programs
   to increase landowner participation. These suggestions should be
   relevant to the conservation of other rare species on private lands in
   other regions.}},

Volume = {{148}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Stewardship programs providing financial incentives for conservation on
   private lands are increasingly common. We estimate the potential costs
   of a stewardship program in the Daly River catchment, Northern
   Territory, which would underwrite the cost difference between routine
   land management and the additional requirements of conservation
   management on grazing properties. Based on survey responses from
   landholders, we first assess the current costs of land management in the
   catchment and use regression to identify key drivers of spatial
   variation in both routine land management costs and
   conservation-oriented management costs. We define conservation-oriented
   management costs as the costs required to meet objectives for both
   routine property management and conservation. We then estimate the
   additional costs of conservation management over and above routine land
   management at an average of \$1.99 per ha. We conclude that, if the most
   cost-effective properties are targeted, an annual budget of \$1 million
   would support stewardship agreements covering 90\% of the catchment's
   area. Much of the cost-effectiveness of stewardship payments would come
   from the significant economies of scale in managing large pastoral
   properties and leveraging the costs of routine land management already
   met by landholders. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Getting physicians to open the survey: little evidence that an envelope
   teaser increases response rates}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{MAR 31}},
Abstract = {{Background: Physician surveys are an important tool to assess attitudes,
   beliefs and self-reported behaviors of this policy relevant group. In
   order for a physician to respond to a mailed survey, they must first
   open the envelope. While there is some evidence that package elements
   can impact physician response rates, the impact of an envelope teaser is
   unknown. Here we assess this by testing the impact of adding a brightly
   colored ``\$25 incentive{''} sticker to the outside of an envelope on
   response rates and nonresponse bias in a survey of physicians.
   Methods: In the second mailing of a survey assessing physicians' moral
   beliefs and views on controversial health care topics, initial
   nonrespondents were randomly assigned to receive a survey in an envelope
   with a colored ``\$25 incentive{''} sticker (teaser group) or an
   envelope without a sticker (control group). Response rates were compared
   between the teaser and control groups overall and by age, gender, region
   of the United States, specialty and years in practice. Nonresponse bias
   was assessed by comparing the demographic composition of the respondents
   to the nonrespondents in the experimental and control condition.
   Results: No significant differences in response rates were observed
   between the experimental and control conditions overall (p = 0.38) or
   after stratifying by age, gender, region, or practice type. Within the
   teaser condition, there was some variation in response rate by years
   since graduation. There was no independent effect of the teaser on
   response when simultaneously controlling for demographic characteristics
   (OR = 0.875, p = 0.4112).
   Conclusions: Neither response rates nor nonresponse bias were impacted
   by the use of an envelope teaser in a survey of physicians in the United
   States.}},

Pages = {{230-234}},
Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{Purpose. To examine associations between pay for performance (P4P) and
   recommended cessation counseling among primary care practices (PCPs).
   Design. Cross-sectional survey of 89 PCPs participating in a joint
   Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF)-Agency for Healthcare Research and
   Quality (AHRQ) health promotion initiative.
   Setting and Participants. 100\% response rate from PCPs participating in
   the RWJF-AHRQ
   Measures. Survey data on cessation counseling, practice involvement with
   P4P, practice size, public reporting of performance, practice
   competition, linkages with community resources, integration of
   evidence-based guidelines, patient recommendations for cessation, and
   state-specific smoking rates.
   Analysis. Logistic regression was used to examine associations between
   practice involvement with P4P and cessation counseling offered by PCPs.
   Practice characteristics, including size and availability of other
   cessation services, were included in the analysis.
   Results. Practices that were involved with P4P had greater odds of
   offering recommended cessation counseling (odds ratio {[}OR] = 27.6, p <
   .01). Practices that linked patients to community resources, experienced
   greater competition, and were larger in size also provided more
   counseling (p < .05). Publicly reporting performance information and
   being located in states with higher smoking rates were associated with
   decreased odds of offering counseling support (p < .10).
   Conclusions. Findings suggest that P4P is associated with recommended
   counseling for smoking cessation. Study limitations include small sample
   size and unavailability of information on the magnitude of P4P
   incentives and program design. Further analysis considering these
   programmatic details is warranted. (Am J Health Promot

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{81}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: This study examined the current prevalence of electronic health
   records (EHRs) in Korea and identified the factors that impede or
   facilitate the adoption of EHRs.
   Methods: We surveyed all tertiary teaching and general hospitals in
   Korea. The degree to which EHR systems were adopted was evaluated using
   the previously defined definitions of `comprehensive' and `basic' EHRs
   based on their electronic functionality. The effects of teaching status,
   size, and location of hospitals on EHR adoption were examined. We also
   investigated factors that impeded or facilitated the adoption of EHR
   systems.
   Results: The response rate was 39.0\% (122/313), and 37.2\% (95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI] 31.9-42.6\%) of Korean tertiary teaching and
   general hospitals had either basic or comprehensive EHR systems (50.2\%
   of tertiary teaching hospitals, 35.0\% of general hospitals). However,
   only 5.0\% (CI 2.6-7.4\%) had comprehensive EHR systems. Most Korean
   tertiary teaching and general hospitals, i.e., 87.0\% (95\% CI,
   83.3-90.7\%), have implemented computerized provider order-entry (CPOE)
   systems for medications, with larger hospitals more likely than smaller
   ones to have adopted some sort of EHRs (p-value < 0.001). However, the
   prevalence of these systems did not differ according to the location of
   the hospital (metropolitan vs. non-metropolitan). According to the
   survey data, the capital requirements and high maintenance costs of EHR
   systems were the major barriers to their adoption, and government
   reimbursement or incentives were the most requested facilitators of
   their adoption.
   Conclusion: The rate at which EHR and CPOE for medications systems have
   been adopted by Korean tertiary teaching and general hospitals was
   higher than the rate of adoption by US hospitals. Financial aspects are
   reported to be the most important facilitators of and barriers to EHR
   adoption. Government financial support, especially to small hospitals,
   seems to be essential to promoting the adoption of EHRs by Korean
   hospitals. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: We described the demographic, clinical, and attitudinal
   profiles of patients awaiting magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at a
   private and at a hospital-based facility, and hypothesized that they
   would not differ significantly.
   Methods: A survey of patients attending a hospital facility and a
   privately owned venue in an Ontario city. Descriptive, bivariate, and
   logistic regression analyses were performed.
   Results: A total of 314 patients provided data, with a higher response
   rate at the private clinic than at the hospital-based clinic (97\% vs
   60\%). For the majority of patients (58\%), the MRI was scheduled to
   follow up known disease; 55.8\% waited more than 4 weeks; 6.4\% waited
   more than 6 months. One-third of patients expressed a willingness to
   travel to the United States and pay for the MRI, 41\% expressed a
   willingness to pay within Ontario, and 66\% were willing to travel
   elsewhere in Ontario. They were more likely to be at the hospital-based
   MRI if they were being followed up for known disease and had a diagnosis
   of cancer, whereas those patients at the private MRI facility reported
   significantly more pain; 59\% of the hospital-based sample and 72\% of
   the private clinic sample reported significantly reduced quality of life
   because of their health problem.
   Discussion: These data provide interesting insights into the
   characteristics of patients awaiting an MRI and the attitudes of
   patients towards public and private MRI clinics. There were significant
   attitudinal differences between those patients attending the 2
   facilities. Pain, coupled with a long wait, may create an incentive for
   patients to conclude that private clinics should be permitted if the

Pages = {{296-302}},
Abstract = {{Disposal of sputum from patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) who
   are treated at home is an important aspect of preventing the spread of
   TB. However, few studies have examined disposal of sputum by patients
   with TB who are treated at home. Patients with pulmonary TB who are
   treated at home were surveyed regarding sputum handling and supervision.
   A cross-sectional survey of a representative sample of patients with
   pulmonary TB who are treated at home was conducted in Shandong Province.
   Participants were individuals with TB who had been registered with a
   local agency responsible for TB control. Participants completed a
   questionnaire with both qualitative and quantitative questions. How
   sputum was handled was determined and factors associated with sputum
   disposal were analyzed using a non-parametric test, logistic regression,
   and content analysis. Responses were received from 720 participants.
   Patients expectorated sputum 4.56 +/- 10.367 times a day, and 68.6\% of
   patients responded that they correctly disposed of their sputum.
   Supervision as part of TB control focused on the efforts of health
   agencies and paid little attention to waste management by patients. A
   non-parametric test showed that sputum disposal was significantly
   associated with gender, age, education, sputum smear results, attitudes
   toward waste management, and attitudes toward supervision (all p <
   0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that gender (OR = 0.482, 95\%
   CI: 0.329-0.704), sputum smear results (OR = 1.300, 95\% CI:
   1.037-1.629), and level of education (OR = 0.685, 95\% CI: 0.528-0.889)
   were associated with receipt of TB health education (all p < 0.05).
   Sputum handling by and supervision of patients with pulmonary TB who are
   treated at home is severely wanting. From a policy perspective, special
   attention should be given to the definition, details, and methods of
   supervision of waste management by patients with TB to give them
   relevant health education and enhance their willingness to be
   supervised. A financial incentive should be provided to health workers
   supervising management of TB-related waste.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - Environmental sustainability literature provides extensive
   evidence that business organizations, societies, and governments all
   have a stake in green operations management. Despite the importance of a
   firm's effort to alleviate environmental damages and provide economic
   benefits to organizations, little is known about the external
   institutional drivers that enable firms to adopt internal proactive
   environmental strategies. This purpose of this study is to examine the
   extent to which an internal proactive environmental strategy
   (eco-design) and external institutional drivers (government regulations
   and incentives, customer pressures) motivate firms to adopt eco-deigns
   that influence environmental performance.
   Design/methodology/approach - Hypotheses are tested using data from a
   sample of 132 EMS ISO 14001 - certified manufacturing firms in Malaysia.
   Specifically, this study uses survey data to validate the major premises
   in our proposed model.
   Findings - Empirical tests of the hypotheses with structural equation
   modeling (SEM) support the posited explanation that external
   institutional drivers influence a firm's environmental performance both
   directly and indirectly through its internal proactive environmental
   strategy. These findings extend prior research by establishing the
   importance of the relationships among regulations/incentives, customer
   pressures, eco-designs, and environmental performance.
   Research limitations/implications - Although the research design
   incorporates extensive literature reviews, it does not capture every
   aspect of underlying constructs characteristics. Future efforts should
   establish a valid, reliable instrument for these constructs.
   Practical implications - This research provides rigorous empirical
   support of the contribution of eco-design to environmental performance.
   This finding helps managers recognize how to leverage their internally
   developed eco-designs capabilities by responding to external pressures
   and institutional concerns. The response to external institutional
   pressures provides a basis for creating an inimitable eco-design
   resource base, which is critical to environmental sustainability.
   Originality/value - This study examines a key factor, eco-design, that
   may transmit the influence of regulations/incentives and customer
   pressures to firm's environmental performance. The findings provide
   strong support for the main thesis, as well as valuable insights about
   predictors of firm environmental performance.}},

Title = {{A 10-Year Survey of US Deans: Trends, Challenges, and Mentoring in
   Prosthodontics. Part 2}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Part 2 of this survey reports on the 2009 survey findings
   distributed to the deans of US dental schools. A national, electronic
   survey of 58 dental school deans was distributed by e-mail to evaluate
   an interest in specialty training, an interest in specialty training in
   prosthodontics, faculty shortage issues, predoctoral curriculum in
   prosthodontics, ideology regarding dental specialties, and the
   administrative position of prosthodontics within the schools.
   Materials and Methods: The survey data were transferred to an online
   spreadsheet program for statistical analysis (Key Survey, Inc.
   www.keysurvey.com, Braintree, MA). The opinions of dental school deans
   were viewed as legitimate indicators of change within predoctoral and
   postdoctoral prosthodontic education. Statistical analysis was carried
   out using Statistica Version 9.1 (Statsoft, Tulsa, OK).
   Results: Of the 58 deans, 42 deans responded, for a 72.4\% response
   rate. Twenty-three deans reported an increase in the number of students
   seeking specialty training after dental school. Only three deans
   reported a decrease in those seeking specialty training. In the 2009
   survey, 45\% the deans responded that there was an increased interest in
   prosthodontics. One or more open faculty positions in prosthodontics
   existed at 24 (59\%) of the dental schools, and 30 (71\%) offered at
   least one incentive or a variety of incentives to recruit faculty. The
   2009 respondents to the deans' survey revealed predoctoral student
   exposure to prosthodontists was high, and exposure to advanced education
   in prosthodontics students was low. A survey of internal school programs
   that might have an impact on an increased interest in prosthodontics
   revealed the presence of a predoctoral mentoring program for
   prosthodontics in 36 (88\%) of the institutions. The clinical curriculum
   included treatment of a variety of cases including complex cases as
   defined by a diagnostic classification system. The 2009 survey
   respondents reported an increase in the number of schools where
   prosthodontics is a separate entity or department.
   Conclusion: Deans reported an increased interest in prosthodontics in
   the 2009 survey. Open faculty positions in prosthodontics existed in the
   majority of dental schools, and most schools offered incentives to
   recruit faculty. The survey of deans found a very high level of exposure
   of dental students to full-time prosthodontists and a very low exposure
   level to students enrolled in advanced education in prosthodontics. The
   establishment of mentoring programs in prosthodontics was reported by
   most deans, and the predoctoral curriculum included treating complex
   cases. Most deans stated that dual-specialty training in prosthodontics
   and periodontics would be beneficial. The 2009 survey reported an
   increase in the number of departments of prosthodontics in US schools.}},

Abstract = {{When considering householder responses to flood risk, researchers and

   perceptions and concerns about material costs and benefits. Using
   secondary analysis of survey data from UK households who had experienced
   flooding or who were at risk of flooding, this paper presents evidence
   to suggest that protective behaviour may be influenced less by material
   and financial considerations than by concerns about feelings of anxiety
   and insecurity. It also looks at the role of beliefs about protection
   and flooding in mediating the impacts of flood experience and suggests
   that experience reduces confidence in the ameliorative capacity of
   insurance and promotes the belief that protective measures increase
   anxiety about flooding. The paper concludes that more research should be
   carried out on the role of anticipated emotions in risk response and
   that policy makers and the designers of protection products should pay
   more attention to the emotional barriers and incentives to adaptation.}},

Abstract = {{Economic modelling generally assumes that businesses are profit
   maximisers. However, behavioural economics holds that businesses pursue
   multiple objectives and may even sacrifice some profit. This has
   implications for the effectiveness of incentive-based environmental
   policies. Using Danish farmers as a case, this paper examines whether
   non-economic rationales may trump economic ones in farmer decisions,
   and, unlike previous research, we quantify how widespread non-economic
   values are compared to more economic values. Data derive from a survey
   (1164 responses) of Danish conventional farmers' decision rationales
   regarding their use of pesticides. Using cluster analysis, we show that
   some farmers are more economically motivated while other farmers are
   more focused on optimising yield and pay less attention to expenditures
   and crop prices. Furthermore, we find that the two groups differ in
   their response to policy instruments; farmers who focus on yield
   indicate less responsiveness to economic policy instruments. The results
   imply that it is important to implement a broad array of policy
   instruments to match different farmer rationales.}},

Title = {{Offering Results to Participants in a Diabetes Survey Effects on Survey
   Response Rates}},
Journal = {{PATIENT-PATIENT CENTERED OUTCOMES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{241-245}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: There are many reasons why an investigator may choose to
   share results with survey respondents; however, the practice is not
   universal. Moreover, while there is some evidence that the practice
   increases response rates, it is of limited generalizability.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to determine both the impact on
   survey response rates of offering study results to participants, and the
   extent to which surveyed individuals with diabetes mellitus want results
   reported back from a postal questionnaire.
   Methods: In November-December 2009, we surveyed 4796 randomly selected
   individuals from a US Midwestern health system diabetes registry. Half
   of the sample was randomized to receive an offer of survey results as an
   incentive. Response rates were compared across the two groups. Within
   the group offered results, we compared those that requested them with
   those that declined with respect to demographic characteristics,
   self-reported diabetes severity, and characterization of care received
   for diabetes.
   Results: The overall response rate was 42.8\% (n = 2055). Offering
   survey results did not impact response rates overall or within specific
   subpopulations. Of those randomized to the offer of results, 62.1\%
   requested the results (n = 618). Requests for results differed by
   educational attainment and the rating of diabetes care as poor, although
   only education remained a significant predictor in multivariate
   analysis. There were no differences in rates of requests by disease
   severity or overall health status.
   Conclusion: Offering survey results to potential respondents did not
   increase the likelihood of response among a patient population with
   diabetes. Of those that were offered results and returned the survey,
   62.1\% requested that they receive study results, indicating a
   potentially important educational opportunity. However, as result
   requests were driven more by educational attainment than by health
   status, investigators may want to send results to everyone, not just
   those that request them.}},

   independent regulator is the most important institutional determinant of
   best practice regulation. In addition, small numbers of network
   companies act as a constraint on the use of advanced benchmarking
   methods. Finally, regional effects are also important. These findings

Abstract = {{Little is known about what strategies are cost-effective in increasing

   prenotification (none, prenotification letter only, or prenotification
   letter containing a \$2 preincentive). Results indicated that the
   response rates were highest in the groups promised \$100 and \$50,
   respectively. While the postal prenotification letter increased response
   rates, the inclusion of a small token \$2 preincentive had no effect on
   participation. Further, unlike mail surveys of physicians, the \$2
   preincentive was not cost-effective. Among physicians, larger promised
   incentives of \$50 or \$100 are more effective than a nominal

   small financial incentives were found to be effective in improving nurse
   survey participation. Token nonmonetary incentives, in contrast, were
   much less effective. In terms of design strategies, postal and telephone
   strategies have generally been more successful than have fax or
   web-based approaches, with evidence also supporting use of mixed-mode
   surveys in this population. In addition, use of first-class stamps on

   Providers: The Role of Geographic and Demographic Factors}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{This study investigates the effects of non-response bias in a 2010
   postal survey assessing experiences with H1N1 influenza vaccine
   administration among a diverse sample of providers (N = 765) in
   Washington state. Though we garnered a high response rate (80.9\%) by
   using evidence-based survey design elements, including intensive
   follow-up and a gift card incentive from Target, non-response bias could
   exist if there were differences between respondents and non-respondents.
   We investigated differences between the two groups for seven variables:
   road distance to the nearest Target store, practice type, previous
   administration of vaccines, region, urbanicity, size of practice, and
   Vaccines for Children (VFC) program enrollment. We also examined the
   effect of non-response bias on survey estimates. Statistically
   significant differences between respondents and non-respondents were
   found for four variables: miles to the nearest Target store, type of
   medical practice, whether the practice routinely administered additional
   vaccines besides H1N1, and urbanicity. Practices were more likely to
   respond if they were from a small town or rural area (OR = 7.68, 95\% CI
   = 1.44-40.88), were a non-traditional vaccine provider type (OR = 2.08,
   95\% CI = 1.06-4.08) or a pediatric provider type (OR = 4.03, 95\% CI =
   1.36-11.96), or administered additional vaccines besides H1N1 (OR =
   1.80, 95\% CI = 1.03-3.15). Of particular interest, for each ten mile
   increase in road distance from the nearest Target store, the likelihood
   of provider response decreased (OR = 0.73, 95\% CI = 0.60-0.89). Of
   those variables associated with response, only small town or rural
   practice location was associated with a survey estimate of interest,
   suggesting that non-response bias had a minimal effect on survey
   estimates. These findings show that gift card incentives alongside
   survey design elements and follow-up can achieve high response rates.
   However, there is evidence that practices farther from the nearest place
   to redeem gift cards may be less likely to respond to the survey.}},

Title = {{An Experimental Study of the Effects of Monetary Incentives on
   Performance on the 12th-Grade NAEP Reading Assessment}},
Journal = {{TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{113}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2309-2344}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background/context: The National Assessment of Educational Progress
   (NAEP) is the only comparative assessment of academic competencies
   regularly administered to nationally representative samples of students
   enrolled in Grades 4, 8, and 12. Because NAEP is a low-stakes
   assessment, there are long-standing questions about the level of
   engagement and effort of the 12th graders who participate in the
   assessment and, consequently, about the validity of the reported
   results.
   Purpose/Focus: This study investigated the effects of monetary
   incentives on the performance of 12th graders on a reading assessment
   closely modeled on the NAEP reading test in order to evaluate the
   likelihood that scores obtained at regular administrations underestimate
   student capabilities.
   Population: The study assessed more than 2,600 students in a convenience
   sample of 59 schools in seven states. The schools are heterogeneous with
   respect to demographics and type of location.
   Intervention: There were three conditions: a control and two incentive
   interventions. For the fixed incentive, students were offered \$20 at
   the start of the session. For the contingent incentive, students were
   offered \$5 in advance and \$15 for correct responses to each of two
   randomly chosen questions, for a maximum payout of \$35. All students
   were administered one of eight booklets comprising two reading blocks (a
   passage with associated questions) and a background questionnaire. All
   reading blocks were operational blocks released by NAEP.
   Research Design: This was a randomized controlled field trial. Students
   agreed to participate without knowing that monetary incentives would be
   offered. Random allocation to condition was conducted independently in
   each school.
   Data Collection/Analysis: Regular NAEP contractors administered the
   assessments and carried out preliminary data processing. Scaling of
   results and linking to the NAEP reporting scale were conducted using
   standard NAEP procedures.
   Findings: Monetary incentives have a statistically significant and
   substantively important impact on both student engagement/effort and
   performance overall, and for most subgroups defined by gender, race, and
   background characteristics. For both males and females, the effect of
   the contingent incentive was more than 5 NAEP score points,
   corresponding to one quarter of the difference in the average scores
   between Grades 8 and 12. In general, the effect of the contingent
   incentive was larger than that of the fixed incentive, particularly for
   lower scoring subgroups.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: There is now credible evidence that NAEP
   may both underestimate the reading abilities of students enrolled in
   12th grade and yield biased estimates of certain achievement gaps.
   Responsible officials should take this into account as they plan changes
   to the NAEP reading framework and expand the scope of the 12th-grade
   assessment survey.}},

   Methods: This descriptive, nonexperimental, cross-sectional study was

   distributed to 790 second-and third-year student pharmacists to measure
   interest, opinions, and perceived barriers in providing HC services.
   Results: 502 survey responses (63.5\% response rate) were received.
   Student pharmacists reported interest in providing HC services (96.2\%)
   to both minors and adults (53.3\%), adults (40.6\%), or minors (6.2\%).
   Students felt that patients would benefit from improved access and
   advice (94.0\%). Inadequate pharmacist time was deemed an extremely
   important barrier in determining whether pharmacists could efficiently
   and effectively provide HC services, followed by lack of private
   counseling area in the pharmacy, inadequate patient health information,
   and lack of appropriate incentive structure. Students were interested in
   providing other reproductive health services, specifically preventive
   measures against sexually transmitted infections (STIs; 89.2\%) and STI
   treatment for the partners of patients presenting with valid STI

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Insight into motivating factors and barriers for blood
   donation, especially for young people and underrepresented minorities,
   is important to donor recruitment and retention. We surveyed donors at a
   new blood collection facility based on a large, ethnically diverse
   university campus.
   STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Individuals who had donated or attempted to
   donate at the facility during the first 17 months of its operation were
   invited by e-mail to respond to an anonymous, Web-based questionnaire.
   Respondents were asked to provide demographic characteristics, rate the
   importance of various motivating and deterring factors for blood
   donation, and indicate how they prefer to be contacted by the blood
   center.
   RESULTS: More than 30\% of the 1619 invitees responded, 95.6\% (n = 479)
   of whom gave complete responses. The respondents were ethnically
   diverse, and 79.1\% were between 18 and 28 years of age. Altruism was by
   far the most important motivating factor for donation. However,
   incentives were also rated as important or very important by 72.2\% of
   the respondents. Inconvenience due to time or location constraints was
   the most important deterrent. E-mailing was the most preferred contact
   method and chosen by 80.3\% of those surveyed. Some differences were
   noted in the responses from members of different age, sex, and ethnic
   groups.
   CONCLUSION: Although overall altruism and inconvenience were the major
   motivating factor and deterrent for blood, some demographic differences
   existed in donor attitude toward incentive programs and preference for
   the method of contact used by blood centers for recruitment purposes.}},

   revenues with fewer trade distorting effects on the land market. (JEL

Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{328-334}},

Abstract = {{Background. Delivery in a healthcare facility is associated with better
   outcomes for both mother and child. However, in India, a large
   proportion of deliveries take place outside health facilities. We
   studied the effect of maternal education on the choice of location for
   delivery in the Indian population.
   Methods. Data from the National Family Health Survey 3 (NFHS-3) were
   used. The survey included women who were selected using a multi-stage
   (2-stage for urban areas and 3-stage for rural areas), stratified (based
   on demographic or social factors) sampling technique; the primary
   sampling units selected were proportional to population size, and the
   subsequent steps used simple random sampling. Effect of maternal
   education on the choice of place for delivery (home, public or private
   facility) was investigated through a multinomial logistic regression
   model. The model adjusted for several factors at individual, household
   and community level, the survey design effect and included sampling
   weights.
   Results. Of the 124 385 women aged 15-49 years included in the NFHS-3
   dataset, 36 850 (29.6\%) had had one or more childbirth during the past
   5 years. A little more than half of all the deliveries were at home, and
   approximately a quarter each of the remaining deliveries were at public
   and private facilities, respectively. Maternal education was strongly
   and independently associated with the choice of location of delivery.
   For the choice sets of public facility versus home delivery and private
   facility versus home delivery, a clear dose-response relationship was
   apparent-higher maternal education was associated with a higher
   probability of delivery at a public or private health facility compared
   to home.
   Conclusion. Level of maternal education was a significant independent
   predictor of choice of location for childbirth among Indian women.
   Compared to cash incentives to increase facility-based delivery,
   improving maternal education may be a better way to achieve long term
   and sustained increase in facility deliveries in India.}},

Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1029-1036}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: There is growing international interest in the use of
   financial incentives in smoking cessation, yet little research on public
   opinion of the scheme. This paper reports on the acceptability of
   incentives for reducing smoking in pregnant women and the perceived size
   of incentive that would encourage smoking cessation during pregnancy.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted on a convenience sample
   of 213 women attending the antenatal clinic of a large public hospital
   in Australia. Participants completed a questionnaire on their views on
   the use of incentives with responses measured on a 5-point Likert scale.
   Results: The majority of participants (60\%) did not agree that paying
   pregnant smokers to quit is a good idea. Opinions regarding the likely
   effectiveness were mixed with 30\% of respondents in agreement and 22\%
   undecided. Most (62\%) were not willing to pay smokers any amount to
   quit. Smokers were more likely to have more favorable views about
   incentives than nonsmokers (p < .0001) and considered payments of
   between \$100 and >\$1,000 acceptable as reward for quitting smoking.
   Conclusions: Acceptability for the use of financial incentives in
   reducing antenatal smoking is low among pregnant women. Future research
   should explore views of a wider audience and continue to gather stronger
   evidence of the efficacy of rewards for reducing smoking in pregnancy.}},

Title = {{Ten-Year Survey of Program Directors: Trends, Challenges, and Mentoring
   in Prosthodontics. Part 1}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PROSTHODONTICS-IMPLANT ESTHETIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE DENTISTRY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{20}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: This study consisted of two parts. Part 1 was a survey of US
   program directors, and Part 2 reports on the survey findings distributed
   to the deans of US dental schools. Both surveys evaluated observations
   of trends in prosthodontic education. The first survey (2005) of program
   directors and deans was published in 2007. This second survey was
   conducted in 2009. The 2009 survey provided 10-year data on trends in
   prosthodontics as reported by program directors.
   Materials and Methods: A national e-mail survey of 46 program directors
   was used to collect enrollment data for years 1 to 3 of prosthodontics
   training for US and international dental school graduates, the total
   number of applicants and applications considered, and the trends over
   time of applicants to prosthodontics for US dental school graduates and
   for international graduates. In addition, the program directors were
   asked to rank 13 key factors that may have contributed to any changes in
   the prosthodontic applicant pool. Program directors were also asked for
   information on student financial incentives and whether their programs
   were state or federally funded, and whether their sponsoring institution
   was a dental school.
   Results: Of the 46 program directors, 40 responded, for an 87\% response
   rate. Respondents reported that 66\% of their enrollees were graduates
   of US dental schools. Between 2000 and 2009 the applicant pool in
   prosthodontics nearly doubled, with 50\% of the program directors
   reporting an increase in US-trained applicants, 42.5\% reporting no
   change, and only 7.5\% reporting a decrease. Using the Spearman
   correlation for the 10-year survey, there was a positive, statistically
   significant correlation that society's demand for a higher level of
   training and credentialing and interest in prosthodontics among dental
   students contributed to an increase in the number of US dental graduates
   applying to prosthodontic programs. Only four programs offered no
   financial packages to offset tuition. The remaining 36 respondents
   reported some financial package. Among the respondents, there were 23
   state-sponsored programs and 6 sponsored by private universities; the
   remaining 9 were sponsored by hospitals or federal agencies.
   Conclusions: A nearly doubled applicant pool and more US-trained
   applicants to prosthodontics ensure a much more competitive applicant
   pool for our specialty. In the 2009 survey, program directors reported
   that factors such as society's demand for a higher level of training and
   credentialing, interest in prosthodontics among US dental students,
   advances in implant, esthetic, and reconstructive dentistry, literature
   pertaining to the need of prosthodontists for the future, marketing of
   prosthodontics as a career, and the dollar value of prosthodontic
   training have all had some impact on increasing the mentored applicant
   pool to prosthodontic training in the United States.}},

Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{2513-2523}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a method for assessing conservation opportunity on
   private land based on landholders' socio-economic, behavioral, and farm
   characteristics. These characteristics include age, gender, education,
   level of off-farm income, farm size, proportion of remnant native
   vegetation on-farm, and ecological value of native vegetation on-farm. A
   sample of landholders who own greater than 2 ha of land in the South
   Australian Murray-Darling Basin region were sent a mail-based survey
   about their values and preferences for environmental management (N =
   659, 52\% response). Cross-tabulations and ANOVA statistical analysis
   techniques were used to compare the socio-economic attributes across
   three landholder classes: disengaged, moderately engaged, and highly
   engaged in native vegetation planting. Results indicate that highly
   engaged landholders were more likely to be female, formally educated,
   hobby farmers who managed small parcels of land and have high off-farm
   incomes, whereas disengaged landholders held significantly stronger
   farming connections (more farming experience, family have lived on the
   farm for more generations). Spatial analysis revealed area-specific
   differences in conservation opportunity and conservation priority. In
   some areas, properties of high ecological value were managed by highly
   engaged landholders, but nearby properties of high value were managed by
   moderately engaged or disengaged landholders. Environmental managers
   therefore cannot assume areas of high conservation priority will be
   areas of high conservation opportunity. At the regional scale, the
   potential for revegetation seems most promising within the moderately
   engaged landholder group considering the vast amount of land managed by
   this group in areas of high ecological value, particularly within the
   less represented Mallee and Coorong and Rangelands sub-regions. We
   suggest that incentive schemes which purchase conservation need to be
   targeted at disengaged landholders: mentoring schemes led by commercial
   farmers highly engaged in native vegetation planting should be directed
   at moderately engaged landholders, and; awards programs which
   acknowledge conservation successes should be targeted at highly engaged
   landholders. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Survey Nonresponders to a Medication-beliefs Survey Have Worse Adherence

Journal = {{MEDICAL CARE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{956-961}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The primary objective of this study was to investigate
   whether nonresponders to a medication-beliefs survey exhibited different
   adherence and persistence patterns than survey responders.
   Methods: A medication-beliefs survey was mailed to 7795 adults aged from
   40 to 88 years, who filled a qualifying index prescription
   (cardiovascular, dyslipidemia, oral-antihyperglycemic,
   oral-bisphosphonate, and asthma-controller medications) in June 2008 at
   1 national and 2 regional retail pharmacies. Adherence and persistence
   to the index drug class was measured using pharmacy-claims data over 12
   months. A multivariate generalized linear model with a negative binomial
   distribution and log-link function was used to determine whether
   response status was a significant predictor of adherence. Kaplan-Meier
   estimates of survival curves were used to assess the time to
   discontinuation (persistence). Differences between nonresponders and
   responders were assessed using the log-rank test.
   Results: The survey response rate was 24.25\%. The final analytic sample
   size after exclusions was 6740 patients (5044 nonresponders and 1696
   responders). On the basis of multivariate generalized linear model
   analysis, survey nonresponders had 11\% lower medication adherence
   compared with responders (P < 0.01; goodness-of-fit = 1.09 as defined by
   deviance/df statistics). The proportion of nonresponders deemed
   nonpersistent at day 305 was 66.3\% compared with 58.1\% of responders
   (P < 0.001). The Kaplan-Meier persistence curves were significantly
   different for nonresponders and responders as assessed by the log-rank
   test (chi(2) statistic - 49.38; P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Our study found that the responders and nonresponders to a
   medication-beliefs survey differed significantly in their subsequent
   adherence and persistence, suggesting that biased survey results are
   likely to accompany low response rates in surveys of medication use. The
   use of modest monetary incentives had a small effect on survey response;
   multiple survey levers are recommended to reduce nonresponse and the
   potential for biased results.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Some believe that a substantial amount of US health care is
   unnecessary, suggesting that it would be possible to control costs
   without rationing effective services. The views of primary care
   physicians-the frontline of health care delivery-are not known.
   Methods: Between June and December 2009, we conducted a nationally
   representative mail survey of US primary care physicians (general
   internal medicine and family practice) randomly selected from the
   American Medical Association Physician Masterfile (response rate, 70\%;
   n=627).
   Results: Forty-two percent of US primary care physicians believe that
   patients in their own practice are receiving too much care; only 6\%
   said they were receiving too little. The most important factors
   physicians identified as leading them to practice more aggressively were
   malpractice concerns (76\%), clinical performance measures (52\%), and
   inadequate time to spend with patients (40\%). Physicians also believe
   that financial incentives encourage aggressive practice: 62\% said
   diagnostic testing would be reduced if it did not generate revenue for
   medical subspecialists (39\% for primary care physicians). Almost all
   physicians (95\%) believe that physicians vary in what they would do for
   identical patients; 76\% are interested in learning how aggressive or
   conservative their own practice style is compared with that of other
   physicians in their community.
   Conclusions: Many US primary care physicians believe that their own
   patients are receiving too much medical care. Malpractice reform,
   realignment of financial incentives, and more time with patients could
   remove pressure on physicians to do more than they feel is needed.
   Physicians are interested in feedback on their practice style,
   suggesting they may be receptive to change.}},

Title = {{More mentoring needed? A cross-sectional study of mentoring programs for
   medical students in Germany}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{SEP 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: Despite increasing recognition that mentoring is essential
   early in medical careers, little is known about the prevalence of
   mentoring programs for medical students. We conducted this study to
   survey all medical schools in Germany regarding the prevalence of
   mentoring programs for medical students as well as the characteristics,
   goals and effectiveness of these programs.
   Methods: A definition of mentoring was established and program inclusion
   criteria were determined based on a review of the literature. The
   literature defined mentoring as a steady, long-lasting relationship
   designed to promote the mentee's overall development. We developed a
   questionnaire to assess key characteristics of mentoring programs: the
   advocated mentoring model, the number of participating mentees and
   mentors, funding and staff, and characteristics of mentees and mentors
   (e. g., level of training). In addition, the survey characterized the
   mentee-mentor relationship regarding the frequency of meetings, forms of
   communication, incentives for mentors, the mode of matching mentors and
   mentees, and results of program evaluations. Furthermore, participants
   were asked to characterize the aims of their programs. The questionnaire
   consisted of 34 questions total, in multiplechoice (17), numeric (7) and
   free-text (10) format. This questionnaire was sent to deans and medical
   education faculty in Germany between June and September 2009. For
   numeric answers, mean, median, and standard deviation were determined.
   For free-text items, responses were coded into categories using
   qualitative free text analysis.
   Results: We received responses from all 36 medical schools in Germany.
   We found that 20 out of 36 medical schools in Germany offer 22 active
   mentoring programs with a median of 125 and a total of 5,843 medical
   students (6.9-7.4\% of all German medical students) enrolled as mentees
   at the time of the survey. 14 out of 22 programs (63\%) have been
   established within the last 2 years. Six programs (27\%) offer mentoring
   in a one-on-one setting. 18 programs (82\%) feature faculty physicians
   as mentors. Nine programs (41\%) involve students as mentors in a
   peer-mentoring setting. The most commonly reported goals of the
   mentoring programs include: establishing the mentee's professional
   network (13 programs, 59\%), enhancement of academic performance (11
   programs, 50\%) and counseling students in difficulties (10 programs,
   45\%).
   Conclusions: Despite a clear upsurge of mentoring programs for German
   medical students over recent years, the overall availability of
   mentoring is still limited. The mentoring models and goals of the
   existing programs vary considerably. Outcome data from controlled
   studies are needed to compare the efficiency and effectiveness of
   different forms of mentoring for medical students.}},

Abstract = {{According to neoclassical economic theory, a stated preference
   elicitation format comprising a single binary choice between the status
   quo and one alternative is incentive compatible under certain
   conditions. Formats typically used in choice experiments comprising a
   sequence of discrete choice questions do not hold this property. In this
   paper, the effect on stated preferences of expanding the number of
   binary choice tasks per respondent from one to four is tested using a
   split sample treatment in an attribute-based survey relating to the
   undergrounding of overhead low-voltage electricity and
   telecommunications wires. We find evidence to suggest that presenting
   multiple choice tasks per respondent decreases estimates of expected
   willingness to pay. Preferences stated in the first of a sequence of
   choice tasks are not significantly different from those stated in the
   incentive compatible single binary choice task, but, in subsequent
   choice tasks, responses are influenced by cost levels observed in past
   questions. Three behavioural explanations can be advanced - weak
   strategic misrepresentation, reference point revision, and asymmetric
   value learning. The evidence is contrary to the standard assumption of
   truthful response with stable preferences. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We report results from two statewide experiments in Washington designed
   to test potential methods for using postal mail to obtain survey
   responses over the Internet from address-based samples of general public
   households. The five methods we test are: 1) sending Web and mail modes
   of response sequentially; 2) providing a prepaid \$5 incentive; 3)
   offering an instruction card for responding over the Web; 4) sending the
   follow-up request by Priority Mail; and 5) providing an additional \$5
   incentive with this follow-up request. Results are evaluated from the
   standpoint of response rates, demographic representativeness of
   respondents, and survey costs and data collection times for Web and mail
   modes. We find that a ``Web-plus-mail{''} design-mailing an initial Web
   request followed by a mail request-with the prepaid incentive offers
   much potential for obtaining Internet responses. In addition, the mail
   follow-up to the initial Web request significantly increases overall
   response rates and improves respondent representativeness. However, the

Abstract = {{Objective: Accurate medical error reporting is crucial for reducing the
   occurrence of such errors and their adverse consequences. This study
   aims to investigate the views of physicians about medical error
   reporting in a tertiary care hospital in Saudi Arabia.
   Methods: This is a cross-sectional self-administrated survey study. All
   physicians in the hospital were invited to complete an anonymous survey
   questionnaire addressing demographic details, as well as attitudes,
   practice, and views on medical error reporting.
   Results: One hundred seven physicians completed the questionnaires
   (66.5\% response rate). Mean (SD) age was 39.8 (9.0) years. One-fifth of
   the respondents worked in the emergency department, and half had a
   workload of 40 to 59 h/wk. The reason given by 41.1\% for not reporting
   a medical error by a colleague was that ``it is not their
   responsibility.{''} However, the gravity of the outcome of a medical
   error by a colleague to the patient was thought to be an important
   incentive for reporting. Of the physicians, 43\% agreed that they would
   conceal the occurrence of a medical error they incurred to ``avoid
   punishment.{''} Nevertheless, most of the respondents held the view that
   there exists an ethical underpinning for reporting medical errors and
   that reporting of medical errors serve a valuable purpose.
   Conclusions: The physicians in our study are likely to disclose errors
   made by a colleague only if the error resulted in a severe damage to the
   patient, and as such, medical errors go underreported for a variety of
   reasons. It was felt that assurance of confidentiality and protection
   from backlash would promote medical error disclosure.}},

Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{10-33}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are rapidly becoming the
   foundations to the decision support systems of many organizations, but
   have all too often failed to deliver their expected benefits. Most ERP
   implementation projects are carried out using implementation consultants
   hired from outside the client firm. The current study treated the
   consultants as agents and the clients as principals, and applied agency
   theory to test the consultant-client relationship as a predictor of ERP
   implementation project success.
   A survey collected responses from 192 client project managers who worked
   on the ERP implementation process in their organizations. Data analysis
   via structural equation modeling showed that more consultant monitoring
   predicts less moral hazard (i.e., consultant shirking), that less moral
   hazard predicts greater ERP project success, and that more monitoring
   directly predicts such success. However, the analysis failed to support
   expectations that more pre-qualification efforts (i.e., screening of the
   consultant) would lead to less adverse selection (i.e., the consultant's
   misrepresentation of skills) or that less adverse selection would lead
   to greater ERP success. Surprisingly greater incentive alignment
   predicted greater moral hazard, thus suggesting the potential of
   incentives to de-motivate rather than motivate.
   This study contributed by extending agency theory to outsourced
   information systems project implementation. It provided new, validated
   measures of prequalification efforts, monitoring, incentive alignment,
   moral hazard, and adverse selection constructs. The findings suggest
   that future researchers may want to learn more about incentive alignment
   and its impact, and that information systems project managers may want
   to monitor more to improve ERP and other large-scale system
   implementation success.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we use data from a unique survey conducted in the

   likely exogenous shock proxy, we find that child labor increases with
   the magnitude of the shock but only if households do not receive credit.
   This suggests that following shocks child labor may be a response to
   non-availability of credit. The policy implication suggests a distinct
   and alternative channel in combating the economic incentives behind
   child labor access to credit diminishes the immediate financial burden
   on constrained households, reducing their need for child labor. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Background: Early detection of symptoms arising from exposure to

   timely intervention. The administration of Web-based questionnaires is a
   potential method for collecting information from a sample population.
   Objective: The objective of our study was to develop a Web-based daily
   questionnaire for health (WDQH) for symptomatic surveillance.
   Methods: We adopted two different survey methods to develop the WDQH: an
   Internet panel survey, which included participants already registered
   with an Internet survey company, and the Tokyo Consumers' Co-operative
   Union (TCCU) Internet survey, in cooperation with the Japanese
   Consumers' Co-operative Union, which recruited participants by website
   advertising. The Internet panel survey participants were given a fee
   every day for providing answers, and the survey was repeated twice with
   modified surveys and collection methods: Internet Panel Survey I was
   conducted every day, and Internet Panel Survey II was conducted every 3
   days to reduce costs. We examined whether the survey remained valid by
   reporting health conditions on day 1 over a 3-day period, and whether
   the response rate would vary among groups with different incentives. In
   the TCCU survey, participants were given a fee only for initially
   registering, and health information was provided in return for survey
   completion. The WDQH included the demographic details of participants
   and prompted them to answer questions about the presence of various
   symptoms by email. Health information collected by the WDQH was then
   used for the syndromic surveillance of infection.
   Results: Response rates averaged 47.3\% for Internet Panel Survey I,
   42.7\% for Internet Panel Survey II, and 40.1\% for the TCCU survey.
   During a seasonal influenza epidemic, the WDQH detected a rapid increase
   in the number of participants with fever through the early aberration
   reporting system.
   Conclusions: We developed a health observation method based on
   self-reporting by participants via the Internet. We validated the
   usefulness of the WDQH by its practical use in syndromic surveillance.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Improvement of access to general practice is a priority in
   England. In 2006/07 an annual national survey of patient experience of
   access was introduced, with financial incentives to practices based on
   the findings of the survey among their own patients. Objectives: To
   describe changes in patient experience of access over the first two
   years of the survey and incentive scheme, and identify respondent and
   practice characteristics associated with patient experience of access.
   Design and methods: The study included 222 general practices in the east
   of England, which had completed the access survey in 2006/07 and
   2007/08. We compared proportions of patients reporting satisfaction with
   different aspects of access in each year. In explanatory regression
   models, we investigated the associations between improvement of reported
   access and respondent and practice characteristics. Results: There were
   some small improvements in reported access between the two surveys,
   although satisfaction with opening hours declined marginally. The
   explanatory analysis showed that larger practices, a higher proportion
   of respondents from ethnic minority groups, and higher deprivation were
   associated with patient reports of worse access. These variables and
   practice response rates did not explain the amount of change between the
   two years.
   Conclusions : The launch of the incentive scheme was not followed by
   convincing improvements in patient experience of access. Practices with
   deprived populations or with a high proportion of ethnic minority survey
   respondents are perceived as offering worse access, were not more likely
   to achieve improvements, and additional support should be considered to
   help these practices.}},

Abstract = {{The Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) is a nationally representative
   longitudinal survey of approximately 9,000 families and their
   descendants that has been ongoing since 1968. Since 1969, families have
   been sent a mailing asking them to update or verify their contact
   information to keep track of their whereabouts between waves. Having
   updated contact information prior to data collection is associated with
   fewer call attempts and refusal conversion efforts, less tracking, and
   lower attrition. Given these apparent advantages, a study was designed
   in advance of the 2009 PSID field effort to improve the response rate of
   the contact update mailing. Families were randomly assigned to the
   following conditions: mailing design (traditional versus new), \$10 as a
   prepaid versus postpaid incentive, timing and frequency of the mailing
   (July 2008 versus October 2008 versus both times) and whether or not
   they were sent a study newsletter. This article reports on findings with
   regard to response rates to the mailing and the effect on production
   outcomes including tracking rates and number of calls during 2009 under
   these different conditions, examines whether the treatment effects

Abstract = {{Objectives: Increased recognition that addictive behaviors tend to be
   chronic and relapsing has led to a growing emphasis on longitudinal
   substance abuse research. The purpose of this study was to identify
   effective follow-up strategies used by National Institute on Drug
   Abuse-funded investigators who have conducted at least 1 study involving
   follow-up data collection from human subjects.
   Methods: A web-based survey was administered to a representative sample
   of National Institute on Drug Abuse-funded researchers (N = 153) with a
   history of conducting longitudinal research.
   Results: Reported study response rates were generally high, although
   27\% of the studies fell below the 80\% benchmark. Face-to-face and
   telephone-based interviews commanded the largest subject payments-2 to 3
   times higher than compensation rates for collection of biologic samples.
   With regard to the presumed impact of low follow-up rates on the
   generalizability of study findings, one-third of investigators who
   compared baseline characteristics of those who did and did not
   participate in the follow-up found meaningful differences. Support was
   found for the hypothesis that follow-up rates and total compensation
   would be positively related, with the mean compensation amounts between
   studies achieving <80\% follow-up rate versus those achieving rates >=
   80\%, revealing a statistically significant effect in the predicted
   direction.
   Conclusions: The majority of respondents reported difficulty in tracking
   and locating subjects, and study respondents often proved to be quite
   different from nonrespondents. Incentives improved follow-up rates to a
   point, although the relationship was not linear. Efforts to improve
   follow-up rates may be better spent on addressing tracking and locating
   logistics rather than on strategies to compel participation once the

Journal = {{IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAY 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: Community-based organizations (CBOs) are important
   stakeholders in health systems and are increasingly called upon to use
   research evidence to inform their advocacy, program planning, and
   service delivery. To better support CBOs to find and use research
   evidence, we sought to assess the capacity of CBOs in the HIV/AIDS
   sector to acquire, assess, adapt, and apply research evidence in their
   work.
   Methods: We invited executive directors of HIV/AIDS CBOs in Ontario,
   Canada (n = 51) to complete the Canadian Health Services Research
   Foundation's ``Is Research Working for You?{''} survey.
   Findings: Based on responses from 25 organizations that collectively
   provide services to approximately 32,000 clients per year with 290
   full-time equivalent staff, we found organizational capacity to acquire,
   assess, adapt, and apply research evidence to be low. CBO strengths
   include supporting a culture that rewards flexibility and quality
   improvement, exchanging information within their organization, and
   ensuring that their decision-making processes have a place for research.
   However, CBO Executive Directors indicated that they lacked the skills,
   time, resources, incentives, and links with experts to acquire research,
   assess its quality and reliability, and summarize it in a user-friendly
   way.
   Conclusion: Given the limited capacity to find and use research
   evidence, we recommend a capacity-building strategy for HIV/AIDS CBOs
   that focuses on providing the tools, resources, and skills needed to
   more consistently acquire, assess, adapt, and apply research evidence.
   Such a strategy may be appropriate in other sectors and jurisdictions as
   well given that CBO Executive Directors in the HIV/AIDS sector in
   Ontario report low capacity despite being in the enviable position of
   having stable government infrastructure in place to support them,
   benefiting from long-standing investment in capacity building, and being
   part of an active provincial network. CBOs in other sectors and
   jurisdictions that have fewer supports may have comparable or lower
   capacity. Future research should examine a larger sample of CBO
   Executive Directors from a range of sectors and jurisdictions.}},

Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{MAY 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: Maximizing response rates is critically important in order
   to provide the most generalizable and unbiased research results. High
   response rates reduce the chance of respondents being systematically
   different from non-respondents, and thus, reduce the risk of results not
   truly reflecting the study population. Monetary incentives are often
   used to improve response rates, but little is known about whether larger
   incentives improve response rates in those who previously have been
   unenthusiastic about participating in research. In this study we
   compared the response rates and cost-effectiveness of a \$ 5 versus \$ 2
   monetary incentive accompanying a short survey mailed to patients who
   did not respond or refused to participate in research study with a
   face-to-face survey.
   Methods: 1,328 non-responders were randomly assigned to receive \$ 5 or
   \$ 2 and a short, 10-question survey by mail. Reminder postcards were
   sent to everyone; those not returning the survey were sent a second
   survey without incentive. Overall response rates, response rates by
   incentive condition, and odds of responding to the larger incentive were
   calculated. Total costs (materials, postage, and labor) and incremental
   cost-effectiveness ratios were also calculated and compared by incentive
   condition.
   Results: After the first mailing, the response rate within the \$ 5
   group was significantly higher (57.8\% vs. 47.7\%, p < .001); after the
   second mailing, the difference narrowed by 80\%, resulting in a
   non-significant difference in cumulative rates between the \$ 5 and \$ 2
   groups (67.3\% vs. 65.4\%, respectively, p = .47). Regardless of
   incentive or number of contacts, respondents were significantly more
   likely to be male, white, married, and 50-75 years old. Total costs were
   higher with the larger versus smaller incentive (\$ 13.77 versus \$ 9.95
   per completed survey).
   Conclusions: A \$ 5 incentive provides a significantly higher response
   rate than a \$ 2 incentive if only one survey mailing is used but not if
   two survey mailings are used.}},

Abstract = {{Since 2005, the Ohio Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS)
   has used a prepaid phone card incentive in an effort to increase survey
   response. Although Ohio PRAMS has generally achieved an overall response
   rate of 70\%, African American participation has been significantly
   lower, a persistent problem documented by other PRAMS states. We
   examined the effect of a gift card incentive compared to the standard
   phone card on African American response. Sampled women in the African
   American stratum of Ohio PRAMS were randomly assigned to either the
   experimental (n = 276) or control (n = 274) incentive (\$10 CVS gift
   card or 30-min prepaid phone card, respectively). Response rates were
   calculated for the total number of sampled African American women during
   the study period. Partial or full completion of the survey instrument by
   mail or phone was considered a response. Logistic regression was used to
   identify independent predictors of response. Variables examined included
   age, education, ethnicity, marital status, smoking status, birth weight,
   Women Infants and Children (WIC) enrollment, prenatal care, parity, and
   incentive assignment. The overall unweighted response rate was
   significantly higher in the experimental group (60.5 vs. 48.5\%, P =
   .002). Maternal and infant characteristics were similar between groups.
   Logistic regression modeling revealed that having more than 12 years of
   education (OR = 2.46, 1.56-3.89), gift card incentive (OR = 1.46,
   1.02-2.10), and enrollment in WIC (OR = 1.57, 1.05-2.35) were
   independent predictors of increased survey response. Use of a \$10 CVS
   gift card incentive in place of a prepaid phone card can positively
   impact African American response in PRAMS.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the key findings from a research project that
   assessed the impacts of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's
   Time of Day Pricing Initiative on the behavior of passenger car users.
   The survey data, comprised of 505 observations, show that 7.4\% of
   passenger trips changed behavior because of the time of day pricing
   initiative, and that demand is inelastic to tolls with elasticities in
   the range of -0.11 to -0.24. Passenger car users who changed behavior
   responded to time of day pricing by implementing multidimensional
   strategies (3.23 different behavioral changes per user on average),
   involving behavioral responses such as changes in facility usage,
   changes in time of travel, changes in the payment type, and changes in
   mode/occupancy. The most frequently cited behavioral response was to
   shift mode, either to transit or carpool, and maintain the original time
   of travel (done in 2.55\% of trips), instead of changing time of travel
   and maintaining the use of the passenger car (0.69\% of trips). This
   reluctance to change travel schedules is undoubtedly a reflection of the
   limited time of travel flexibility that, on average, was estimated to be
   20.4 and 12.3 min for early and late arrival for work-related trips.
   This, in turn, suggests the need for comprehensive policies, possibly
   involving incentives or regulations to foster employers' participation
   in staggered/flexible work hour programs. Such approaches, combined with
   time of day pricing, are likely to be more effective in balancing car
   traffic during the day. Other behavioral responses of significance were
   reduce the number of trips made during the weekday peak-hours (1.65\%),
   and switching to EZ-Pass to take advantage of the toll discounts
   (0.81\%).}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To observe the frequency of cigarette smoking in medical
   students of King Edward Medical University and to determine associated
   variables.
   Method: A cross-sectional survey was conducted and data was collected
   through a self administered questionnaire from students at King Edward

   smoking status in family, number of cigarettes smoked/day, influence for
   starting it and use of nicotine replacement therapy was obtained.
   Duration of study was from April 1 to May 30, 2009. Smoker was defined
   as a person who, at the time of survey smoked cigarettes either daily or
   occasionally.
   Results: Response rate was 65.4\%, of these 396 (60.55\%) were male and
   88(13.45\%) were smokers. Smoking was more among the male students than
   females (p-value < 0.001). The greatest percentage of smokers was in 3rd
   Year (n=29, 26.85\%), majority were of 21-30 years age (n=59, 19.53\%),
   started smoking between 11-20 years (n=48, 54.54\%), smoked < 10

Title = {{Initial evaluation of rural programs at the Australian National
   University: understanding the effects of rural programs on intentions
   for rural and remote medical practice}},
Journal = {{RURAL AND REMOTE HEALTH}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR-JUN}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Rural health workforce issues are a priority area for the
   Australian Government and substantial funding has been provided for
   rural education programs to address health workforce disparities across
   Australia's rural and remote communities. The Australian Government
   established a Rural Health Strategy in 2001 and as a result there are
   now 14 rural clinical schools in Australia. The 2008 Urbis Report
   highlighted the lack of research on rural programs and workforce
   outcomes, essential to ensuring that educational efforts, resources and
   funding are being concentrated appropriately. This study examined the
   Australian National University (ANU) Medical School's 4 year rural
   program to identify the impact of elective and compulsory program
   components on student intentions to practice in a rural and remote
   location post-graduation. The study also explores factors that affect
   student decisions to apply for year-long rural placements.
   Methods: ANU Medical School's graduating cohort of 2008 fourth year
   medical students completed an anonymous and voluntary online survey
   questionnaire. Survey sections included student demographics, compulsory
   and elective components of the ANU rural program, and an overall
   evaluation of the ANU rural curriculum. The survey contained a mixture
   of forced-answer questions and open-ended commentary. Quantitative data
   were analyzed for descriptive and frequency statistics using EpiInfo
   V3.5.1 (http://wwwn.cdc.gov/epiinfo/). Qualitative data were reviewed
   and consistent themes among responses extracted.
   Results: In total, 40 students from a cohort of 88 (45\%) responded,
   with 26 respondents (65\%) indicating that at medical school
   commencement they considered working in a rural or remote area. At the
   end of their medical education, 33 respondents (82\%) indicated their
   intention to spend some time in their careers working in a rural or
   remote area. Students from non-rural backgrounds had greater positive
   change in their intentions to practice rurally as a direct effect of ANU
   rural programs when compared with students from rural backgrounds. More
   than 70\% of students believed the amount of rural focus in the
   curriculum was correct, 75\% believed that they will be better medical
   practitioners because of the program, and 85\% found the curriculum was
   delivered effectively. Students who undertook elective rural programs
   such as a year-long rural placement were more likely to have future
   rural career intentions when compared with students undertaking
   compulsory rural components. Compulsory components, however, had a
   strong influence on students applying for elective programs. Regarding
   application for the year-long rural placement, students reported
   clinical exposure was the most encouraging factor, and time away from
   family and friends, and lack of spousal and family support were the most
   discouraging factors.
   Conclusions: Rural programs at the ANU, and medical school exposure to
   rural health experiences is important in influencing students'
   perceptions of a career in rural and remote health. This study provides
   evidence that both compulsory and elective components contribute to a
   successful holistic rural program which nurtures the rural interest of
   all students. Overall, students at the ANU medical school were satisfied
   with the rural curriculum. The results confirm that there is difficulty
   in recruiting students with family commitments into year-long rural
   placement programs, despite incentives. Those students who select
   long-term rural study for reasons other than an interest in a career in
   rural health end the program with positive rural intentions.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To compare the response rates achieved for an online survey
   with a postal survey of general practitioners (GPs) as a method to
   evaluate the National STI Prevention Program.
   Methods: All GPs in Australia were asked to complete an online survey. A
   further sample of 509 GPs were asked to complete a postal survey.
   Response rates to both recruitment methods were compared. The
   demographic characteristics of responders were compared to the entire GP
   population of Australia.
   Results: Twenty GPs completed the online survey (response rate < 0.1\%).
   Sixty-three GPs completed the postal survey (response rate 12.4\%). The
   demographic characteristics of those responding to the postal survey
   showed no statistically significant difference compared to the general
   GP population.
   Conclusion: Our postal survey had a higher response rate than the online
   survey. Our response to the postal survey was lower than other similar
   studies and is likely to be due to a lack of incentives and follow-up.
   Even with the low response rate it appears that postal surveys can
   provide a good representation of the overall population.
   Implications: Despite growing use of online surveys, postal surveys
   should still be the method of choice whenever possible. Postal surveys
   should include incentives and further follow-up of the initial
   recruitment should be conducted.}},

Abstract = {{Objective
   To assess how quality information from multiple sources and financial
   incentives affect consumer choice of physicians in tiered physician
   networks.
   Data Source
   Survey of a stratified random sample of Massachusetts state employees.
   Study Design
   Respondents were assigned a hypothetical structure with differential
   copayments for ``Tier 1{''} (preferred) and ``Tier 2{''} (nonpreferred)
   physicians. Half of respondents were told they needed to select a
   cardiologist, and half were told they needed to select a dermatologist.
   Patients were asked whether they would choose a Tier 1 doctor, a Tier 2
   doctor, or had no preference in a case where they had no further quality
   information, a case where a family member or friend recommended a Tier 2
   doctor, and a case where their personal physician recommended a Tier 2
   doctor. The effects of copayments, recommendations, physician specialty,
   and patient characteristics on the reported probability of selecting a
   Tier 1 doctor are analyzed using multinomial logit and logistic
   regression.
   Principal Findings
   Relative to a case where there is no copayment differential between
   tiers, copayment differences of U.S.\$10-U.S.\$35 increase the number of
   respondents indicating they would select a Tier 1 physician by 3.5-11.7
   percent. Simulations suggest copayments must exceed U.S.\$300 to
   counteract the recommendation for a lower tiered physician from friends,
   family, or a referring physician. Sensitivity to the copayments varied
   with physician specialty.
   Conclusions
   Tiered provider networks with these copayment levels appear to have
   limited influence on physician choice when contradicted by other trusted
   sources. Consumers' response likely varies with physician specialty.}},

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1219-1227}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The positive association between social capital and general health
   outcomes has been extensively researched over the past decade; however,
   studies investigating social capital and psychological health show less
   consistent results. Despite this, policy-makers worldwide still employ
   elements of social capital to promote and improve psychological health.
   This United Kingdom study investigates the association between changes
   in psychological health over time and three different individual-level
   proxies of social capital, measures of socio-economic status, social
   support and the confounders age and gender. All data are derived from
   the British Household Panel Survey data, with the same individuals (N =
   7994) providing responses from 2000-2007.
   The data were split according to baseline psychological health status
   ('Good' or `Poor' psychological health the dependent variable). Using
   Generalised Estimating Equations, two separate models were built to
   investigate the association between changes from baseline psychological
   health over time and considered variables. An autoregressive working
   correlation structure was employed to derive the true influence of
   explanatory variables on psychological health outcomes over time.
   We found that generalised trust was the only social capital variable to
   maintain a positive and highly significant association with
   psychological health in multivariable models. All measures of
   socioeconomic status and social support were rendered insignificant, bar
   one. We therefore argue that the breakdown of the traditional family
   unit (and subsequent reduction in family capital investment), along with
   psychosocial pathways, demonstrate plausible mechanisms by which a
   decrease in generalised trust could lead to an increasing trend of worse
   psychological health in youth over successive birth cohorts. Policy
   makers, while providing welfare solutions in response to breakdown in
   traditional family structure, must also consider perverse incentives
   they provide. If perceived as a viable lifestyle choice, welfare
   provision could inadvertently promote further decline of trust, at even
   greater cost to society. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{21-32}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The estimation of non-market environmental values remains a challenge to
   economists seeking to provide relevant information to policy-makers. The
   demand for such information is increasing, especially in response to
   statutory requirements for economic analyses of policy initiatives.
   Studies undertaken in response to this demand continue to be criticised
   for producing biased results. Research into the use of Choice Modelling
   to estimate environmental values has sought to meet that challenge.
   Choice Modelling involves survey respondents revealing their values for
   environmental changes by making choices between numerous alternative
   future management scenarios. Through the choices made, inferences can be
   drawn about the trade-offs people are willing to make across
   environmental outcomes. By specifying one of those outcomes as a
   monetary cost, respondents' willingness to pay for different policies
   can be estimated. Recent research projects outlined here have estimated
   the value of catchment protection investments in New South Wales and
   Tasmania, alternative management of nature reserves, and climate change
   impacts. Key methodology issues confronted in these applications have
   been the design of choice experiment surveys to ensure that respondents
   have an incentive to answer without bias, the incorporation of
   uncertainty in the future management scenarios, the selection of
   appropriate attributes of environmental change, the integration of value
   information into decision support systems, and the determination of the
   impact of alternative scales and scopes of analysis.}},

Abstract = {{We construct a quantitative general equilibrium lifecycle model with
   housing tenure decisions to investigate the degree to which wealth
   inequality in the United States is affected by the preferential tax
   treatment of home-ownership. Favorable tax treatment of owner occupied
   housing in the form of home mortgage interest and property tax
   deductibility, and the untaxed nature of imputed rents, provides a
   financial incentive for home-ownership over renting as well as an
   incentive to ``over-consume{''} housing since houses are not fungible.
   Since the favorable tax treatment of housing disproportionately creates
   tax savings for the upper quantiles of the income distribution, we
   quantify how it contributes to the heavily right skewed distribution of
   wealth in the United States using data from the Survey of Consumer
   Finances. We consider a revenue-neutral government response to the
   counter factual experiments of removing the current tax structure on
   housing. Our quantitative analysis shows that, in terms of
   distributional effects, removing all of the preferential tax treatments
   results in an aggregate increase in welfare. However, we do not find any
   reduction in inequality. We also find that while some re-allocation
   toward financial assets occurs, households primarily increase their
   consumption when imputed housing rents are taxed and the property tax
   deduction is removed. Thus housing tax policy may be effective at
   encouraging more overall saving through housing assets. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to explore the perceptions of community
   pharmacists towards the concept of pharmaceutical care, implementing
   frequencies of pharmaceutical care, and barriers to implementation of
   pharmaceutical care in China. A 38-item self-completion pre-tested
   questionnaire was administered to a quota sample of 130 pharmacists in
   community pharmacies in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, northwest China in
   April 2008. Main outcome measures included understanding of
   pharmaceutical care; perceived frequency of pharmaceutical care
   activities; attitude towards pharmaceutical care; barriers to
   implementation of pharmaceutical care. A response rate of 77.7\%
   (101/130) was achieved. The data were analysed descriptively. Factor
   analysis was used to explore potential barriers to the provision of
   pharmaceutical care. Respondents' understanding of the definition of
   pharmaceutical care was not entirely satisfactory: it was widely but
   incorrectly seen as a medication counselling service and many
   pharmacists appeared to misunderstand their role in the process.
   Respondents spent most of their work time performing prescription checks
   and providing patients with directions for drug administration, dosage,
   and precautions, but they tended to ignore health promotion within and
   outside of pharmacy settings. Factor analysis suggested four factors
   influencing the implementation of pharmaceutical care in the surveyed
   community pharmacies: lack of external conditions for developing or
   providing pharmaceutical care, lack of time and skills, absence of
   information and economic incentive, and lack of full support from other
   health professionals, with a cumulative variance of 64.7\%. Cronbach's
   alpha for the four factors was 0.71, 0.72, 0.69 and 0.74, respectively.
   Although the respondent pharmacists had a certain degree of
   understanding of the definition, aim, function and use of pharmaceutical
   care, and carried out some activities currently, a range of barriers
   need to be overcome before comprehensive pharmaceutical care becomes a
   reality in China. These barriers could be overcome through participation
   in effective continuing educational programmes, availability of more
   resources, effective collaboration with other health professionals.}},

   diabetes scored poorly with regard to intellectual and emotional
   satisfaction but received high ranking with regard to lifestyle. With
   regard to other factors, endocrinology was rated negatively on
   ``compensation,{''} ``number of procedures,{''} and ``patient adherence
   to prescribed treatment.{''} Exposure to diabetes during training had no
   major influence on the decision to enter endocrinology.
   Conclusion: Endocrinology with a focus on diabetes care is not an
   attractive specialty for most internal medicine and pediatric residents.
   Therefore, new strategies to attract residents to the field of diabetes
   care are needed.}},

Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},

Volume = {{86}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   To investigate whether financial incentives could reverse the trend of
   declining interest in primary care specialties among U.S. medical
   students.
   Method
   An electronic survey was sent to all U.S. fourth-year MD and DO medical
   students in 2009 with a Department of Defense service obligation.
   Students not selecting a primary care residency were asked if a
   hypothetical bonus paid before and after residency or an increase in
   annual salary of attendings in primary care specialties would have
   resulted in these students selecting primary care. Logistic regression
   was used to determine student characteristics associated with accepting
   a financial incentive.
   Results
   The survey response rate was 56\% (447/797). Sixty-six percent of
   students did not apply for a primary care residency. Of these, 30\%
   would have applied for primary care if they had been given a median
   bonus of \$27,500 (interquartile range {[}IQR] \$15,000-\$50,000) before
   and after residency. Forty-one percent of students would have considered
   applying for primary care for a median military annual salary after
   residency of \$175,000 (IQR \$150,000-\$200,000). Students who
   considered primary care but chose a controllable lifestyle specialty
   (e.g., radiology) were nearly four times more likely to name an
   influential hypothetical salary than were students who did not consider
   primary care and chose a noncontrollable lifestyle specialty (e.g.,
   surgery) (67\% versus 17\%, P < .0001).
   Conclusions
   U.S. medical students, particularly those considering primary care but
   selecting controllable lifestyle specialties, are more likely to
   consider applying for a primary care specialty if provided a financial
   incentive.}},

Abstract = {{Objective
   To determine whether hospitals increase efforts on easy tasks relative

   Data Source
   The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Hospital Compare data
   from Fiscal Years 2003 through 2005 and 2003 American Hospital
   Association Annual Survey data.
   Study Design
   We classified measures of process compliance targeted by the Premier
   Hospital Quality Incentive Demonstration as easy or difficult to improve
   based on whether they introduce additional per-patient costs. We
   compared process compliance on easy and difficult tasks at hospitals
   eligible for P4P bonus payments relative to hospitals engaged in public

   Principal Findings
   P4P hospitals did not preferentially increase efforts for easy tasks in
   patients with heart failure or pneumonia, but they did exhibit modestly
   greater effort on easy tasks for heart attack admissions. There is no
   systematic evidence that effort was allocated toward easier processes of
   care and away from more difficult tasks.
   Conclusions
   Despite perverse P4P incentives to change allocation of efforts across
   tasks to maximize performance scores at lowest cost, we find little
   evidence that hospitals respond to P4P incentives as hypothesized.

   participants' perspectives on postal survey design: a qualitative study}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{JAN 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Randomised controlled trials have investigated aspects of
   postal survey design yet cannot elaborate on reasons behind
   participants' decision making and survey behaviour. This paper reports
   participants' perspectives of the design of, and participation in, a
   longitudinal postal cohort survey. It describes strengths and weaknesses
   in study design from the perspectives of study participants and aims to
   contribute to the: 1) design of future cohort surveys and questionnaires
   generally and, 2) design of cohort surveys for people with
   musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) specifically.
   Methods: In-depth interviews explored the design of postal surveys
   previously completed by participants. Interviews used open ended
   questioning with a topic guide for prompts if areas of interest were not
   covered spontaneously. Thematic data analysis was undertaken based on
   the framework method. A second researcher verified all coding.
   Results: Data from fourteen interviews were analysed within three main
   themes; participation, survey design and survey content. One of the main
   findings was the importance of clear communication aimed at the correct
   audience both when inviting potential participants to take part and
   within the survey itself. Providing enough information about the study,
   having a topic of interest and an explanation of likely benefits of the
   study were important when inviting people to participate. The neutrality
   of the survey and origination from a reputable source were both
   important; as was an explanation about why information was being
   collected within the survey itself. Study findings included
   participants' impressions when invited to take part, why they
   participated, the acceptability of follow-up of non-responders and why
   participants completed the follow-up postal survey. Also discussed were
   participants' first impression of the survey, its length, presentation
   and participants' views about specific questions within the survey.
   Conclusions: Ideas generated in this study provide an insight into
   participants' decision making and survey behaviour and may enhance the
   acceptability of future surveys to potential participants. As well as
   clear communication, participants valued incentives and survey questions
   that were relevant to them. However, opinions varied as to the preferred
   format for responses with some advising more opportunity for open-ended
   feedback. We also found that some standard format questions can raise
   quandaries for individual participants.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of
   decentralised control on finished goods inventory levels in a

   overall inventory level.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors' study is based on a mixed
   method approach using both a survey and semi-structured interviews to
   assess inventory management practices and firm performance.
   Findings - It was found that the common assumptions that distribution
   outlets or dealers are homogenous and that their behaviour is uniform in
   response to central control, such as the manufacturer's strategy, do not
   hold in practice. In fact, the authors show that under conditions of
   decentralised control, the inventories held at outlet level vary greatly
   around the aggregate inventory at overall manufacturer level and in this
   sense bear little resemblance to it. Amongst other conclusions, these
   findings provide a possible explanation for previous studies'
   inconclusive evidence on inventory reduction.
   Research limitations/implications - The authors' research is based on
   evidence from the automotive industry in the USA; future research may
   include a wider industry analysis and geographical scope.
   Practical implications - The paper identifies how incentives and
   decision-making structures at the outlet level need to be considered in
   order to derive decisions that are optimal at the supply chain level.
   Originality/value - The paper extends the current literature on the
   determinants of inventory levels by using dealer-level data, as opposed
   to manufacturer or firm-level data in previous studies, thereby
   identifying possible causes for the previously inconclusive evidence on
   inventory levels in distribution systems.}},

Volume = {{87}},

Pages = {{39-58}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This article surveys current security challenges and identifies
   obstacles to effective global and regional responses and cooperation in
   an era when security has become increasingly divisible. The new
   situation is partly explained by the complexity and variety of security
   challenges, both traditional and new, and by the linkages between them.
   It argues that a new pattern of improvised, ad hoc and often
   case-specific security mechanisms has developed, which it calls
   Collective Conflict Management (CCM). The argument is illustrated by
   reference to cases of CCM where a wide range of actors-multilateral
   institutions at the global and regional levels, individual states or ad
   hoc coalitions, professional and commercial bodies, and non-governmental
   organizations-collaborate in an effort to manage specific security
   threats and challenges, bringing together a variety of relationships,
   resources and skills. The urge for collective action, rather than
   unilateral or single actor-led, is motivated by a number of factors and
   `drivers{''}, not all of them necessarily positive or constructive. The
   article concludes that the success or failure of CCM will depend in part
   on the severity of the problems it faces and in part on the motives and
   incentives behind collective responses. This new pattern raises
   interesting and important questions for the future of international
   security. While CCM may be untidy and lack clear norms and standards, in
   many cases it may be the best available in an increasingly fractured
   world.}},

Abstract = {{Medicare's prospective payment system for hospitals (PPS), introduced in

   at home. We analyse a national longitudinal survey, the first National

   Study, which includes data on more outcomes over a longer period than
   earlier studies. We find that the rate of admission to nursing homes
   from the community in the first weeks after a hospital discharge more
   than tripled under PPS, suggesting that families were not always able to
   cope. As another response to sicker patients, discharges directly to
   nursing homes from hospitals, which jumped initially under PPS, may have
   risen further when payment rates were tightened in the early 1990s.
   Hospital readmissions fell after the first few years. Our findings are

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{50-59}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Aims and objectives.
   This study examines the impact of implementing a new pay system (Agenda
   for Change) on nursing staff in the National Health Service (NHS) in the
   UK. This new pay system covered approximately 400,000 nursing staff. Its
   objectives were to improve the delivery of patient care as well as staff
   recruitment, retention and motivation.
   Background.
   The new system aimed to provide a simplified approach to pay
   determination, with a more systematic use of agreed job descriptions and
   job evaluation to `price' individual jobs, linked to a new career
   development framework.
   Design.
   Secondary analysis of survey data.
   Methods.
   Analysis of results of large-scale surveys of members of the Royal
   College of Nursing of the United Kingdom (RCN) to assess the response of
   nurses to questions about the implementation process itself and their
   attitude to pay levels.
   Results.
   The results demonstrated that there was some positive change after
   implementation of Agenda for Change in 2006, mainly some time after
   implementation, and that the process of implementation itself raised
   expectations that were not fully met for all nurses.
   Conclusions.
   There were clear indications of differential impact and reported
   experiences, with some categories of nurse being less satisfied with the
   process of implementation. The overall message is that a national pay
   system has strengths and weaknesses compared to the local systems used
   in other countries and that these benefits can only be maximised by
   effective communication, adequate funding and consistent management of
   the system.
   Relevance to clinical practice.
   How nurses' pay is determined and delivered can be a major satisfier and
   incentive to nurses if the process is well managed and can be a factor
   in supporting clinical practice, performance and innovation. This study
   highlights that a large-scale national exercise to reform the pay system
   for nurses is a major undertaking, carries risk and will take
   significant time to implement effectively.}},

   investigated whether they can reduce attrition from follow-up in online
   trials, which are particularly vulnerable to low follow-up rates.
   Objectives: Our objective was to determine the impact of incentives on
   follow-up rates in an online trial.
   Methods: Two randomized controlled trials were embedded in a large
   online trial of a Web-based intervention to reduce alcohol consumption
   (the Down Your Drink randomized controlled trial, DYD-RCT). Participants
   were those in the DYD pilot trial eligible for 3-month follow-up (study
   1) and those eligible for 12-month follow-up in the DYD main trial
   (study 2). Participants in both studies were randomly allocated to
   receive an offer of an incentive or to receive no offer of an incentive.
   In study 1, participants in the incentive arm were randomly offered a 5
   pound Amazon. co.uk gift voucher, a 5 pound charity donation to Cancer
   Research UK, or entry in a prize draw for 250 pound. In study 2,
   participants in the incentive arm were offered a 10 pound Amazon. co.uk
   gift voucher. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who
   completed follow-up questionnaires in the incentive arm(s) compared with
   the no incentive arm.
   Results: In study 1 (n = 1226), there was no significant difference in
   response rates between those participants offered an incentive (175/615,
   29\%) and those with no offer (162/611, 27\%) (difference = 2\%, 95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI] -3\% to 7\%). There was no significant
   difference in response rates among the three different incentives
   offered. In study 2 (n = 2591), response rates were 9\% higher in the
   group offered an incentive (476/1296, 37\%) than in the group not
   offered an incentive (364/1295, 28\%) (difference = 9\%, 95\% CI 5\% to
   12\%, P < .001). The incremental cost per extra successful follow-up in
   the incentive arm was 110 pound in study 1 and 52 pound in study 2.
   Conclusion: Whereas an offer of a 10 pound Amazon. co.uk gift voucher
   can increase follow-up rates in online trials, an offer of a lower
   incentive may not. The marginal costs involved require careful
   consideration.

Title = {{Systems-Level Smoking Cessation Activities by Private Health Plans}},
Journal = {{PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Introduction
   The US Public Health Service urges providers to screen patients for
   smoking and advise smokers to quit. Yet, these practices are not widely
   implemented in clinical practice. This study provides national estimates
   of systems-level strategies used by private health insurance plans to
   influence provider delivery of smoking cessation activities.
   Methods
   Data are from a nationally representative survey of health plans for
   benefit year 2003, across product types offered by insurers, including
   health maintenance organizations (HMOs), preferred provider
   organizations, and point-of-service products, regarding alcohol,
   tobacco, drug, and mental health services. Executive directors of 368
   health plans responded to the administrative module (83\% response
   rate). Medical directors of 347 of those health plans, representing 771
   products, completed the clinical module in which health plan respondents
   were asked about screening for smoking, guideline distribution, and
   incentives for guideline adherence.
   Results
   Only 9\% of products require, and 12\% verify, that primary care
   providers (PCPs) screen for smoking. HMOs are more likely than other
   product types to require screening. Only 17\% of products distribute
   smoking cessation guidelines to PCPs, and HMOs are more likely to do
   this. Feedback to PCPs was most frequently used to encourage guideline
   adherence; financial incentives were rarely used. Furthermore, health
   plans that did require screening often conducted other cessation
   activities.
   Conclusion
   Few private health plans have adopted techniques to encourage the use of
   smoking cessation activities by their providers. Increasing health plan
   involvement is necessary to reduce tobacco use and concomitant disease
   in the United States.}},

Pages = {{77-85}},
Abstract = {{This paper discusses the responses of participants in an off-hour
   delivery (OHD) pilot test to a postparticipation opinion survey. The
   pilot test was part of a project that investigated the use of financial
   incentives to receivers as a method to encourage OHD. The participants
   in the pilot test included eight carriers and 25 receivers; 12 used
   staffed OHD while the other 13 used unassisted OHD. In addition to the
   survey responses, information obtained from in-depth interviews with six
   of the participants provides insight into the operational benefits and
   potential difficulties of implementing OHD. Analysis of the responses
   indicates that carriers, receivers, and delivery drivers have a
   generally very favorable impression of their participation in OHD and
   shows that providing a financial incentive to receivers to encourage OHD
   is beneficial. Carriers saw reductions in costs, drivers experienced
   improved delivery conditions, and receivers saw substantial operational
   improvements such as being able to make better use of their staff as a
   result of the increased reliability of OHD. The potential of unassisted
   OHD is evidenced by the fact that most participants who used unassisted
   OHD during the pilot test continue to perform OHD without the financial
   incentive that was provided during the pilot test.}},

Title = {{Pay Enough, Don't Pay Too Much or Don't Pay at All? The Impact of Bonus
   Intensity on Job Satisfaction}},
Journal = {{KYKLOS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{597-626}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{This paper attempts to examine the effect of the intensity of financial
   incentives (i.e. the proportion of workers' salary that is tied to
   bonuses) on job satisfaction. Understanding the influence of monetary
   incentives on job satisfaction is important given that the composition
   of an employee's remuneration package is an integral element of his/her
   overall working conditions. According to the standard microeconomic
   paradigm, in long-run equilibrium one would not expect to observe any
   differences in the marginal utilities of comparable workers under fixed
   or variable payment schemes. This should hold since the expected value
   of the higher wages paid under performance-related pay (PRP) should be
   just sufficient to compensate for the additional earnings risk and the
   disutility of extra effort. However, once the standard assumptions of
   the agency model are relaxed, and psychological arguments such as those
   of motivation crowding out theory (Frey and Jegen, 2001) are taken into
   account, it is expected that PRP is likely to have a non-negligible
   impact on job satisfaction. To the extent that incentive schemes allow
   for optimization of effort, facilitate worker autonomy and enhance
   self-determination they should increase job satisfaction, other things
   equal. Yet increasing earnings risk, crowding out of the inherent
   pleasantness in performing one's job and lower morale can lead to
   disgruntled employees.
   Based on the above reasoning, a number of previous studies have focussed
   on the impact of the incidence of PRP on job satisfaction (Drago et al.,
   1992; McCausland et al., 2005; Heywood and Wei, 2006; Green and Heywood,
   2008; Artz, 2008; Pouliakas and Theodossiou, 2009). This masks the
   possibility that the utility of workers may vary according to the
   magnitude and intensity of incentives, as suggested by the experiments
   of Gneezy and Rustichini (2000{[}a]{[}b]) and Pokorny (2008). An
   important common element of the above experiments is that ``small{''}
   incentives are likely to exert a negative effect on behaviour (with
   discontinuity close to zero), while for high powered rewards (or
   punishments) the standard price effect is expected to prevail.
   This paper attempts to test these contrasting hypotheses by looking
   beyond the mere incidence of incentive pay and examining the impact of
   the intensity of incentives on job satisfaction instead. Specifically,
   10 waves (1998-2007) of the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) are
   used to investigate the ceteris paribus association between the
   intensity of bonus/profit-sharing payments, the dynamic change in bonus
   status and the utility derived from work. After controlling for
   individual heterogeneity biases, it is shown that job utility rises only
   in response to `generous' bonus payments, primarily in skilled,
   non-unionized, private sector jobs. Evidence is also presented that
   revoking a bonus from one year to the next is likely to have a
   detrimental impact on employee utility, and that over time job
   satisfaction tends to diminish as employees potentially adapt to the
   payment of bonuses (Georgellis and Tabvuma, 2010). The findings of the
   paper are therefore consistent with previous experimental evidence,
   suggesting that employers wishing to motivate their staff should indeed
   ``pay enough or don't pay at all{''}.}},

   Lobster Stocks in the Juan Fernandez Archipelago, Chile}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{Over-exploited fisheries are a common feature of the modern world and a
   range of solutions including area closures (marine reserves; MRs),
   effort reduction, gear changes, ecosystem-based management, incentives
   and co-management have been suggested as techniques to rebuild
   over-fished populations. Historic accounts of lobster (Jasus frontalis)
   on the Chilean Juan Fernandez Archipelago indicate a high abundance at
   all depths (intertidal to approximately 165 m), but presently lobsters
   are found almost exclusively in deeper regions of their natural
   distribution. Fishers' ecological knowledge (FEK) tells a story of
   serial depletion in lobster abundance at fishing grounds located closest
   to the fishing port with an associated decline in catch per unit effort
   (CPUE) throughout recent history. We have re-constructed baselines of
   lobster biomass throughout human history on the archipelago using
   historic data, the fishery catch record and FEK to permit examination of
   the potential effects of MRs, effort reduction and co-management
   (stewardship of catch) to restore stocks. We employed a bioeconomic
   model using FEK, fishery catch and effort data, underwater survey
   information, predicted population growth and response to MR protection
   (no-take) to explore different management strategies and their
   trade-offs to restore stocks and improve catches. Our findings indicate
   that increased stewardship of catch coupled with 30\% area closure (MR)
   provides the best option to reconstruct historic baselines. Based on
   model predictions, continued exploitation under the current management
   scheme is highly influenced by annual fluctuations and unsustainable. We
   propose a community-based co-management program to implement a MR in
   order to rebuild the lobster population while also providing
   conservation protection for marine species endemic to the Archipelago.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The control of blood-borne infections including HIV and
   hepatitis C (HCV) amongst injecting drug users (IDUs) is a challenge for
   health authorities in Iran. Hence, more reliable estimates of the levels
   of blood-borne infections and their associated factors are critically
   needed.
   Methods: Active IDUs were recruited using peer-driven sampling in a
   bio-behavioural survey in 2008. Over 8 weeks, data were collected from
   adults living in a city in Isfahan Province who had injected drugs in
   the past month. Participants provided a whole blood sample and answered
   questions on sexual and drug-related risk characteristics. Participants
   were provided post-test counselling and a non-monetary incentive for
   their participation. Excluding two inactive cases, the initial recruits
   resulted in 2-8 waves of recruitment.
   Results: Overall, 118 IDUs including three females participated. The
   estimated population proportions of HIV, hepatitis B. and HCV infections
   were 0.7\% (95\% Cl, 0.6-2.3), 0.7\% (95\% Cl, 0.1-2.1), and 59.4\%
   (95\% CI, 47.4-68.7), respectively. Responses indicated that 31\%(95\%
   Cl, 20-44.5) of the IDUs ever shared a needle/syringe for drug
   injection, and 77\% (95\% CI, 65-84) had ever injected an addictive
   solution marketed widely as Temgesic. Multivariate analyses revealed
   that the high prevalence of HCV infection amongst IDUs is associated
   with the lifetime duration of drug injection (AOR, 1.17; 95\% CI,
   1.01-1.34) and with having injected Temgesic (AOR, 4.73; 95\% Cl.
   1.52-14.69).
   Conclusion: Our experience in Iran indicates that IDUs can be recruited
   effectively in a bio-behavioural survey through peer-driven sampling and

Abstract = {{Background: Several strategies have been proposed to reform physician
   reimbursement while improving quality of care. Despite much debate,
   physicians' opinions regarding reimbursement reform proposals have not
   been objectively assessed.
   Methods: We conducted a national survey of randomly selected physicians
   between June 25 and October 31, 2009. Physicians rated their support for
   several reimbursement reform proposals: rewarding quality with financial
   incentives, bundling payments for episodes of care, shifting payments
   from procedures to management and counseling services, increasing pay to
   generalists, and offsetting increased pay to generalists with a
   reduction in pay for other specialties. Support for the different reform
   options was compared with physician practice characteristics.
   Results: The response rate was 48.5\% (n = 1222). Four of 5 physicians
   (78.4\%) indicated that under Medicare, some procedures are compensated
   too highly and others are compensated at rates insufficient to cover
   costs. Incentives were the most frequently supported reform option
   (49.1\%), followed by shifting payments (41.6\%) and bundling (17.2\%).
   Shifting payments and bundling were more commonly supported by
   generalists than by other specialists. There was broad support for
   increasing pay for generalists (79.8\%), but a proposal to offset the
   increase with a 3\% reduction in specialist reimbursement was supported
   by only 39.1\% of physicians.
   Conclusions: Physicians are dissatisfied with Medicare reimbursement and
   show little consensus for major proposals to reform reimbursement. The

Month = {{OCT 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: Monetary incentives are an effective way of increasing
   response rates to surveys, though they are generally less effective in

   Methods: In this study we examine the effectiveness of pre- and

Abstract = {{Background: Nursing Home Compare first published clinical quality
   measures at the end of 2002. It is a quality report card that for the
   first time offers consumers easily accessible information about the
   clinical quality of nursing homes. It led to changes in consumers'
   demand, increasing the relative importance of clinical versus hotel
   aspects of quality in their search and choice of a nursing home.
   Objectives: To examine the hypothesis that nursing homes responding to
   these changes in demand shifted the balance of resources from hotel to
   clinical activities.
   Subjects: The study included 10,022 free-standing nursing homes
   nationwide during 2001 to 2006.
   Research Design and Data: A retrospective multivariate statistical
   analysis of trends in the ratio of clinical to hotel expenditures, using
   Medicare cost reports, Minimum Data Set and Online Survey, Certification
   and Reporting data, controlling for changes in residents' acuity and
   facility fixed effects. Inference is based on robust standard errors.
   Results: The ratio of clinical to hotel expenditures averaged 1.78. It
   increased significantly (P < 0.001) by 5\% following the publication of
   the report card. The increase was larger and more significant among
   nursing homes with worse reported quality, lower occupancy, those
   located in more competitive markets, for-profit ownership and owned by a
   chain.
   Conclusions: The increase in the ratio of clinical to hotel expenditures
   following publication of the report card suggests that nursing homes
   responded as expected to the changes in the elasticity of demand with
   respect to clinical quality brought about by the public reporting of
   clinical quality measures. The response was stronger among nursing homes
   facing stronger incentives.}},

Abstract = {{This study expands upon existing knowledge of response rates by
   conducting a large-scale quantitative review of published response
   rates. This allowed a fine-grained comparison of response rates across
   respondent groups. Other unique features of this study are the analysis
   of response enhancing techniques across respondent groups and response
   rate trends over time. In order to aid researchers in designing surveys,
   we provide expected response rate percentiles for different survey
   modalities.
   We analyzed 2,037 surveys, covering 1,251,651 individual respondents,
   published in 12 journals in I/O Psychology, Management, and Marketing
   during the period 1995-2008. Expected response rate levels were
   summarized for different types of respondents and use of response
   enhancing techniques was coded for each study.
   First, differences in mean response rate were found across respondent
   types with the lowest response rates reported for executive respondents
   and the highest for non-working respondents and non-managerial
   employees. Second, moderator analyses suggested that the effectiveness
   of response enhancing techniques was dependent on type of respondents.
   Evidence for differential prediction across respondent type was found
   for incentives, salience, identification numbers, sponsorship, and
   administration mode. When controlling for increased use of response
   enhancing techniques, a small decline in response rates over time was
   found.
   Our findings suggest that existing guidelines for designing effective
   survey research may not always offer the most accurate information
   available. Survey researchers should be aware that they may obtain
   lower/higher response rates depending on the respondent type surveyed
   and that some response enhancing techniques may be less/more effective
   in specific samples.
   This study, analyzing the largest set of published response rates to
   date, offers the first evidence for different response rates and
   differential functioning of response enhancing techniques across
   respondent types.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Existing knowledge of evidence-based chronic disease
   prevention is not systematically disseminated or applied. This study
   investigated state and territorial chronic disease practitioners'
   self-reported barriers to evidence-based decision making (EBDM).
   Methods. In a nationwide survey, participants indicated the extent to
   which they agreed with statements reflecting four personal and five
   organizational barriers to EBDM. Responses were measured on a Likert
   scale from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating a larger barrier to
   EBDM. We analyzed mean levels of barriers and calculated adjusted odds
   ratios for barriers that were considered modifiable through
   interventions.
   Results. Overall, survey participants (n=447) reported higher scores for
   organizational barriers than for personal barriers. The largest reported
   barriers to EBDM were lack of incentives/rewards, inadequate funding, a
   perception of state legislators not supporting evidence-based
   interventions and policies, and feeling the need to be an expert on many
   issues. In adjusted models, women were more likely to report a lack of
   skills in developing evidence-based programs and in communicating with
   policy makers. Participants with a bachelor's degree as their highest
   degree were more likely than those with public health master's degrees
   to report lacking skills in developing evidence-based programs. Men,
   specialists, and individuals with doctoral degrees were all more likely
   to feel the need to be an expert on many issues to effectively make
   evidence-based decisions.
   Conclusions. Approaches must be developed to address organizational
   barriers to EBDM. Focused skills development is needed to address
   personal barriers, particularly for chronic disease practitioners
   without graduate-level training.}},

   Neither the amount of the incentive, nor the length of the survey

Abstract = {{Public discourse on migrant interactions with state welfare systems has
   often assumed exploitative motivations on the part of migrants, with
   charges of welfare tourism a recurring theme among segments of the
   political spectrum. Academic research has also tended to characterise
   migrant welfare utilisation in simple dichotomous terms where migrants
   are either `welfare dependent' or not. This article argues for the
   analytic utility of disaggregating the concept of welfare utilisation
   into distinct component parts, denoting usage, participation and
   dependency with regard to state-provided cash welfare benefits. Using EU
   survey data, these distinct components of welfare utilisation among
   migrants are assessed in comparative cross-national context, comparing
   welfare and labour market outcomes for similar cohorts of migrants faced
   with dissimilar incentive structures. The results have direct
   implications for policy-makers, and for migrant experiences of social
   citizenship, in so far as they show little support for the moral hazard
   view of migrant interactions with welfare systems. Migrants in Ireland's
   relatively more generous welfare system are seen to have no greater
   likelihood of welfare dependency, and in fact show a lower usage of
   welfare (as a proportion of total income) than similar migrants in
   Britain, controlling for characteristics. Intriguingly, however, the
   likelihood of forming a partial labour market attachment is seen to
   respond to increasing levels of welfare usage in Ireland, but not in
   Britain, suggesting that migrants may be taking an active role in how
   they define their position in the work-welfare nexus in response to
   welfare system incentives.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To understand factors associated with primary care physician
   research participation in a practice-based research network (PBRN) and
   to compare perspectives by specialty.
   Methods: We surveyed primary care internists, family physicians, and
   pediatricians in Monroe County, New York, regarding their past
   experience with research and incentives to participate in practice-based
   research. We performed descriptive and tabular analyses to assess
   perceptions and used chi(2) and analysis of variance to compare
   perceptions across the 3 specialties.
   Results: The response rate was 33\%. The most frequently endorsed
   aspects of collaboration were the opportunity to enact quality
   improvement (78\%), contribution to clinical knowledge (75\%), and
   intellectual stimulation (65\%). Significant differences among the
   primary care specialties were found in 2 aspects: (1) internists were
   more likely to endorse additional source of income as ``important,{''}
   and family medicine physicians were more likely to cite the opportunity

   Conclusion: Physicians across all 3 specialties cited the opportunity to
   enact quality improvement and contribution to clinical knowledge as
   important incentives to participating in practice-based research. This
   supports the importance of strengthening the interface between research

Volume = {{9}},

Pages = {{175-193}},

Abstract = {{Our ability to design public policies that effectively promote the
   efficient use of privately owned forest resources is underpinned by an
   understanding of the way in which forest production and investment
   decisions are made, and of how forest owners respond to changes in
   social, economic, and institutional conditions. A model of
   non-industrial private forest owners (NIPF) past harvesting behaviour
   and future harvesting intentions using a logit approach is presented. A
   Tobit model, which investigates harvesting intensity, is also developed.
   The responses to a survey of 386 NIPF owners in Tasmania are used to
   construct the data set consisting of socio-economic characteristics of
   NIPF owners, their forest ownership objectives, and property
   characteristics. The current study is innovative in that the role of
   NIPF owner objectives and attitudes is assessed in three econometric
   models exploring past harvesting behaviour, harvesting intensity, and
   future harvesting intentions. A series of observations can be made from
   comparing the results of the three models. For example, higher pulp
   prices are unlikely to affect NIPF owners harvesting intentions but are
   likely to increase harvesting intensity. The financial characteristics
   of the NIPF owner contribute most to predicting future harvesting
   intentions, with financial security being a disincentive to future
   harvesting. Landowner objectives and attitudes are important in
   explaining past harvesting activities and future intentions but do not
   significantly affect harvesting intensity. Furthermore, there are
   significant differences between different types of landowners in terms
   of the incentives that are likely to make them change their mind about
   participating in native forest harvesting.}},

Abstract = {{Nonresponse bias has been a long- standing issue in survey research
   (Brehm 1993; Dillman, Eltinge, Groves and Little 2002), with numerous
   studies seeking to identify factors that affect both item and unit
   response. To contribute to the broader goal of minimizing survey
   nonresponse, this study considers several factors that can impact survey
   nonresponse, using a 2007 Animal Welfare Survey Conducted in Ohio, USA.
   In particular, the paper examines the extent to which topic salience and
   incentives affect survey participation and item nonresponse, drawing on
   the leverage-saliency theory (Groves, Singer and Corning 2000). We find
   that participation in a survey is affected by its subject context (as
   this exerts either positive or negative leverage on sampled units) and
   prepaid incentives, which is consistent with the leverage-saliency
   theory. Our expectations are also confirmed by the finding that item
   nonresponse, our proxy for response quality, does vary by proximity to
   agriculture and the environment (residential location, knowledge about
   how food is grown, and views about the importance of animal welfare).
   However, the data suggests that item nonresponse does not vary according
   to whether or not a respondent received incentives.}},

Abstract = {{In response to concern about the loss of ecosystem services once
   provided by natural riparian systems, state and federal agencies have
   established incentive programs for landowners to convert sensitive lands
   from agricultural to conservation uses. Enhancement of wildlife habitat,
   while identified as a function of such systems, has often been of
   secondary importance to soil conservation and water quality objectives.
   Though greatly important, little consideration has been given to how
   specific species will respond to the design and management of riparian
   buffers or other conservation lands. This study compared avian
   communities within a chronosequence of riparian buffers established on
   previously cropped or pastured land with those of the nearby matrix land
   cover types (row crop fields and an intensively grazed pasture). The
   riparian buffers consisted of native grasses, forbs, and woody
   vegetation established at three different times (2, 9, and 14+ years
   prior to survey). At each site, 10 min point counts for breeding birds
   were conducted using 50 m fixed radius plots, which were visited eight
   times between May 15 and July 10, 2008. A total of 54 bird species were
   observed over all of the study sites. The re-established riparian
   buffers in this study had higher bird abundance, richness, and diversity
   than the crop and pasture sites. These results suggest that
   re-establishing native riparian vegetation in areas of intensive
   agriculture will provide habitat for a broad suite of bird species, but
   that specific species will reflect successional stage, horizontal and
   vertical vegetative structure, and compositional diversity of the buffer
   vegetation. These results emphasize the importance of matching buffer
   design and management to species requirements if the objectives are to
   attract specific target species or species groups.}},

Abstract = {{Response rates to surveys are decreasing. The purpose of this study was
   to evaluate the use of lottery tickets as incentives in an epidemiologic
   control group. A self-administered questionnaire was sent to parents in
   the municipality of Stockholm, Sweden, who were to be used as a control
   group in a study addressing stress in parents of children with cancer. A
   stratified random sample of 450 parents were randomized into three
   incentive groups: (a) no incentive; (b) a promised incentive of one
   lottery ticket to be received upon reply; (c) a promised incentive of
   one lottery ticket to be received upon reply and an additional lottery
   ticket upon reply within 1 week. The overall response rate across the
   three groups was 65.3\%. The response rate was highest in the no
   incentive group (69.3\%) and lowest in the one plus one lottery ticket
   group (62.0\%). In a survival analysis, the difference between the two
   response curves was significant by the log-rank test (P = 0.04), with
   the no incentive group having a shorter time to response than the
   incentive group. Our findings suggest that the use of lottery tickets as
   incentives to increase participation in a mail questionnaire among
   parents may be less valuable or even harmful. Incentives may undermine
   motivation in studies in which the intrinsic motivation of the
   respondents is already high.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The successful incorporation of research into the future
   careers of residents provides tremendous potential for increasing
   scientific orthopaedic inquiry and improving musculoskeletal care.
   Therefore, we sought to assess resident opinions regarding plans and
   incentives for future research and the opinions of academic chairs who
   must support them.
   Methods: Residents from sixteen departments were surveyed with a
   twenty-four-question online survey. Similar surveys were sent to chairs
   of all residency-sponsoring departments.
   Results: The response rate was 44\% (183) for the residents and 60\%
   (eighty-six) for the chairs. Forty-two percent of the residents felt
   certain or likely that they would perform research during their careers,
   and 28\% were undecided. Ninety-nine percent thought that orthopaedic
   surgeons performing research is important to clinical orthopaedics.
   Ninety-three percent of the residents expressed the need for monetary
   incentives for research, but only 40\% would help to provide it. Chairs
   similarly noted the importance of research subsidization (92\%) and a
   willingness to support it (70\%). Residents indicated that increased
   funding and protected time would provide the greatest incentives for
   research during residency; chairs agreed. After training, debt relief
   and salary support were most important for residents; chairs chose
   protected time and a chair who is supportive of research as most
   important. Primary authorship on a prior manuscript and past research
   experience were found to be associated with greater future research
   interest in univariate analyses; primary authorship maintained an
   independent association in multivariate analysis. Younger residents and
   women were more likely to be unsure of their research interest.
   Conclusions: Many orthopaedic residents in training have interest in
   integrating research into their future practice and support the research
   mission of orthopaedic surgeons. Our results may aid in identifying
   residents with high research interest (and those unsure) and help to
   guide the provision of incentives to actuate those interests.
   Clinical Relevance: Increasing the future research potential of
   residents will help to spur scientific investigation, which serves as
   the foundation for evidence-based clinical orthopaedic care.}},

Title = {{Effects of a Financial Incentive on Health Researchers' Response to an
   Online Survey: a Randomized Controlled Trial}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR-JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background: Nonresponse to questionnaires can affect the validity of
   surveys and introduce bias. Offering financial incentives can increase
   response rates to postal questionnaires, but the effect of financial
   incentives on response rates to online surveys is less clear.
   Objective: As part of a survey, we aimed to test whether knowledge of a
   financial incentive would increase the response rate to an online
   questionnaire.
   Methods: A randomized controlled trial of 485 UK-based principal
   investigators of publicly funded health services and population health
   research. Participants were contacted by email and invited to complete
   an online questionnaire via an embedded URL. Participants were randomly
   allocated to groups with either ``knowledge of{''} or ``no knowledge or
   a financial incentive (10 Amazon gift voucher) to be provided on
   completion of the survey. At the end of the study, gift vouchers were
   given to all participants who completed the questionnaire regardless of
   initial randomization status. Four reminder emails (sent from the same
   email address as the initial invitation) were sent out to nonrespondents
   at one, two, three, and four weeks; a fifth postal reminder was also
   undertaken. The primary outcome measure for the trial was the response
   rate one week after the second reminder. Response rate was also measured
   at the end of weeks one, two, three, four, and five, and after a postal
   reminder was sent.
   Results: In total, 243 (50\%) questionnaires were returned (232
   completed, 11 in which participation was declined). One week after the
   second reminder, the response rate in the ``knowledge{''} group was 27\%
   (66/244) versus 20\% (49/241) in the ``no knowledge{''} group (x(1)(2) =
   3.0, P = .08). The odds ratio for responding among those with knowledge
   of an incentive was 1.45 (95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 0.95 - 2.21).
   At the third reminder, participants in the ``no knowledge{''} group were
   informed about the incentive, ending the randomized element of the
   study. However we continued to follow up all participants, and from
   reminder three onwards, no significant differences were observed in the
   response rates of the two groups.
   Conclusions: Knowledge of a financial incentive did not significantly
   increase the response rate to an online questionnaire. Future surveys
   should consider including a randomized element to further test the
   utility of offering incentives of other types and amounts to participate
   in online questionnaires.}},

   Clinical article}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-PEDIATRICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Object. Deformational plagiocephaly (DP) is the leading cause of head
   shape abnormalities in infants. Treatment options include conservative
   measures and cranial molding. Pediatric neurosurgeons and craniofacial
   plastic surgeons have yet to agree on an ideal therapy, and no definable
   standards exist for initiating treatment with helmets. Furthermore,
   there may be differences between specialties in their perceptions of DP
   severity and need for helmet therapy.
   Methods. Requests to participate in a web-based questionnaire were sent
   to diplomates of the American Board of Pediatric Neurological Surgery
   and US and Canadian members of the Pediatric Joint Section of the
   American Association of Neurological Surgeons and the Congress of
   Neurological Surgeons and the American Cleft Palate Craniofacial
   Association. Questions focused on educational background; practice
   setting; volume of DP patients; preferences for evaluation, treatment,
   follow-up; and incentives or deterrents to treat with helmet therapy.
   Six examples of varying degrees of DP were presented to delineate
   treatment preferences.
   Results. Requests were sent to 302 neurosurgeons and 470 plastic
   surgeons, and responses were received from 71 neurosurgeons (24\%) and
   64 plastic surgeons (14\%). The following responses represented the
   greatest variations between specialties: 1) 8\% of neurosurgeons and
   26\% of plastic surgeons strongly agreed with the statement that helmet
   therapy is more beneficial than conservative therapy (p < 0.01); and 2)
   25\% of neurosurgeons and 58\% of plastic surgeons would treat moderate
   to severe DP with helmets (p < 0.01).
   Conclusions. Survey responses suggest that neurosurgeons are less likely
   to prescribe helmet therapy for DP than plastic surgeons. Parents of
   children with DP are faced with a costly treatment decision that may be
   influenced more strongly by referral and physician bias than medical
   evidence. (DOI: 10.3171/2009.11.PEDS0983)}},

Pages = {{290-293}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the teaching effort
   and associated resources across variously sized academic and nonacademic
   hospitals across the country.
   Methods: A simple survey was constructed and distributed nationally to
   academic and nonacademic radiology departments of attending-level
   radiologists with residency programs. The survey queried human and
   financial resources used for education in the department or division in
   comparison with compensated human and financial resources for this
   effort.
   Results: Sixty institutions across the country were surveyed, with 40
   surveys returned from 35 unique institutions, representing a 67\%
   response rate. All respondents reported performing teaching duties. The
   average teaching in departments was 30 hours per week, including
   teaching a wide scope of constituents, including trainees, colleagues,
   and allied staff members. The majority of teaching was spent on teaching
   medical students, residents, and fellows as well as referring physicians
   at multidisciplinary rounds. The commitment of dedicated full-time
   equivalent staff members and funding to teaching was limited, with 45\%
   of respondents without dedicated full-time equivalents for teaching and
   just over 7\% of the teaching funded. Eighty percent of institutions
   surveyed provided some amount of weekly academic time during which many
   staff members carried out their teaching preparations.
   Conclusions: Respondent radiology departments reported significant
   resource and manpower allocations to teaching efforts, in particular to
   trainees and referring physicians. However, limited compensation or
   incentives are allocated to this effort with regard to both human and
   financial resources. Compensated, allotted staff academic time may help
   offset the lack of dedicated educational resources to the teaching
   effort of radiology departments.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this qualitative study was to identify a common language

   survey was designed for telephone interviews with 26 businesses (
   Innovators) from the Board of the Center for Health Value Innovation; a
   paper-based survey with the same questions was completed by attendees at
   a seminar. Then, an online trend survey was conducted with members of
   the Board ( Innovators) to track the total health cost trends in their
   companies over the past 3-4 years. Responses were compared and analysis
   of alignment and differences were recorded by graphing. The trend survey
   results were mapped and tracked with weighted averages. Innovators'
   responses to the phone survey showed broader definitions of ``wellness''
   than other companies, with little difference in the Innovators'
   responses when subdivided by size of company. The online trend survey
   showed that companies that provided incentives for wellness averaged a
   trend of 4\% over the past 3-4 years-approximately 50\% of the national
   trends of 8\%-10\% over the same time frame. Innovators have defined
   wellness in ways that would accelerate adoption in the broader business
   community and drive implementation of wellness programs. The bigger win

Journal = {{RURAL AND REMOTE HEALTH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR-JUN}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Retention of rehabilitation therapists (RTs) in rural
   areas is a growing problem in rural Australia. Current literature
   demonstrates that private allied health professionals in general remain
   longer in rural areas than those working in the public sector. However,
   government focus to enhance retention has been on those employed in the
   public sector, offering private practitioners little incentive to stay
   rural. There has been an absence of policy commitment to attracting
   private professionals to rural areas or offering rural practitioners
   options for mixing private and public service. This study aimed to
   explore the thoughts and perceptions of private RTs in rural areas
   concerning their incorporation into broader rural health policies and
   concomitant programs.
   Methods: An online survey was sent to a purposively chosen sample of RTs
   in rural Victoria. Participants were selected from publicly available
   internet listings and were contacted via email. Possible participants
   were limited to those who had an email address and to those on three
   available professional lists (physiotherapy, occupational therapy and
   speech pathology). The survey consisted of 29 questions: eight related
   to the perceived place that practitioners in rural areas occupy; eight
   related to their professional practice; seven related to retention
   policies; two related to education and training; and four were
   demographic questions.
   Results: A total of 72 RTs completed the survey and were included in the
   analysis (40\% response rate). The overwhelming majority of respondents
   were in favour of having partnerships between private and public
   practice in rural and regional areas and of governments developing
   programs to facilitate such partnerships. In total, 26\% of respondents
   currently worked in some form of partnership with public agencies. There
   was also a reasonable response to the use of government incentives to
   retain and attract private practitioners to rural and regional areas.
   Conclusions: The results of this research indicate that many private RTs
   in Victoria perceived their greater involvement in the delivery of
   public health in rural areas in a positive manner.}},

Title = {{The ``Medicine in Australia: Balancing Employment and Life (MABEL){''}
   longitudinal survey - Protocol and baseline data for a prospective
   cohort study of Australian doctors' workforce participation}},
Journal = {{BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{FEB 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: While there is considerable research on medical workforce
   supply trends, there is little research examining the determinants of
   labour supply decisions for the medical workforce. The ``Medicine in
   Australia: Balancing Employment and Life (MABEL){''} study investigates
   workforce participation patterns and their determinants using a
   longitudinal survey of Australian doctors. It aims to generate evidence
   to support developing effective policy responses to workforce issues
   such as shortages and maldistribution. This paper describes the study
   protocol and baseline cohort, including an analysis of response rates
   and response bias.
   Methods/Design: MABEL is a prospective cohort study. All Australian
   doctors undertaking clinical work in 2008 (n = 54,750) were invited to
   participate, and annual waves of data collections will be undertaken
   until at least 2011. Data are collected by paper or optional online
   version of a questionnaire, with content tailored to four sub-groups of
   clinicians: general practitioners, specialists, specialists in training,
   and hospital non-specialists. In the baseline wave, data were collected
   on: job satisfaction, attitudes to work and intentions to quit or change
   hours worked; a discrete choice experiment examining preferences and
   trade-offs for different types of jobs; work setting; workload;
   finances; geographic location; demographics; and family circumstances.
   Discussion: The baseline cohort includes 10,498 Australian doctors,
   representing an overall response rate of 19.36\%. This includes 3,906
   general practitioners, 4,596 specialists, 1,072 specialists in training,
   and 924 hospital non-specialists. Respondents were more likely to be
   younger, female, and to come from non-metropolitan areas, the latter
   partly reflecting the effect of a financial incentive on response for
   doctors in remote and rural areas. Specialists and specialists in
   training were more likely to respond, whilst hospital non-specialists
   were less likely to respond. The distribution of hours worked was
   similar between respondents and data from national medical labour force
   statistics. The MABEL survey provides a large, representative cohort of
   Australian doctors. It enables investigation of the determinants of
   doctors' decisions about how much, where and in what circumstances they
   practice, and of changes in these over time. MABEL is intended to
   provide an important resource for policy makers and other stakeholders
   in the Australian medical workforce.}},

Abstract = {{Students' perception of their overall academic experience and the campus
   environment is related to academic accomplishment, and research has
   found that the designed environment of the university can influence the
   degree of stress students may feel. Past research found that
   undergraduate student use of campus green spaces and perceptions of
   quality of life were related to each other. The main objective of this
   study was to investigate the relationship between graduate student use
   of campus green spaces and their perceptions of quality of life at a
   university in Texas. A total of 347 of 3279 (approximate to 10\%) of the
   graduate student body received e-mails with information regarding the
   incentive for participation and instructions on accessing an on-line
   survey. The survey included questions that related to student use of
   campus green spaces, overall quality of life statements, an instrument
   to measure the quality of life of university students, and demographic
   questions. A total of 79 (22.8\% response rate) graduate student
   questionnaires were collected and analyzed to compare perceptions of
   quality of life of university students and the level of individual usage
   of campus green spaces. Descriptive statistics determined that, unlike
   undergraduates who were primarily ``high users{''} of campus green
   spaces, graduate students were about equally split between being
   ``low,{''} ``medium,{''} and ``high users{''} of campus green spaces.
   However, graduate students still ranked their quality of life highly.
   Finally, this study found that, unlike undergraduates, graduate students
   did not have a statistically significant relationship between green-user
   scores and perception of quality of life scores. It may be that graduate
   students have less time to spend in outdoor spaces, yet still meet their
   quality of life needs through other means such as academic achievements.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: To achieve high participation rates and a representative
   sample, active parent consent procedures require a significant
   investment of study resources. The purpose of this article is to
   describe processes and outcomes of utilizing active parent consent
   procedures with sixth-grade students from urban, ethnically diverse,
   economically disadvantaged K-8 public schools involved in an evaluation
   of a middle school service-learning program.
   METHODS: As part of the evaluation of the Lead Peace-Plus
   service-learning program, active parent consent was obtained for
   participation in school-based health surveys conducted with sixth
   graders in 3 schools. To achieve acceptable rates of parent permission,
   we employed multiple procedures including regular communication with
   school staff, incentives for involved schools and teachers, a
   multipronged approach for reaching parents, and direct encouragement of
   students to return forms through repeated classroom visits, individual
   and classroom incentives. We used Fisher's exact tests to compare
   selected characteristics among students whose parents weren't reached,
   those whose parents refused, and those whose parents consented to survey
   participation.
   RESULTS: We achieved a parent response rate of 94.6\% among sixth-grade
   students. No significant differences in student gender, race/ethnicity,
   school, or free/reduced lunch status were identified across parent
   consent status groups. Rates of absenteeism were significantly higher (p
   = .03) among students whose parents weren't reached compared to other
   groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: Employing a multifaceted active parent consent campaign can
   result in high rates of parental response with limited sampling bias
   among an urban, ethnically diverse and economically disadvantaged group
   of middle school students.}},

Abstract = {{Most analyses of the effect of incentives on response rates have
   attempted to extrapolate to the Internet the already existing broad
   knowledge base of methodologies for personal surveys by telephone and
   post. However, Such knowledge about existing methods is not directly
   applicable to the Internet-based interviews. This Study therefore
   examines the manner in which different combinations of incentives can
   affect response to a survey over the Internet. With Such a purpose
   incentives have been chosen based on draws that has been administered
   under the pre-incentives philosophy (giving the possibility to
   participate in a draw, independently that the questionnaire was stuffed
   or not) or post-incentives (giving the possibility to participate in a
   draw only those that stuffed the questionnaire). A surprising result is
   that the joint use of pre-incentives and post-incentives slightly
   improves response rates, although it also Causes rates to be
   considerably lower than when these incentives are used separately.}},

   Decision Support in e-Prescribing (CDS-eP) adoption in the West of
   Ireland: a cross sectional study}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{JAN 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: Electronic clinical decision support (CDS) is increasingly
   establishing its role in evidence-based clinical practice. Considerable
   evidence supports its enhancement of efficiency in e-Prescribing, but
   some controversy remains. This study evaluated the practicality and
   identified the perceived benefits of, and barriers to, its future
   adoption in the West of Ireland.
   Methods: This cross sectional study was carried out by means of a
   27-part questionnaire sent to 262 registered general practitioners in
   Counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon. The survey domains encompassed
   general information of individual's practice, current use of CDS and the
   practitioner's attitudes towards adoption of CDS-eP. Descriptive and
   inferential analyses were performed to analyse the data collected.
   Results: The overall response rate was 37\%. Nearly 92\% of respondents
   employed electronic medical records in their practice. The majority
   acknowledged the value of electronic CDS in improving prescribing
   quality (71\%) and reducing prescribing errors (84\%). Despite a high
   degree of unfamiliarity (73\%), the practitioners were open to the use
   of CDS-eP (94\%) and willing to invest greater resources for its
   implementation (62\%). Lack of a strategic implementation plan (78\%) is
   the main perceived barrier to the incorporation of CDS-eP into clinical
   practice, followed by i) lack of financial incentives (70\%), ii) lack
   of standardized product software (61\%), iii) high sensitivity of
   drug-drug interaction or medication allergy markers (46\%), iv) concern
   about overriding physicians' prescribing decisions(44\%) and v) lack of
   convincing evidence on the systems' effectiveness (22\%).
   Conclusions: Despite favourable attitudes towards the adoption of
   CDS-eP, multiple perceived barriers impede its incorporation into
   clinical practice. These merit further exploration, taking into
   consideration the structure of the Irish primary health care system,
   before CDS-eP can be recommended for routine clinical use in the West of
   Ireland.}},

Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{691-707}},
Abstract = {{Like many of its neighbours. Thailand is increasingly interested in
   upgrading the technological capability of its indigenous firms through
   the inward investment (foreign direct investment, FDI) of transnational
   enterprises (TNEs). Its science and technology policies, however, remain
   fragmented, and they compete with regional distribution priorities. This
   paper examines the nature of technology transfer between Asian TNEs
   (Japan and the newly industrializing economies (NIEs), that is, the NIEs
   of Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan) and Thai firms based on
   the responses of some 145 firms from a 2005 survey. It finds only modest
   levels of technological transfer in production and process technologies.
   Asian TNEs evaluate factor cost advantages and government incentives
   favourably. Logistic regressions, however, indicate that government
   incentives are negatively related to technology process modification
   between NIE subsidiaries and Thai customers. But, the technical training
   of Thai workers significantly increases the likelihood of Asian
   subsidiaries undertaking process technology transfers. Among NIE firms,
   the ability to import foreign skilled labour further increases the
   likelihood of such technological activities. Finally, forward linkages
   among the NIEs are positively associated with fill?, location in the
   urban agglomerations of Bangkok and Chon Buri, and, among smaller firms.
   Our study suggests that prevailing FDI policies have little influence on
   technology transfer, while technology policies that favour large TNEs
   work against smaller NIEs that are engaged in modest technology
   transfer.}},

Abstract = {{Are economic incentives and regulatory relief useful tools for

   asked to choose between pairs of hypothetical projects in three Venice

   pertaining to organizational elements that were expected to change. The
   evidence suggested that privatization brought about important alignments
   among the organization's goals, design elements and resources and
   between the organization and Its competitive environment.
   Practical implications - The implications of the study are discussed in
   relation to the organizational changes that take place in the transition
   from public to private sector ownership The study contributes to our
   understanding about the relationship between ownership-performance by
   providing an organizational change perspective on the examination of

Abstract = {{The Greater Cincinnati Household Travel Survey (HTS) is a
   proof-of-concept study for replacing travel diaries with a large-scale
   multi-day Global Positioning System (GPS) survey. The objectives are to
   collect multiple-day data from more than 3,000 households with portable
   GPS devices and improve existing processing software to provide data
   that support modeling approaches in Ohio. No diaries are collected for
   household members younger than 12 years old. A subsample of follow-up
   prompted recall surveys allow respondents to review GPS interpreted
   travel information for verification. This paper, with data from the
   spring 2009 pilot, describes the survey process developed for this HTS.
   It documents that with an address-based sample frame, advance letters,
   and Internet and phone recruiting, a significant subsample of cell phone
   only households can be recruited and surveyed with GPS; a representative
   sample of households can be recruited for a GPS-based survey, based on a
   comparison of pilot sample household characteristics with available
   Public Use Microdata Samples data; and response rates for
   difficult-to-reach households such as cell phone only, lower income, and
   zero-vehicle households can be improved with a cash incentive (\$25).
   The paper provides principles and describes the prompted recall survey
   developed to obtain additional data from a subset of respondents beyond
   the GPS recorded travel for improving imputation software.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2010}},
Number = {{2187}},
Pages = {{76-84}},
Abstract = {{A route-based incentive program is introduced in which drivers are
   rewarded for taking the safest routes. The program is operated with an
   incentive structure by a logistics company and a variable insurance
   premium scheme by an insurance company. The logistics company offers
   incentives to its drivers to follow the safest routes and by doing so
   expects to pay lower insurance premiums for its vehicles. The insurance
   company charges a discounted premium for vehicles that follow the safest
   routes, while expecting to pay less for potential accident claims. The
   theoretical framework, including the setup of the incentive structure
   and the variable premium scheme, is presented in this paper. Conditions
   for the existence of a win win situation are established in which
   drivers, the logistics company, and the insurance company all benefit
   from the program. Optimization of the incentive program is also
   formulated as a bilevel programming problem. An online before-and-after
   survey is conducted to assess drivers' response to incentives.
   Forty-five Dutch professional drivers participated in the survey. The
   results show that drivers tend to ignore safety-related information in
   making their route choices; however, the incentives have some
   significant effects on these choices. The incentives therefore present
   an effective way of influencing drivers' route choices.}},

Title = {{Collecting household water usage data: telephone questionnaire or diary?}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA), a modelling
   approach, is used to assess health risks. Inputs into the QMRA process
   include data that characterise the intensity, frequency and duration of
   exposure to risk(s). Data gaps for water exposure assessment include the
   duration and frequency of urban non-potable (non-drinking) water use.
   The primary objective of this study was to compare household water usage
   results obtained using two data collection tools, a computer assisted
   telephone interview (CATI) and a 7-day water activity diary, in order to
   assess the effect of different methodological survey approaches on
   derived exposure estimates. Costs and logistical aspects of each data
   collection tool were also examined.
   Methods: A total of 232 households in an Australian dual reticulation
   scheme (where households are supplied with two grades of water through
   separate pipe networks) were surveyed about their water usage using both
   a CATI and a 7-day diary. Householders were questioned about their use
   of recycled water for toilet flushing, garden watering and other outdoor
   activities. Householders were also questioned about their water use in
   the laundry. Agreement between reported CATI and diary water usage
   responses was assessed.
   Results: Results of this study showed that the level of agreement
   between CATI and diary responses was greater for more frequent
   water-related activities except toilet flushing and for those activities
   where standard durations or settings were employed. In addition, this
   study showed that the unit cost of diary administration was greater than
   for the CATI, excluding consideration of the initial selection and
   recruitment steps.
   Conclusion: This study showed that it is possible to successfully
   `remotely' coordinate diary completion providing that adequate
   instructions are given and that diary recording forms are well designed.
   In addition, good diary return rates can be achieved using a monetary
   incentive and the diary format allows for collective recording, rather
   than an individual's estimation, of household water usage. Accordingly,
   there is merit in further exploring the use of diaries for collection of
   water usage information either in combination with a mail out for
   recruitment, or potentially in the future with Internet-based
   recruitment (as household Internet uptake increases).}},

Abstract = {{Fishers' attitudes and perceptions are critical for the success of
   fisheries protection areas with their associated biota. and a failure to
   understand fishers' behaviour may undermine the success of such
   fisheries management measures. In this study, we examine fishers'
   perception of a long-established exclusive fisheries zone around Malta
   and to investigate if the perceptions depend on fishers' demographic,
   economic, social characteristics and fishing activity of the fishers. A
   questionnaire survey was undertaken to evaluate the demographic
   characteristics, economic situation (costs and revenue) and fishers'
   activity and behaviour, together with their perception of the Fisheries
   Management Zone (FMZ). A total of 241 interview responses were analysed
   which was a response rate of 60\%. The perception of most fishers was
   that the establishment of the FMZ has had an overall negative impact on
   their fishing activity and that the zone is not important for the
   protection of local fish stocks. When asked about the beneficial effect
   of the zone for fishers, most fishers from all backgrounds said that the
   zone does not benefit commercial fishers, but benefits mainly
   recreational fishers. The most evident differences in the perceptions
   and attitudes were between the full-time, part-time and recreational
   fishers. Fishers that have been fishing for more than 35 years and
   fishers from the main fishing village also had different attitudes from
   other fishers towards the FMZ. The results of this study suggest that
   the proportion of individual income derived from fishing was the
   strongest factor that influenced attitudinal differences, with home port
   and fishing experience having less important effects. The main
   differences in attitude among fishers were related to the protection and
   conservation effects of the zone, enhancement of resources and conflicts
   among user groups. The heterogeneity among fishers' attitudes revealed
   by the present study has important implications for the implementation
   of spatial closures. Some sectors of stakeholders may require additional
   incentives to accept restrictions on access if spatial management is to
   achieve its intended objectives. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Background: Optimizing participant response rates is important for
   obtaining representative samples and the timely completion of studies.
   It is a common practice to use participant incentives to boost response
   rates, but few studies have systematically examined their effectiveness,
   particularly among minority groups.
   Methods: We experimentally tested three incentive strategies for their
   effectiveness in improving response rates among colorectal cancer cases
   (n = 3,816) and their relatives (n = 2,353). A 2 x 2 x 2 factorial
   design compared (a) registered versus first class mail, (b) \$5 cash
   with the initial mailing (yes/no), and (c) \$20 promise (yes/no) upon
   completion of the information form (for cases) or \$10 promise (yes/no)
   upon completion of the baseline survey (for relatives). Outcome measures
   were provision of contact information on first-degree relatives for
   cases and completion of the baseline survey for relatives.
   Results: The response rate among cases was low in all ethnic groups
   (28-37\%) and incentive strategies did not have an effect. Among
   relatives, the overall baseline survey response rate was 71\%, ranging
   from 66\% among Asians to 76\% among Whites. Modest absolute increases
   were observed for payment schedules that included a \$5 cash enclosure
   with the initial mailing in the total sample {[}odds ratio (OR), 1.65
   and 1.47] and among Latinos (OR, 1.94 and 1.74) but not among Asians
   (OR, 1.61 and 1.55) or African Americans (OR, 1.19 and 1.02). Response
   rates were not influenced by registered versus first-class mailing.
   Conclusion: The effects of incentives in this study were modest with
   some suggestion of differences by ethnic group and type of incentive.

Abstract = {{Background:
   Nationally health systems are making increasing investments in the use
   of clinical information systems. Little is known about current computer
   use by specialist physicians, particularly outside the hospital setting.
   Aims:
   To identify the extent and reasons physician Fellows of the Royal
   Australasian College of Physicians (RACP) use computers in their work.
   Methods:
   A self-administered survey was emailed from the RACP to all practising
   physicians in 2007 that were living in Australia and New Zealand who had
   consented to email contact with the College.
   Results:
   The survey was sent to a total of 7445 eligible physicians, 2328
   physicians responded (31.3\% response rate), but only 1266 responses
   (21.0\%) were able to be analysed. Most 97.5\% had access to computers
   at work and 96.5\% used home computers for work purposes. Physicians in
   public hospitals (72.6\%) were more likely to use computers for work
   (65.6\%) than those in private hospitals (12.6\%) or consulting rooms
   (27.3\%). Overall physicians working in public hospitals used a wider
   range of applications with 70.5\% using their computers for searching
   the internet, 53.7\% for receiving results and 52.7\% used their
   computers to engage in specific educational activities. Physicians
   working from their consulting rooms (33.6\%) were more likely to use
   electronic prescribing (11\%) compared with physicians working in public
   hospitals (5.7\%).
   Conclusions:
   Fellows have not incorporated computers into their consulting rooms over
   which they have control. This is in contrast to general practitioners
   who have embraced computers after the provision of various incentives.
   The rate of use of computers by physicians for electronic prescribing in
   consulting rooms (11\%) is very low in comparison with general
   practitioners (98\%). One reason may be that physicians work in multiple
   locations whereas general practitioners are more likely to work from one
   location.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To assess the robustness of patient responses to a new
   national survey of patient experience as a basis for providing financial
   incentives to doctors.
   Design Analysis of the representativeness of the respondents to the GP
   Patient Survey compared with those who were sampled (5.5 million
   patients registered with 8273 general practices in England in January
   2009) and with the general population. Analysis of non-response bias
   looked at the relation between practice response rates and scores on the
   survey. Analysis of the reliability of the survey estimated the
   proportion of the variance of practice scores attributable to true
   differences between practices.
   Results The overall response rate was 38.2\% (2.2 million responses),
   which is comparable to that in surveys using similar methodology in the
   UK. Men, young adults, and people living in deprived areas were
   under-represented among respondents. However, for questions related to
   pay for performance, there was no systematic association between
   response rates and questionnaire scores. Two questions which triggered
   payments to general practitioners were reliable measures of practice
   performance, with average practice-level reliability coefficients of
   93.2\% and 95.0\%. Less than 3\% and 0.5\% of practices had fewer than
   the number of responses required to achieve conventional reliability
   levels of 90\% and 70\%. A change to the payment formula in 2009
   resulted in an increase in the average impact of random variation in
   patient scores on payments to general practitioners compared with
   payments made in 2007 and 2008.
   Conclusions There is little evidence to support the concern of some
   general practitioners that low response rates and selective non-response
   bias have led to systematic unfairness in payments attached to
   questionnaire scores. The study raises issues relating to the validity
   and reliability of payments based on patient surveys and provides
   lessons for the UK and for other countries considering the use of
   patient experience as part of pay for performance schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. We sought to identify the incentives most likely to
   encourage voluntary participation in the national public health
   accreditation model.
   Methods. We reviewed existing incentives, held meetings with key
   informants, and conducted a survey of state and local public health

   departments and a sample of local health departments. Group-specific
   differences in survey responses were examined.
   Results. Survey response rates were 51\% among state health department
   representatives and 49\% among local health department representatives.
   Both state health department and local health department respondents
   rated financial incentives for accredited agencies, financial incentives
   for agencies considering accreditation, and infrastructure and quality
   improvement as important incentives. State health department respondents
   also indicated that grant administration and grant application would
   encourage their participation in the national accreditation model, and
   local health department respondents also noted that technical assistance

Journal = {{DRUG AND ALCOHOL REVIEW}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Introduction and Aims. As medical practitioners of the future, medical
   students should be taught about tobacco control strategies and smoking
   cessation interventions. By including education about tobacco in the
   medical curricula, they can be informed about the health effects of
   tobacco use and learn to assist smokers to quit. Our study aimed to
   estimate the extent of teaching about tobacco and smoking cessation
   techniques in medical schools worldwide and compare with results we
   reported 10 years ago, to determine the content of curricula and range
   of teaching formats and to identify barriers to teaching about tobacco
   in medical schools and solutions. Design and Methods. A cross-sectional
   survey of all existing medical schools (n = 2090) in 171 countries was
   conducted. A questionnaire was designed, translated and sent to all
   medical schools. Main outcome measures included whether and how tobacco
   is taught; comparisons with the survey conducted 10 years ago; tobacco
   content in the curriculum; format of teaching; and barriers to teaching
   and solutions. Results. 665 medical schools from 109 countries completed
   the full questionnaire, with a response rate of 31.8\% from medical
   schools and 64\% of countries and consisting of 39\% of medical schools
   in developed and 28\% in less developed countries. A further 67 medical
   schools responded to a single question on whether they taught about
   tobacco. The total response rate was 35\%. Of 561 medical schools
   responding to questions on teaching options, 27\% of medical schools
   taught a specific module on tobacco compared with only 11\% in our
   survey of medical schools conducted a decade ago; 77\% integrated
   teaching on tobacco with other topics compared with 40\% 10 years ago;
   31\% taught about tobacco informally as the topic arose (vs. 58\%) and
   4\% did not teach about tobacco (vs. 12\%). Most common topics taught
   were: health effects of smoking (94\%), health effects of passive
   smoking (84.5\%), epidemiology of tobacco use (81\%), nicotine
   dependence (78\%) and taking a smoking history (75\%). Most popular
   method of teaching was by lectures (78\%), case study discussions and
   problem-based learning exercises (51\%), class readings 46\%, in the
   clinical setting with real patients (45\%), special projects and
   assignments (45\%) and patient-centred teaching approaches, such as role
   plays (31\%). Significantly, more barriers to teaching were identified
   by less developed countries (> 60\%) including: lack of available
   teaching time in the medical program, limited organisational ability to
   include new subjects, lack of staff resources to teach, lack of current
   plans to introduce a tobacco curriculum, lack of a key person to
   champion and organise teaching, lack of financial resources and lack of
   incentives or advantages to teach. A majority described solutions to
   these problems. A case study of education on tobacco throughout the
   medical curriculum is presented. Discussion and Conclusions. We found an
   encouraging increase in the extent of teaching on tobacco in medical
   schools over 10 years. We report that although progress has been made to
   address the teaching of tobacco in medical schools worldwide, there is a
   great deal more effort required so that education on tobacco is an
   ongoing part of medical curricula. The teaching content is generally
   based on evidence-based smoking cessation guidelines. {[}Richmond R,

   less familiar with the survey subject. Finally, results indicate that
   incentives had very little effect on item nonresponse. Instead, item
   nonresponse was driven by education level, gender, and familiarity with
   the survey subject. However, combining the findings on sample
   composition with those of item nonresponse, it appears that the use of

Title = {{Asthma self-assessment in a Medicaid population}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JUL 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: Self-assessment of symptoms by patients with chronic
   conditions is an important element of disease management. A recent study
   in a commercially-insured population found that patients who received
   automated telephone calls for asthma self-assessment felt they
   benefitted from the calls. Few studies have evaluated the effectiveness
   of disease self-assessment in Medicaid populations. The goals of this
   study were to: (1) assess the feasibility of asthma self-assessment in a
   population predominantly insured by Medicaid, (2) study whether adding a
   gift card incentive increased completion of the self-assessment survey,
   and (3) evaluate how the self-assessment affected processes and outcomes
   of care.
   Methods: We studied adults and children aged 4 years and older who were
   insured by a Medicaid-focused managed care organization (MCO) in a pre-
   and post-intervention study. During the pre- incentive period, patients
   with computerized utilization data that met specific criteria for
   problematic asthma control were mailed the Asthma Control Test (ACT), a
   self-assessment survey, and asked to return it to the MCO. During the
   intervention period, patients were offered a \$20 gift card for
   returning the completed ACT to the MCO. To evaluate clinical outcomes,
   we used computerized claims data to assess the number of hospitalization
   visits and emergency department visits experienced in the 3 months after
   receiving the ACT. To evaluate whether the self-management intervention
   improved processes of care, we conducted telephone interviews with
   patients who returned or did not return the ACT by mail.
   Results: During the pre- incentive period, 1183 patients were identified
   as having problems with asthma control; 25 (2.0\%) of these returned the
   ACT to the MCO. In contrast, during the incentive period, 1612 patients
   were identified as having problems with asthma control and 87 (5.4\%) of
   these returned the ACT to the MCO (p<0.0001). Of all 95 ACTs that were
   returned, 87\% had a score of 19 or less, which suggested poor asthma
   control.
   During the 3 months after they received the ACT, patients who completed
   it had similar numbers of outpatient visits, emergency department
   visits, and hospitalizations for asthma as patients who did not complete
   the ACT. We completed interviews with 95 patients, including 28 who had
   completed the ACT and 67 who had not. Based on an ACT administered at
   the time of the interview, patients who had previously returned the ACT
   to the MCO had asthma control similar to those who had not (mean scores
   of 14.2 vs. 14.6, p=0.70). Patients had similar rates of contacting
   their providers within the past 2 months whether they had completed the
   mailed ACT or not (71\% vs. 76\%, p=0.57).
   Conclusion: Mailing asthma self-assessment surveys to patients with
   poorly controlled asthma was not associated with better
   asthma-associated outcomes or processes of care in the Medicaid
   population studied. Adding a gift card incentive did not meaningfully
   increase response rates. Asthma disease management programs for Medicaid
   populations will most likely need to involve alternative strategies for
   engaging patients and their providers in managing their conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The ethanol industry is growing in response to increased consumer
   demands for fuel as well as the renewable fuel standard. Corn ethanol
   processing creates the following products: 1/3 ethanol, 1/3 distillers
   grains, and 1/3 carbon dioxide. As the production of ethanol increases
   so does the generation of its coproducts, and viable uses continually
   need to be developed. A survey was mailed to operational US ethanol
   plants to determine current practices. It inquired about processes,
   equipment used, end products, and desired future directions for
   coproducts. Results indicated that approximately one-third of plant
   managers surveyed expressed a willingness to alter current drying time
   and temperature if it could result in a higher quality coproduct. Other
   managers indicated hesitation. based on lack of economic incentives,
   potential cost and return, and capital required. Respondents also
   reported the desire to use their coproducts in some of the following
   products: fuels, extrusion, pellets, plastics, and human food
   applications. These results provide a snapshot of the industry, and
   indicate that operational changes to the current production of DDGS must
   be based upon the potential for positive economic returns. Published by

Abstract = {{To understand one of the predominant groups supporting people with
   disabilities and illness, this study examined the profile of New Zealand
   paid caregivers, including their training needs.
   Paid caregivers, also known as healthcare assistants, caregivers and
   home health aides, work across several long-term care settings, such as
   residential homes, continuing-care hospitals and also private homes.
   Their roles include assisting with personal care and household
   management. New Zealand, similar to other countries, is facing a health
   workforce shortage.
   A three-phased design was used: phase I, a survey of all home-based and
   residential care providers (N = 942, response rate = 45\%); phase II, a
   targeted survey of training needs (n = 107, response = 100\%); phase
   III, four focus groups and 14 interviews with 36 providers, exploring
   themes arising from phases I and II.
   Findings on 17 910 paid caregivers revealed a workforce predominantly
   female (94\%), aged between 40 and 50, with 6\% over the age of 60. Mean
   hourly pay NZ\$10.90 (minimum wage NZ\$10.00 approx. UK3.00 at time of
   study) and 24 hours per week. The national paid caregiver turnover was
   29\% residential care and 39\% community. Most providers recognised the
   importance of training, but felt their paid caregivers were not
   adequately trained. Training was poorly attended; reasons cited were
   funding, family, secondary employment, staff turnover, low pay and few
   incentives.
   The paid caregiver profile described reflects trends also observed in
   other countries. There is a clear policy direction in New Zealand and
   other countries to support people with a disability at home, and yet the
   workforce which is facilitating this vision is itself highly vulnerable.
   Paid caregivers have minimum pay, are female, work part-time and
   although it is recognised that training is important for them, they do
   not attend, so consequently remain untrained.}},

   a physician. Fixed effects regression results reveal that physicians

Abstract = {{The welfare state faces a number of challenges. Recent reforms in the UK
   appear broadly successful in attaining targets and improving
   cost-efficiency, but are nonetheless confronted by public disquiet and
   unease. This article argues that one difficulty with the new directions
   in policy is that they rest on a particular and limited understanding of
   agency. Reformers tend to operate within a theoretical framework that
   understands behaviour as driven by individual and predominantly rational
   incentives and pays little attention to the expressive and normative
   aspects of social action. The problems that arise in these areas when a
   competitive market logic is applied in social provision tend not to be
   recognised. Such it logic may contradict established values of social
   care and commitment to user interests. A qualitative survey Of 48
   members of the general public is used to examine perceptions of and
   responses to the NHS reforms, and to show how public discourse in this
   area is at variance with the instrumental and individual assumptions of
   policy-makers. The result is that the reform programme damages the
   legitimacy of the service and that those responsible for the new
   policies fail to recognise that the individual instrumental agenda is
   eroding public trust.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores how the elimination of Madagascar's Vanilla

   reduction in poverty and a muted supply response. A counterfactual
   analysis based on the observed reduction in intermediation margins shows
   that, however limited, increase in competition among intermediaries has
   contributed to raise purchase prices and the cash income of vanilla
   farmers. After taking into account the reduction in Madagascar's
   monopoly power on the world vanilla market implied by the elimination of
   the VMB, the induced rise in producer prices is estimated to have lifted
   about 20,000 individuals out of poverty.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To gauge the faculty's understanding and perceptions of a
   recently implemented academic incentive plan (AIP) to encourage

   Design, Setting, and Participants: Surveys were administered to faculty
   at a university teaching hospital before and after allocation of the
   incentive during the inaugural implementation of an AIP.
   Main Outcome Measure: Survey Likert scale.
   Results: Preallocation and postallocation survey response rates were
   64\% and 67\%, respectively. Although 92\% of respondents submitted the
   required self-reports of academic activities, only 25\% met with their
   chiefs to assess productivity. Despite the small incentive, more than
   50\% believed that the AIP encouraged them to increase academic pursuits
   and rewarded activities important to the department that had not
   previously been reimbursed. Most did not believe that teaching, clinical
   research, or citizenship were adequately compensated before or after AIP
   implementation. However, more thought that citizenship (P=.02) and
   administration (P=.001) were adequately compensated in the
   postallocation vs preallocation survey; there were similar trends for
   clinical research (P=.17) and teaching (P=.06). Among 25 respondents who
   provided additional comments, 52\% mentioned a lack of transparency in
   the method of incentive distribution as a concern.
   Conclusions: Although only a few met with their chiefs for assessment,
   most faculty believed that even a minimal financial incentive might
   encourage them to increase their academic activities. We are encouraged
   to continue the AIP as a positive motivator for academic pursuits, and

Abstract = {{Despite acute staffing shortages in social work, workforce planning

   intelligence. This study aimed to inform the evidence base providing new
   data on recruitment and retention in Wales, examining what personal and
   organizational characteristics are associated with intentions to leave,
   and what initiatives or incentives might mediate that effect. A
   multi-method design facilitated comparisons between two data sources - a
   census of all 22 Welsh local authority employers about recruitment and
   retention practices and a survey of all social workers and senior
   practitioners employed in social services (n = 998; response rate
   45.9\%) about demography, workforce characteristics, working patterns,
   morale and plans and reasons for leaving one's job. Vacancy (mean
   14.4\%) and turnover (mean 15\%) rates were statistically significantly
   higher in children's services than in adult services; vacancy rates were
   also higher in authorities that offered higher starting salaries. The
   provision of certain types of traineeship might also be associated with
   higher vacancy rates but these results should be treated with some
   caution. There was little evidence that recruitment and retention
   initiatives were associated with lower vacancy or turnover rates,
   despite employers' perceptions about their effectiveness. Social workers
   derived a lot of satisfaction from their work, but more than a quarter
   wanted to leave their job within 6 months, and almost as many were
   actively seeking alternative employment. Intention to leave was
   explained by job and employer satisfaction, and negative feelings about
   pay. Senior practitioners and staff members with longer lengths of
   service were less likely to want to leave, even if they were
   dissatisfied with their job or employer. Job and employer
   dissatisfaction was associated with retention initiatives related to
   facilities, good caseload management and home-working, suggesting that
   dissatisfied staff might remain in employment for longer if these
   initiatives were in place.}},

Abstract = {{We provide an overview of survey design and implementation strategies in
   orthopaedic surgery. Health-care surveys are vital for obtaining
   information on the beliefs, patterns of practice, attitudes, and
   behaviors of orthopaedic surgeons. It is important to obtain a high
   response rate from administered surveys to reduce bias due to
   nonresponse. Researchers should follow the guidelines provided by this
   review to increase the response rate of orthopaedic surgeons to surveys.
   When designing these surveys, the researcher must consider length,
   format, and aesthetics. In addition, the types of questions that are
   included, the wording of these questions, and the order in which the
   questions are presented within the survey need to be carefully
   considered. Surveys can be administered by telephone, mail, facsimile
   (fax), and electronically by e-mail or Internet. The use of a mixed-mode
   method is recommended to improve the response rate. To increase the
   response rate to surveys that are directed at health professionals, a
   number of strategies have been suggested, including using cover letters,
   personalizing the cover letter and survey package, pretesting the cover
   letter and survey, contacting the surgeons prior to administration of
   the survey, contacting the surgeons multiple times, using stamped return
   envelopes in mail surveys, using appropriate survey packaging styles,
   providing incentives, and ensuring that the orthopaedic surgeon
   recognizes the sender of the survey. The costs associated with each
   administration method are briefly discussed, and ethical considerations
   are reviewed.}},

Abstract = {{Recent strategies employed in response to military physician recruitment
   shortfalls have consisted of increasing financial incentives for
   students in the Health Professions Scholarship Program (HPSP) while
   offering no increased incentive for attendance at the Uniformed Services
   University of the Health Sciences (USUHS). To gauge the impact of these
   incentive increases on the decision of medical students to attend USUHS,
   a prospective e-mail survey of current USUHS medical students was
   conducted. The survey was distributed to 674 USUHS medical students from
   all four class years, of which 41\% responded. Students were asked to
   prioritize incentives and disincentives for military service and USUHS,
   as well as respond to whether recent incentives applied solely to the
   HPSP would have affected their decision to attend USUHS. Data were
   assessed using a weighted scale with responses ranked highest receiving
   a score of 3, responses ranked second receiving a weighted score of 2,
   and those ranked third receiving a weighted score of I. The total
   weighted sum for each question response across the respondent population
   was then tallied in aggregate and assigned a weighted score to identify
   factors consistently ranked highest among the students. Patriotic duty
   and serving uniformed personnel were ranked most appealing about
   military service. Combat and deployment considerations were ranked least
   appealing about military service. Also of note, numerous survey comment
   box responses highlighted the perceived advantages of pooling resources
   between the two programs to benefit military medical student recruitment
   and training. Survey results suggested that current enhanced financial
   incentives and shorter service obligation offered by the HPSP make
   attendance of USUHS less appealing for current USUHS students and may
   negatively impact recruitment and retention of USUHS medical officers.
   Commensurate incentives such as promotion and credit for time in service
   while attending USUHS were identified by current USUHS medical students
   as a possible means of improving USUHS appeal.}},

   association (IPA) physician organizations with 20 or more physicians in
   the United States in 2006 to 2007. The response rate Was 60.3\%,. Use of
   19 CIT capabilities was measured. Multivariate statistical analysis of
   financial and organizational factors associated with adoption and use of
   CIT.
   Results: Use of information technology varied across physician
   organizations, including electronic access to laboratory test results
   (medical groups. 49.3\%; IPAs. 19.6\%), alerts for potential drug
   interactions (medical groups. 33.9\%; IPAs, 9.5\%), electronic drug
   prescribing (medical groups. 41.9\%: IPAs, 25.1\%), and physician use of
   e-mail with patients (medical groups, 34.2\%; IPAs, 29.1\%). Adoption of
   CIT was stronger for physician organizations evaluated by external
   entities for pay-for-performance and public reporting purposes (P =
   0.042) and for those participating in quality improvement initiatives (P
   < 0.001).
   Discussion: External incentives and participation in quality improvement
   initiatives are associated with greater use of CIT by large physician
   practices.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid pace of wind power development in the USA over the lost decade
   has outstripped the ability of most project developers to provide
   adequate equity capital and to make efficient use of project-related tax
   benefits. In response, the sector has created novel project financing
   structures that feature varying combinations of equity capital from
   project developers and third-party tax-oriented investors and, in some
   cases, commercial debt. While their origins stem from variations in the
   financial capacity and business objectives of wind project developers,
   as well as the risk tolerances and objectives of equity and debt
   providers, each structure is, at its core, designed to manage project
   risk and to allocate federal tax incentives to those entities that can
   use them most efficiently. This paper surveys the six principal
   financing structures through which most new utility-scale wind projects
   (excluding utility-owned projects) in the USA have been financed from
   1999 to the present. These structures include simple balance sheet
   finance, several varieties of all-equity special allocation partnership
   `flip' structures and two leveraged structures. In addition to
   describing each structure's mechanics, the paper also discusses its
   rationale for use, the types of investors that find it appealing and
   why, and its relative frequency of use in the market. The paper
   concludes with a generalized summary of how a developer might choose one
   structure over another. Copyright (c) 2008 US Government Work.}},

   surrounding the Tonle Sap lake, Cambodia. We conducted the first
   comprehensive breeding season survey of Bengal Florican within the Tonle
   Sap region (19,500 km(2)). During 2005/06 and 2006/07 we systematically
   sampled 1-km squares for territorial males. Bengal Florican were
   detected within 90 1-km squares at a mean density of 0-34 males km(-2)
   which, accounting for unequal Survey effort across grassland blocks,
   provides a mean estimate of 0.2 males km(-2). Based on 2005 habitat
   extent, the estimated Tonle Sap population is 416 adult males (333-502
   +/- 95\% CI), more than half of them in Kompong Thorn province. Tonle
   Sap grasslands are rapidly being lost due to intensification of rice
   cultivation and, based on satellite images, we document declines of 28\%

   March 2007. Based on Mean 2005 population densities the remaining
   grassland may support as few as 294 adult male florican, a decline of
   30\% since 2005. In response to these habitat declines almost 350 km(2)
   of grassland have been designated as protected areas, set aside for

Abstract = {{Study Objective: To characterize the approach of academic chairs of
   anesthesiology in leading and managing their departments, and to gain
   insights into what they considered the most difficult challenges as
   chairs.
   Design: Internet-based survey instrument conducted during July and
   August of 2006.
   Setting: Academic medical center.
   Measurements: Department chairs of 132 academic anesthesiology programs
   who were listed on the Society of Academic Anesthesiology Chairs
   Listserv, were surveyed. The overall number of respondents were
   reported. However, as all questions were voluntary, not all were
   answered by each respondent. Observations are therefore reported as
   absolute numbers and percentages on a question-by-question basis.
   Respondents were asked to rank responses to some questions in order of
   importance (eg, 1 = most important). These data are presented as rank
   ordered median values, determined by the Kruskal-Wallis Test.
   Significant differences between groups were determined by Dunn's post
   test. A P-value < 0.05 was regarded as significant throughout.
   Main Results: The overall response rate was 55\%. Chairs spent 36\% of
   their time in leading, managing, and administration. They ranked
   Visionary and Coaching styles of leadership as most important.
   Seventy-nine percent had developed ``Vision{''} statements for the
   department and 64\% of respondents had set goals for divisions. To
   communicate within departments, 74\% of Chairs had at least monthly
   faculty meetings and 50\% held at least yearly faculty retreats. Chairs
   preferred communicating contentious issues face to face. Ninety-five
   percent of Chairs held at least yearly performance appraisals and 85\%
   had an established incentive system in the department. Academic
   productivity (73\%) and clinical time (68\%) were the most common
   components of the incentive system. In 65\% of departments, Chairs
   delegated the program directorship and in 73\%, the running of the
   National Residency Matching Program. The financial state of the
   department was shared at least annually in 93\% of departments. In most
   departments (77\%), faculty salary ranges were known but individual
   faculty salaries were not shared.
   Conclusions: Chairs considered the most important leadership challenge
   to be setting direction, for the department, and the most difficult
   management challenges as ``fostering research and scholarship{''} and
   ``maintaining revenue to support faculty{''}. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Objective: To integrate the resources from a local statewide managed
   care organization (MCO) and a supermarket pharmacy chain to conduct a
   comprehensive health risk appraisal (HRA). Collected data were used to
   assess cardiovascular risk factors and identify disease management

   Methods: An analysis to determine the prevalence of risk factors was
   conducted on a cross-sectional HRA survey. The HRA involved
   point-of-care cholesterol screening (with a follow-up risk factor
   questionnaire) conducted by pharmacist employees of the employer group
   (a regional supermarket chain). Those eligible for the screening were
   employees of the supermarket chain and their dependents covered by the
   participating MCO.
   Results: A total of 12,915 completed HRA questionnaires were received.
   The mean age of the employees participating was approximately 44 years.
   Of note, 14\%, 24\%, 21\%, and 69\% of questionnaires had abnormal
   values for total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
   cholesterol, blood pressure, and body mass index (BMI), respectively.
   Compared with national benchmarks, low HDL cholesterol and BMI more than
   30 kg/m(2) were more common in this cohort. More than one-fourth of the
   employees in this analysis were identified as being at high risk for a
   coronary heart disease event.
   Conclusion: The unique collaboration presented here allowed for an
   expanded role of pharmacists to implement a quality improvement program.
   In response, the employer decided to continue the HRA screening and
   offer a employee contribution reduction-based health incentive to
   covered members. The employer also is considering offering
   cardiovascular disease management interventions that will be performed

Journal = {{TRANSFUSION}},

Volume = {{49}},

Abstract = {{Health tests are often seen as promising donor incentives to improve the
   supply of blood. However, systematic behavioral evidence on donor
   recruitment is scarce.
   To study the effectiveness of a free cholesterol test in attracting new
   donors and motivating previous donors, two field experiments were
   conducted. In Study 1, 2825 nondonors were randomly assigned to one of
   three treatments: a solicitation letter, a solicitation letter plus an
   appeal, or a solicitation letter plus an appeal and the offer of a free
   cholesterol test. In Study 2, 8269 previous donors were randomly
   assigned to one of three treatments: a standard invitation, an
   invitation plus an appeal, or an invitation plus an appeal and a
   cholesterol test. Marginal effects from probit estimations were
   calculated to study the effects of the treatments on donors' response.
   In Study 1, only 0.6 percent reacted to the solicitation letter. There
   were no significant differences in the response rates between the three
   treatments. In Study 2, 45.3 percent of the invited previous donors came
   to donate. The appeal (marginal effect, -0.5\%; standard error {[}SE],
   1.9\%) and offering a cholesterol test (marginal effect, 1.6\%; SE,
   1.8\%) did not significantly increase the probability of a donation
   relative to the standard invitation. The treatment effects for the
   cholesterol test did not systematically differ between frequent and
   infrequent donors and female and male donors. There is some evidence
   that young donors responded relatively most positive to the cholesterol
   test (marginal effect, 4.4\%; SE, 2.2\%).
   Contrary to conclusions from survey studies, free cholesterol testing
   did not significantly increase donations from nondonors and previous
   donors during a 3-month campaign. The two studies show that field
   experiments are an important method to evaluate donation incentives,
   because measuring donors' intentions alone can lead to significantly
   different conclusions.}},

Abstract = {{Society's expectations of farmers in relation to their environmental
   performance are ever increasing, in general terms and in response to
   regional challenges. One tool for achieving environmental improvements
   in agriculture is the design and promotion of region-specific `best
   management practices' (BMPs). BMPs are conservation practices aimed at
   reducing diffuse source pollution from agricultural lands and thus
   improving end-of-catchment water quality, A suite of grazing BMPs was
   developed for the Burdekin River catchment in Australia, which drains
   into the Great Barrier Reef lagoon. BMPs were developed in a
   consultative fashion but without explicit consideration of key factors
   that influence adoption, in particular farmers' goals and risk
   perceptions. This paper utilises the data from a survey of 94 graziers
   in the Burdekin River catchment to explore whether and to what extent
   motivations and risk perceptions influence the adoption of BMPs. The
   results demonstrate clear correlations between both motivations, and
   risk attitudes, and the adoption of BMPs. In particular, strong
   conservation and lifestyle motivation translates into intrinsic
   motivation for adoption of conservation practices. while option values
   prevent strongly economically/financially motivated farmers from
   adopting in the absence of external incentives. We conclude that a sound
   understanding of farmers' motivations and risk attitudes is required-in
   a regional, industry and environmental context-to tailor public
   investments aimed at providing relevant improvements in the
   environmental performance of agriculture. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper outlines ways to maximize response rates to surveys by
   summarizing the most relevant literature to date and demonstrating how
   these techniques have resulted in consistently high rates of return in
   family practice research. We describe the methodology used in recent
   surveys of physicians conducted by the Centre for Studies in Family
   Medicine through its Thames Valley Family Practice Research Unit,
   located in London, Ontario, Canada and funded by the Ontario Ministry of
   Health and Long-Term Care. The identification and implementation of
   these techniques to maximize response rates is critical, as primary
   health care researchers often rely on information gathered through
   questionnaires to study physicians' practice profiles, experiences and
   attitudes. Four separate and distinct mailed surveys of physicians using
   a modified Dillman approach were conducted from 2001 to 2004. The
   sampling strategies, topics, types of questions and response formats of
   these surveys varied. The first survey did not use any incentives or
   recorded delivery/registered mail and received a response rate of 48\%.
   In sharp contrast, the other three surveys obtained responses rates of
   76\%, 74\%, 74\%, respectively, achieved through the use of gift
   certificates and recorded delivery/registered mail. Sending a survey by
   recorded delivery/registered mail tends to result in the survey package
   being given priority in the physicians' incoming mail at the practice.
   Gift certificates partially compensate physicians for time spent
   completing the survey and recognition of the time required is
   appreciated. The response rates achieved provide strong evidence to
   support the use of monetary incentives and recorded delivery/registered
   mail (along with the Dillman approach) in survey research. It is
   anticipated that this evidence will be used by other researchers to
   justify requests for funding to cover the costs associated with
   incentives and recorded delivery/registered mail. We recommend the use

Abstract = {{Given the increased reliance on caller id, caller blocking, and

   study tested the feasibility of using multi-step mailed Survey
   methodology to obtain a random sample of adult, substance-using couples.
   Feasibility was assessed in terms of response rates and generalizability
   of the sample. A sample of 1000 names and addresses was purchased from a
   professional survey company, Half of the sample received a \$1 incentive
   and the rest did not receive the incentive. There were no other
   differences between the other Procedures used. The response rate for the
   incentive group Was Significantly higher compared to the non-incentive
   group (66\% vs. 47\%, p < .001). Past month marijuana use was 4.6\%
   compared to estimates from the US National Survey on Drug Use and Health
   for this region of 5.0\%. Similarly, rates of heavy drinking and
   attitudes about drug use were also similar to other estimates. There
   were no differences on substance use for the incentive group compared to
   the non-incentive group. This Pilot Study demonstrated the feasibility

Abstract = {{A variety of preclinical models have been constructed to emphasize
   unique aspects of addiction-like behavior. These include Negative
   Reinforcement (Pain Avoidance), Positive Reinforcement (Pleasure
   Seeking), Incentive Salience (Craving), Stimulus Response Learning
   (Habits), and Inhibitory Control Dysfunction (Impulsivity). We used a
   survey to better understand why methamphetamine-dependent research
   volunteers (N = 73) continue to use methamphetamine, or relapse to
   methamphetamine use after a period of cessation of use. All participants
   met DSM-IV criteria for methamphetamine abuse or dependence, and did not
   meet criteria for other current Axis I psychiatric disorders or
   dependence on other drugs of abuse, other than nicotine. The
   questionnaire consisted of a series of face-valid questions regarding
   drug use, which in this case referred to methamphetamine use. Examples
   of questions include: Do you use drugs mostly to make bad feelings like
   boredom, loneliness, or apathy go away?, Do you use drugs mostly because
   you want to get high?, Do you use drugs mostly because of cravings?, Do
   you find yourself getting ready to take drugs without thinking about
   it?, and Do you impulsively take drugs?. The scale was anchored at 1
   (not at all) and 7 (very much). For each question, the numbers of
   participants rating each question negatively (1 or 2), neither
   negatively or affirmatively (3-5), and affirmatively (6 or 7) were
   tabulated. The greatest number of respondents (56\%) affirmed that they
   used drugs due to pleasure seeking. The next highest categories selected
   were impulsivity (27\%) and habits(25\%). Surprisingly, many
   participants reported that pain avoidance (30\%) and craving (30\%) were
   not important for their drug use. Results from this study support the
   contention that methamphetamine users (and probably other drug users as
   well) are more heterogeneous than is often appreciated, and imply that
   treatment development might be more successful if treatments targeted
   subtypes of patients, though a range of limitations to the approach used
   are acknowledged.}},

   FIELD STUDY}},
Journal = {{BULLETIN OF INDONESIAN ECONOMIC STUDIES}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{201-230}},
Abstract = {{Why do some local governments perform well, while others perform badly?
   The rapid shift from centralised-authoritarian to
   decentralised-democratic rule in Indonesia has been accompanied by a
   large variation in sub-national government policies across districts.
   Based on eight district case studies comprising 1,000 business surveys
   and 120 in-depth interviews, this paper argues that demand-side
   pressures from local firms, associations and district councils are less
   significant than supply-side pressures from local government leaders in
   explaining variations in taxation, licensing and corruption practices.
   In Indonesia's early transition to democratic decentralisation, societal
   pressures have been constrained by collective action problems and
   perverse political incentives. Local government leaders, on the other
   hand, have strong powers and new incentives for policy reform. In
   response to the good governance debate, this study's findings suggest
   that government leadership is an important, often under-estimated,
   policy determinant that can compensate for (or aggravate) weak societal
   checks in transitioning economies.}},

Title = {{Career stage and generational differences in psychological contracts}},
Journal = {{CAREER DEVELOPMENT INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{2-3}},
Pages = {{261-283}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to determine how employees in
   different generational groups (or cohorts) and different career stages
   perceive their psychological contracts.
   Design/methodology/approach - A survey of 345 working adults included
   psychological contract obligations, incentives and importance and the
   cognitive responses of job satisfaction, affective commitment and
   intention to leave. Super's ``Adult career concerns inventory{''}
   measured career stage.
   Findings - Small but significant differences between individuals'
   psychological contract perceptions were based on both career stage and
   generational cohort: higher levels of balanced obligations and
   fulfilment were found than either relational or transactional
   obligations and fulfilment; relational and transactional obligations
   were significantly higher for Baby Boomers than Generation Xers; a
   stronger negative relationship was found between transactional
   fulfilment and intention to leave for Generation Xers than Generation
   Yers; higher balanced fulfilment had a significantly stronger positive
   relationship with job satisfaction for exploration compared with other
   career stages and commitment for exploration compared with maintenance
   stages.
   Research limitations/implications - Cross-section methodology and
   difference scores in the female-dominated sample limits
   generalisability. The study's key theoretical contribution is the need
   to further investigate whether the protean career concept is operating
   within employees' perceptions of their psychological contractual terms.
   Originality/value - Despite widespread colloquial use of generational
   cohort groupings such as Baby Boomer, Generation X and Generation Y,
   small effect sizes were found. Implications for employers looking to
   manage employees' psychological contracts include that there are greater
   similarities than differences between the different career stages and
   generational cohorts.}},

Journal = {{EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH REVIEW}},

Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{26-40}},
Abstract = {{This meta-analysis examined 35 study results within last 10 years that
   directly compared the response rates of e-mail versus mail surveys.
   Individual studies reported inconsistent findings concerning the
   response rate difference between e-mail and mail surveys, but e-mail
   surveys generally have lower response rate (about 20\% lower on the
   average) than mail surveys. Two study features (population type and
   follow-up reminders) could account for some variation in the e-mail and
   mail survey response rate differences across the studies. For the
   studies involving college populations, the response rate difference
   between e-mail and mail surveys was much smaller, or even negligible,
   suggesting that e-mail survey is reasonably comparable with mail survey
   for college populations. The finding about follow-up reminder as a
   statistically significant study feature turns out to be somewhat an
   anomaly. Other study features (i.e., article type, random assignment of
   survey respondents into e-mail and mail survey modes, and use of
   incentives) did not prove to be statistically useful in accounting for
   the variation of response rate differences between mail and e-mail
   surveys. The findings here suggest that, in this age of internet
   technology, mail survey is still superior to e-mail survey in terms of
   obtaining higher response rate. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{176-188}},
Abstract = {{The cultivation of khat as a high value crop is rapidly expanding in the
   East Hararghe Zone of Ethiopia. Khat income currently supports the
   livelihood of millions and khat export generates a substantial foreign
   exchange earning. This article provides empirical evidence about the
   factors driving the process from the perspective of sustainable
   livelihood. The analysis is based on a set of data which was generated
   through qualitative fieldwork and a household survey. The analysis shows
   that the increasing shift by the farmers to khat production as a cash
   crop has primarily been triggered by market incentives. However, the
   shift reflects not only the price signal, but also that it is a response
   to context-specific factors such as demography, agro-climate and
   topography. The production of khat as a cash crop has positive income,
   food security and poverty effects at household level. Yet, khat is not a
   panacea; it is susceptible to frost damage, its market price varies
   widely over seasons across the year, and khat cultivation limits
   flexibility in resource use. Perhaps the most worrying is the status of
   the crop as a controlled substance in some countries against its
   dramatic expansion. The policy of hastily `criminalizing' khat
   production and trade can have dire consequences on the livelihood of the
   poor and the national economy. A long-term development strategy is
   required to encourage and support khat-dependent farm households and
   others to gradually reduce their reliance on khat through
   diversification into other farm and non-farm activities.}},

Title = {{Understanding the Water Crisis in Northern China: What the Government

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{141-158}},
Abstract = {{The overall aim of this paper is to attempt to discover the true facts
   in order to ascertain whether or not there is a water crisis in China,
   and if there is, to identify the responses of the different
   stakeholdersgovernment water officials, community leaders and farmers.
   In order to achieve this goal, several specific objectives are pursued.
   First, the paper evaluates the status of China's groundwater economy,
   examining whether or not the groundwater table is systematically
   falling. Second, in the parts of China that face a water crisis (or
   potential crisis), the paper documents the regulations and policies that
   the governmentboth local and regionalhave implemented and discusses
   whether they have been successfully implemented. Third, it describes how
   farmers have responded to the water crisis and tries to assess whether
   or not their roles have helped alleviate the water scarcities or
   exacerbated the crisis. To meet these objectives, two large field
   surveys are used that cover seven provinces in northern China. The
   findings demonstrate that, although the water table is not falling
   everywhere in northern China, there are still a substantial number of
   communities that appear to be facing a water crisis. When there is a
   water crisis, the data show that the government in China has begun to
   make a number of policy responses, but the implementation is not always
   effective. Where water is becoming scarce, farmers and community leaders
   have also responded in numerous ways. However, farmers do not
   necessarily respond in ways that effectively save water, mostly because
   they do not always have incentives to do so. With good incentives, the
   research shows that they do save water. Hence, the government cannot
   ignore the way that farmers respond. Indeed, good policy needs to use
   this responsiveness to reduce the adverse effects of water scarcities
   and encourage conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Object. The purpose of this study was to determine a reliable estimate
   of the size, demographic, and practice characteristics of the current
   pediatric neurosurgical workforce. The authors also sought to
   differentiate pediatric from nonpediatric neurosurgical practitioners
   and compare the demographic and practice characteristics of these 2
   groups. The term ``pediatric practitioner{''} will be used in this study
   to describe a practitioner whose practice is > 75\% pediatric patients
   in accordance with the American Board of Pediatric Neurological Surgery
   (ABPNS) requirements for board certification in pediatric neurosurgery.
   Those practitioners with < 75\% pediatric patients in their practice
   will be designated as ``nonpediatric practitioners.{''}
   Methods. The authors aggregated multiple databases of professional
   neurosurgical societies in an effort to identify pediatric neurosurgical
   practitioners. A 30-question survey was then administered to all
   identified practitioners, and responses were collected for 6 months.
   Primary analysis of pediatric versus nonpediatric practitioners was
   performed. Subgroup analyses of the characteristics of the pediatric
   practitioners were also performed to identify the effects of
   practitioner age, sex, and practice setting on survey responses.
   Results. A total of 342 practitioners received the survey, and 267
   responded (78.1\% response rate); 158 pediatric practitioners and 92
   nonpediatric practitioners were identified. Seventeen respondents were
   excluded from analysis. Pediatric practitioners were more likely to be
   women, ABPNS certified, have completed a pediatric fellowship, do fewer
   operative cases per year, have a more frequent call schedule, practice
   in a freestanding children's hospital, be in academic practice, and in
   need of recruiting additional faculty. Pediatric practitioners spent
   fewer hours per week in patient care, and were less likely to have a
   productivity-based salary or salary incentive based on relative value
   unit-production. Among pediatric practitioners, American Board of
   Neurological Surgery and ABPNS certification rates differed
   significantly among age groups, with older age groups being more likely
   to be certified by the American Board of Neurological Surgery and ABPNS.
   The rate of pediatric fellowship completion was significantly higher in
   the younger age groups. Anticipating retirement by age 65 was
   significantly more likely in the younger age groups, and hours spent per
   week spent in teaching and administrative ditties were lower in the
   younger age groups. There were 27 female and 131 male pediatric
   practitioners. The women were more likely to have completed a pediatric
   fellowship and performed fewer operative cases per year than the men.
   Nonacademic pediatric practitioners were more likely to have a relative
   value unit-based salary incentive, be reimbursed for call coverage, and
   spend more hours per week in patient care than academic pediatric
   practitioners. Academic pediatric practitioners spent more hours per
   week in clinical research.
   Conclusions. The authors estimate that there are fewer than 200
   pediatric neurosurgeons currently practicing in the United States.
   Current practice patterns unique to pediatrics may have important
   implications in recruiting and retaining the next generation of
   pediatric neurosurgeons. (DOI: 10.3171/2008.10.PEDS08255)}},

   Methods: Pre-validated questionnaire-based survey with stratified random

   responses with semi-quantitative measures of available alternatives.
   Results: The response rate was 83.1\%. The most important factor for
   pursuing university study was `prospect of finding an interesting
   challenging job' (rank 1-75\%). Family made a significant contribution
   in decision making. Given the chance, a majority (67.2\%) of respondents
   would prefer to study overseas. The main deterring factors were cost
   (67.7\%), distance from home (28\%), and local opportunity for
   post-graduation (23.4\%). Despite their inclination of study overseas,
   the majority (73.9\%) of the respondents indicated they were either very
   satisfied or satisfied with their current choice of university study.
   Only 20\% of students were comfortable in asking questions in classroom
   as asking questions was deemed `too risky' and `unnecessary to get
   better grades'. Students adopted strategies related to assessment and
   competition to monitor their study. Senior students reported university
   education as less relevant to their future careers as compared to junior
   students (p = 0.002).

Abstract = {{Background. Faculty development in medical education is gaining momentum

   colleges to understand the status of faculty development programmes and
   medical education units in medical colleges in India.
   Methods. Questionnaires were sent to principals of medical colleges by
   surface mail and to faculty through a web-based programme to elicit
   information on various aspects of faculty development programmes and
   medical education units. The responses of both groups were analysed.
   Results. The number of medical education units has increased rapidly
   after regulations have been revised in 1997 by the Medical Council of
   India. The main activities of medical-education units were to conduct
   workshops targeted at medical teachers. The frequently covered topics
   were teaching-learning, media and student assessment. Lectures dominated
   the methodology of imparting information. Evaluation was done mainly by
   feedback questionnaires and pre-test/post-test questionnaires. Projects
   and follow/up were rarely used. The responses from both groups were(
   strikingly similar. The major strengths of medical education units were
   perceived as availability of trained and motivated faculty, good
   infrastructure and supportive leadership. The shortcomings were lack of
   infrastructure, funding and full-time faculty, besides time constraints
   and resistance to change. The respondents suggested strengthening of
   infrastructure, appointment of full-time faculty and staff, incentives
   and recognition of contributions to faculty development, making
   participation a mandatory requirement, extending the scope of faculty
   development programmes to include research and networking at the
   national level.
   Conclusion. The study reveals the need for policy decisions that support
   functioning of medical education units in India besides active
   participation of the faculty. Natl Med J India 2009;22:28-32}},

Abstract = {{Aims: Increasing the percentage of rollover protective structure ( ROPS)
   equipped tractors has been the focus of many agricultural safety
   campaigns. Traditionally efforts have attempted to persuade farmers
   through education or community awareness interventions. These efforts
   have lead to marginal change. In response, a social marketing approach
   was tested as a means for increasing interest in ROPS retrofitting in
   New York. Methods: An initial phone survey was conducted with a random
   sample of New York farmers to identify a potential target population.
   Following target selection, in-depth interviews were conducted to
   isolate barriers and motivators to retrofitting. This information was
   used to develop message prototypes which were tested in small focus
   group discussions. Selected and revised messages, as well as various
   other incentives developed in response to feedback from interviews, were
   then tested in a prospective, quasi-randomized controlled trial.
   Results: Small crop and livestock farms were selected as the
   intervention target since they represent 86\% of New York farms with
   none or only one ROPS protected tractor. Barriers to retrofitting which
   were identified in interviews were: 1) constant exposures normalize
   risk, 2) risk is modeled by significant others and 3) safety in general
   and retrofitting in particular requires too much time and money. The
   piloting of ROPS incentives led to a marked increase in ROPS sales in
   New York. Conclusions: Social Marketing provides a promising framework
   for the design of agricultural injury prevention programs. The potential
   implications for other health initiatives seeking to promote behaviour
   change are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine how managed care affects physician financial
   incentives to reduce services to their patients, particularly how this
   relationship has evolved over time and whether the effects of capitated
   managed care and noricapitated managed care are different.
   Study Design: Retrospective study using Community Tracking Study
   physician survey data from 2000-2001 and 2004-2005.
   Methods: Physicians were included in the study sample only if they were
   surveyed in both 2000-2001 and 2004-2005 (balanced panel data). The
   study sample consisted of 4154 physicians, for a total of 8308
   observations in 2 periods. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used
   to analyze responses to questions regarding financial incentives,
   involvement with managed care as a share of practice revenues, and
   physician and practice characteristics.
   Results: Both capitated and noricapitated managed care significantly
   increased physician incentives to reduce care during 2000-2001, but
   neither had a statistically significant effect on financial incentives
   by 2004-2005. Capitated managed care rather than noricapitated managed
   care created the strongest incentives to reduce care; however, even
   these effects became rather weak during 2004-2005 compared with those in
   2000-2001.
   Conclusion: Managed care and traditional indemnity plans were
   substantially more similar in their effects on physician incentives to
   provide care by 2004-2005 than they were just 3 years earlier. This
   should alleviate policy concerns that managed care is providing
   physicians with the ``wrong{''} financial incentives to provide care.

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE To increase the overall 2007 response rate of the National
   Physician Survey (NPS) from the survey's 2004 rate of response with the
   implementation of various methodologic strategies.
   DESIGN Physicians were stratified to receive either a long version (12
   pages) or a short version (6 pages) of the survey (38\% and 62\%,
   respectively). Mixed modes of contact were used-58\% were contacted by
   e-mail and 42\% by regular mail-with multiple modes of contact attempted
   for nonrespondents. The self-administered, confidential surveys were
   distributed in either English or French. Medical residents and students
   received e-mail surveys only and were offered a substantial monetary
   lottery incentive for completing their surveys. A professional
   communications firm assisted in marketing the survey and delivered
   advance notification of its impending distribution.
   SETTING Canada.
   PARTICIPANTS A total of 62 441 practising physicians, 2627 second-year
   medical residents, and 9162 medical students in Canada.
   RESULTS Of the practising physicians group, 60 811 participants were
   eligible and 19 239 replied, for an overall 2007 study response rate of
   31.64\% (compared with 35.85\% in 2004). No difference in rate of
   response was found between the longer and shorter versions of the
   survey. If contacted by regular mail, the response rate was 34.1\%; the
   e-mail group had a response rate of 29.9\%. Medical student and resident
   response rates were 30.8\% and 27.9\%, respectively (compared with
   31.2\% and 35.6\% in 2004).
   CONCLUSION Despite shortening the questionnaires, contacting more
   physicians by e-mail, and enhancing marketing and follow-up, the 2007
   NPS response rate for practising physicians did not surpass the 2004 NPS
   response rate. Offering a monetary lottery incentive to medical
   residents and students was also unsuccessful in increasing their
   response rates. The role of surveys in gathering information from
   physicians and physicians-in-training remains problematic. Researchers
   need to investigate alternative strategies for achieving higher rates of
   response.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE To explore potential solutions to the challenge of gaining
   more respect for FPs from other specialists.
   DESIGN An original Web-based qualitative survey, from May 27, 2004, to
   January 5, 2005, involving 5 rounds.
   SETTING Province of Alberta.
   PARTICIPANTS A sample of 28 Alberta FPs of differing experience,
   locations, and types of practices.
   METHODS Purposeful maximum variation sampling was used to identify a
   heterogeneous sample of FPs. The Delphi technique was used with an
   anonymous, iterative, Web-based survey to develop consensus among
   participating FPs. The first 2 rounds of the survey were designed to
   generate rich, thick descriptions of the rewards and challenges FPs
   experienced; the last 3 rounds were designed to refine this information
   and identify potential solutions and support that key organizations
   could provide. This information was collapsed into themes using thematic
   content analysis and reviewed by a working group; with input from the
   working group we decided to focus our analysis on the challenge of
   gaining respect from specialists.
   MAIN FINDINGS Each round yielded an 86\% to 96\% response rate, from
   which 11 key challenges were identified including ``respect from
   specialists.{''} Suggestions of potential solutions to gaining more
   respect included the need to create and develop relationships between
   FPs and other specialists and to support each other's roles; to raise
   the profile of family medicine in universities and teaching hospitals;
   to change negative attitudes by promoting the expertise and role of
   family medicine to others; to demonstrate and maintain a comprehensive
   skill set; and to address intraprofessional inequities and provide
   appropriate incentives. Participants suggested roles that organizations
   could play; for example, universities and medical schools could avoid
   making negative comments about family practice, reward FPs involved in
   teaching, and decentralize medical education to provide more experience
   in community settings and environments that model interactions between
   specialists and FPs. Organizations could recognize and promote the role
   that FPs play in the health care system, seek their input into decisions
   involving primary care, and move toward equitable and fair remuneration.
   CONCLUSION Perceived lack of respect toward FPs from some of their
   specialist colleagues might be reflective of issues that go beyond
   family physician-specialist interaction. Solutions will likely require
   the involvement of academic centres and other organizations.}},

Abstract = {{Reproductive management has received increased attention in recent years
   as new technologies and programs have been developed to aid dairy
   managers in efficiently breeding cows and heifers. Efficient breeding of
   cows and heifers has become increasingly difficult as fertility has
   decreased because of a correlated negative response with milk yield.
   Dairy farm survey results were used to parameterize the economic
   analyses of reproductive management programs. Reproductive management
   program costs and the levels of reproductive performance achieved with
   such programs varied significantly among farms and were especially
   sensitive to on-farm labor costs. For example, visual heat detection
   requires more hours of labor per cow than use of an estrus
   synchronization program. Therefore, visual heat detection programs were
   relatively more sensitive to labor costs than synchronization programs.
   In addition, past reproductive performance was found to affect the
   determination of which reproductive program was optimal. Farms that had
   attained high levels of labor efficiency for visual heat detection in
   the past had less incentive to adopt a synchronization program than
   farms with less efficient visual heat detection.}},

Abstract = {{Tropical countries face special specific problems in implementing
   sustainable forest management (SFM). In many countries, questions are
   raised on whether tropical forests should be publicly, commonly or
   privately owned and managed in order to enhance sustainability. Other
   debates also focus on whether small-scale enterprises are better
   positioned than large-scale industrial concessions to reduce poverty and
   attain sustainable management. In countries where large tracts of forest
   are state-owned, concessions are viewed as a means of delivering
   services of public and collective interest through an association of
   private investment and public regulation. However, the success of an
   industrial concession model in countries with large forest resource
   endowment to achieve multiple goals such as sustainable forest
   management and local/regional development depends on two critical
   assumptions. First, forest functions and services should be managed and
   maintained as public goods. In many cases, additional uses - and
   corresponding rights - can take place alongside logging activities.
   Industrial concessions can be more efficient than other tenure models
   (such as community-based forest management and small-scale enterprises)
   in achieving SFM, add value to raw material and comply with growing
   environmental norms. This is especially the case in market-remote areas
   with low population density and poor infrastructure. Secondly, to
   achieve these different outcomes, any concession system needs to be
   monitored and regulated, especially in contexts dominated by
   asymmetrical information between regulating authorities and
   concessionaires. New institutional responses have recently been put
   forward in several countries, providing valuable materials to design a
   renewed policy mix which associates public and private incentives. This
   paper provides a survey of the experience of forest concessions in
   several Central African and South American countries. The concession
   system is examined in order to clarify the issues involved, the problems
   encountered, and what can be learned from the shared experience of these
   countries in the last decade. This paper argues that despite a sometimes
   patchy record, concessions can help promote SFM so long as they are
   packaged with a certain number of specific measures. (C) 2008 Elsevier

   Design: Cross-sectional mailed survey conducted May through July 2006.
   Setting: North Carolina.
   Participants: 910 physicians, 55 years of age or older, whose primary
   specialty involved direct, nonsurgical care of adults.
   Measurements: Current volunteerism and future interest in selected
   activities.
   Results: Of the respondents, 89.8\% were male and 87.4\% were white;
   57.4\% worked full-time, 21.7\% worked part-time, and 21.0\% were
   retired. Of current retirees, 37.1\% expressed interest in volunteering.
   Areas of greatest interest were medical teaching, working in free

   staying mentally active (67.3\%) or involved in medicine (61.2\%) and
   contributing to society (60.5\%). Substantial barriers included concerns
   about malpractice (61.5\%) and paperwork or bureaucracy (46.0\%). The
   majority of respondents (66.7\%) felt that lack of payment would not
   influence volunteering.
   Limitations: The 59\% overall response rate and exclusion of unlicensed
   retired physicians limit study generalizability. The data were provided

Abstract = {{Our data collection procedure for young adult (YA) follow-up surveys
   precedes the survey with a request to the parent for locator information
   on the YA. We tested how providing a token prepaid cash incentive to
   their parents would affect both parent response and subsequent (i.e.,
   ``downstream{''}) survey response from the YAs. Parents were randomly
   assigned to one of three incentive conditions: \$0 (N = 97), \$1 (N =
   98), and \$2 (N = 97). We found strong evidence for a parent incentive
   effect on parent response during the parent mail/phone sequence, and
   mild evidence at the end of the parent effort. We found no parent
   incentive effect on final YA survey response. We did, however, find an
   effect on early YA survey response. For example, at 30 days following
   the initial survey mailing, YA survey response was 46.4 percent, 61.2
   percent, and 58.8 percent for those whose parents received \$0, \$1, and
   \$2, respectively (p = .03). Also, we found that giving \$1 or \$2 to
   parents increased the speed of YA survey response by 34 percent (p =
   .02). We found no evidence for a differential parent incentive effect on
   the speed of survey response between female and male YAs. The increase
   in the YA survey response speed imparted by a \$1 or \$2 incentive to
   parents can more than pay for itself by substantially reducing the
   proportion of YAs requiring intensive follow-up efforts.}},

   Design: A qualitative study using triangulation of data from one postal
   questionnaire, one hand-delivered questionnaire with semistructured
   interview and focus group discussions. Data from a small community
   survey from 13 rural districts also included.
   Participants: Sixty-two Nepali GPs, 25 doctors in General Practice
   training programs, 11 individuals involved in policy development and
   rural health care.
   Results: The key issues identified by this study as critical to the
   retention of Nepali GPs in rural areas were:
   Career/promotion prospects
   Status/recognition
   Financial incentives
   Working conditions
   Education for children
   Continuing medical education
   Political stability and security
   Conclusions: The strongest theme was that of career development. This
   must be addressed by the Government of Nepal if there is to be any hope
   of improving retention of GPs in rural areas. GPs need to have a clear
   career ladder, with recognition of the value of service in rural areas.
   There is, however, no one single answer to the complex interacting
   factors that impact on GP retention in rural Nepal. A multifaceted,
   holistic response is necessary. From the level of community awareness, a

Abstract = {{Objective. To identify predictors of changes in staff morale and burnout
   associated with participation in a quality improvement (QI) initiative
   at community health centers (HCs).
   Data Sources. Surveys of staff at 145 HCs participating in the Health
   Disparities Collaboratives (HDC) program in 2004.
   Data Collection and Study Design. Self-administered questionnaire data
   collected from 622 HC staff (68 percent response rate) were analyzed to
   identify predictors of reported change in staff morale and burnout.
   Predictive categories included outcomes of the QI initiative, levels of
   HDC integration, institutional support, the use of incentives, and
   demographic characteristics of respondents and centers.
   Principal Findings. Perceived improvements in staff morale and reduced
   likelihood of staff burnout were associated with receiving personal
   recognition, career promotion, and skill development opportunities.
   Similar outcomes were associated with sufficient funding and personnel,
   fair distribution of work, effective training of new hires, and
   consistent provider participation.
   Conclusions. Having sufficient personnel available to administer the HDC
   was found to be the strongest predictor of team member satisfaction.
   However, a number of low-cost, reasonably modifiable, organizational and
   leadership characteristics were also identified, which may facilitate
   improvements in staff morale and reduce the likelihood of staff burnout
   at HCs participating in the HDC.}},

   in these studies, which covered more than 100,000 organizations and
   400,000 individual respondents. The average response rate for studies
   that utilized data collected from individuals was 52.7 percent with a

   relative stability in response rates in the past decade and higher
   response rates for journals published in the USA. The use of incentives
   was not found to be related to response rates and, for studies of
   organizations, the use of reminders was associated with lower response

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SCHOOL HEALTH}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{78}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{445-451}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Children's health is an important indicator of community
   health because children are especially vulnerable to disease. The school
   setting is ideal for assessing these vulnerabilities and prevalence of
   disease, yet the methods that produce high participation among students
   and their families are not usually described or evaluated. This is
   important because high participation rates increase reliability of data
   and interpretation of results.
   METHODS: In order to determine which methods produce the highest
   response rates in a parent-report school-based survey, a child-focused
   protocol, consisting of a brief classroom presentation and incentives
   for participation, was compared to a parent/teacher outreach method and
   a teacher-only outreach protocol. Methods were implemented in schools
   matched on student demographics and neighborhood socioeconomic level.
   The child-focused method was found to yield the highest response rate;
   thus, it was deployed in 26 schools to determine its effectiveness in
   schools of varying socioeconomic levels.
   RESULTS: Response rates were highest using the child-focused protocol
   when compared to those resulting from the parent/teacher outreach or the
   teacher-only protocols (80.5\% vs 74.7\%, 83.4\% vs 45.8\%,
   respectively). After full deployment, the response rate of the
   child-focused protocol was 76.9\% (70.8-82.8\%), with 46.9\% of
   classrooms achieving a response rate of 80\% or greater. The sample
   obtained was highly representative in racial/ethnic distribution, as
   evidenced by its strong correlation with the individual school
   enrollment, the 5- to 12-year-old population of surrounding ZIP codes,
   and the New York City public school population.
   CONCLUSION: Participatory research methods that engage schoolchildren
   and school staff directly in the research process yield the highest
   response rates for school-based studies and provide educational benefits
   for the school community.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Recent experiences of survey researchers suggest that

   Research Design: Randomized controlled trial. Subjects: Five hundred
   seventy-eight physicians caring for patients with lung or colorectal
   cancer in northern California. Measures: Proportion of physicians
   responding to the survey.
   Results: Overall, 60.0\% of physicians responded to the survey. The
   response rate was 52.1\% for physicians who received a \$20 check versus
   67.8\% for physicians who received a \$50 check (P < 0.001). Similar
   differences in response rates were seen in strata by physician sex, year

   Study Design: Cross-sectional observational study.
   Methods: Physician self-reported financial arrangements from a survey of
   348 medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and surgeons caring for
   patients with breast cancer in Los Angeles County (response rate, 76\%).
   Physicians were asked whether they were subject to financial incentives
   for quality (ie, patient satisfaction surveys and adherence to practice
   guidelines). We examined the prevalence and correlates of incentives and
   performed multivariate logistic regression analyses to assess predictors
   of incentives, controlling for other covariates.
   Results: Twenty percent of respondents reported incentives based on
   patient satisfaction, and 15\% reported incentives based on guideline
   adherence. The use of incentives for quality in this cohort of
   oncologists and surgeons was modest and was primarily associated with
   staff- or group-model health maintenance organization (HMO) settings. In
   other settings, important predictors were partial physician ownership

   Conclusions: Most cancer care providers in Los Angeles County outside of
   staff- or group-model HMOs are not subject to explicit financial
   incentives based on quality-of-care measures. Those who are, seem more
   likely to be associated with large practice settings. New approaches are
   needed to direct financial incentives for quality toward specialists
   outside of staff- or group-model HMOs if pay-for-performance programs

Abstract = {{The recently-described Arunachal macaque Macaca munzala is so far known

   the first conservation status assessment for the species. Our surveys
   enumerated a total of 569 individuals in the Tawang and West Kameng
   districts of the State. The species seems to be tolerant of
   anthropogenic habitat change but is vulnerable to hunting. A low infant
   to adult female ratio suggests that not all adult females reproduce at
   any given time, and females do not give birth every year. The macaques
   are persecuted largely in response to crop damage, with the practice of
   keeping them as pets providing an added incentive to hunting. The
   species is, however, able to attain remarkably high densities in the
   absence of hunting. Crop damage by the macaque is widespread; patterns
   of crop damage are similar across altitudinal zones and do not seem to
   be correlated with macaque density. The species will need to be
   protected in human-modified landscapes, and the issues of crop damage

Abstract = {{Purpose: Limited previous data suggest that heterogeneity exists in the
   treatment approaches for women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). We
   sought in a longitudinal cohort study of women with DCIS to assess the
   attitudes and management approaches toward DICIS among physicians who
   provide care to women. Materials and Methods: Eligible physicians were
   invited to participate In a 1-time mailed survey. A financial incentive
   and reminders were used to enhance the response rate. Physician
   perception of risks associated with DCIS for patients and management
   approaches were evaluated. Results: Two hundred and eight physicians
   were identified, and 151 (73\%) completed the survey. Respondents had a
   median age of 49 years (range, 32-75 years), and most were surgeons or
   medical oncologists (66\%). Eighty-eight percent reported seeing an
   average of >= 1 new patient with DCIS per month. In a multivariable
   model, physicians who cared for proportionately fewer patients with
   breast cancer were more likely to view DICIS as a riskier disease to a
   patient's overall health compared with physicians who cared for more
   women with breast cancer (odds ratio, 2.2; 95\% CI, 1.1-4.6; P = .036).
   Physicians exhibited differences in management approaches when

   terms when speaking with patients with DCIS. Conclusion: Substantial
   variation exists among physicians regarding perceptions and management
   approaches for women with DCIS. In some settings, risks of
   physician-recommended therapy might outweigh benefits. Further
   evaluation of the effects of physician management approaches and
   attitudes about DCIS on patient outcomes is warranted.}},

Title = {{The effect of a three-tier formulary on antidepressant utilization and
   expenditures}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH POLICY AND ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{67-77}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background: Health plans in the United States are struggling to contain
   rapid growth in their spending on medications. They have responded by
   implementing multi-tiered formularies, which label certain brand
   medications `non-preferred' and require higher patient copayments for
   those medications. This multi-tier policy relies on patients'
   willingness to switch medications in response to copayment
   differentials. The antidepressant class has certain characteristics that
   may pose problems for implementation of three-tier formularies, such as
   differences in which medication works for which patient, and high rates
   of medication discontinuation.
   Aims of the Study: To measure the effect of a three-tier formulary on
   antidepressant utilization and spending, including decomposing spending
   allocations between patient and plan.
   Methods: We use claims and eligibility files for a large, mature
   nonprofit managed care organization that started introducing its
   three-tier formulary on January 1, 2000, with a staggered implementation
   across employer groups. The sample includes 109,686 individuals who were
   continuously enrolled members during the study period. We use a
   pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design that includes a comparison
   group, comprising members whose employer had not adopted three-tier as
   of March 1, 2000. This permits some control for potentially confounding
   changes that could have coincided with three-tier implementation.
   Results: For the antidepressants that became nonpreferred, prescriptions
   per enrollee decreased 11\% in the three-tier group and increased 5\% in
   the comparison group. The own-copay elasticity of demand for
   nonpreferred drugs can be approximated as -0.11.
   Difference-in-differences regression finds that the three-tier formulary
   slowed the growth in the probability of using antidepressants in the
   post-period, which was 0.3 percentage points lower than it would have
   been without three-tier. The three-tier formulary also increased
   out-of-pocket payments while reducing plan payments and total spending.
   Discussion: The results indicate that the plan enrollees were somewhat
   responsive to the changed incentives, shifting away from the drugs that
   became nonpreferred. However, the intervention also resulted in
   cost-shifting from plan to enrollees, indicating some
   price-inelasticity. The reduction in the proportion of enrollees filling
   any prescriptions contrasts with results of prior studies for
   non-psychotropic drug classes. Limitations include the possibility of
   confounding changes coinciding with three-tier implementation (if they
   affected the two groups difterentially); restriction to continuous
   enrollees; and lack of data on rebates the plan paid to drug
   manufacturers.
   Implications for Health Care Provision and Use: The results of this
   study suggest that the impact of the three-tier formulary approach may
   be somewhat different for antidepressants than for some other classes.
   Implications for Health Policy: Policymakers should monitor the effects
   of three-tier programs on utilization in psychotropic medication
   classes.
   Implications for Further Research: Future studies should seek to
   understand the reasons for patients' limited response to the change in
   incentives, perhaps using physician and/or patient surveys. Studies
   should also examine the effects of three-tier programs on patient
   adherence, quality of care, and clinical and economic outcomes.}},

Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{105-117}},

Abstract = {{Respondent incentives are increasingly used as a measure of combating
   falling response rates and resulting risks of nonresponse bias.
   Nonresponse in panel surveys is particularly problematic, since even low
   wave-on-wave nonresponse rates can lead to substantial cumulative
   losses; if nonresponse is differential, this may lead to increasing bias
   across waves. Although the effects of incentives have been studied
   extensively in cross-sectional contexts, little is known about
   cumulative effects across waves of a panel. We provide new evidence
   about the effects of continued incentive payments on attrition, bias and
   item nonresponse, using data from a large scale, multi-wave, mixed mode
   incentive experiment on a UK government panel survey of young people. In
   this study, incentives significantly reduced attrition, far outweighing
   negative effects on item response rates in terms of the amount of
   information collected by the survey per issued case. Incentives had
   proportionate effects on retention rates across a range of respondent
   characteristics and as a result did not reduce attrition bias in terms
   of those characteristics. The effects of incentives on retention rates
   were larger for unconditional than conditional incentives and larger in
   postal than telephone mode. Across waves, the effects on attrition
   decreased somewhat, although the effects on item nonresponse and the
   lack of effect on bias remained constant. The effects of incentives at
   later waves appeared to be independent of incentive treatments and mode
   of data collection at earlier waves.}},

Abstract = {{Background: With the growing use of Internet-based interventions,
   strategies are needed to encourage broader participation. This study
   examined the effects of combinations of monetary incentives and mailing
   characteristics on enrollment, retention, and cost effectiveness for an
   online health program.
   Methods: In 2004, a recruitment letter was mailed to randomly selected
   Midwestern integrated health system members aged 21-65 and stratified by
   gender and race/ethnicity; recipients were randomly pre-assigned to one
   of 24 combinations of incentives and various mailing characteristics.
   Enrollment and 3-month retention rates were measured by completion of
   online surveys. Analysis, completed in 2005, compared enrollment and
   retention factors using t tests and chi-square tests. Multivariate
   logistic regression modeling assessed the probability of enrollment and
   retention.
   Results: Of 12,289 subjects, 531 (4.3\%) enrolled online, ranging from
   1\% to 11\% by incentive combination. Highest enrollment occurred with
   unconditional incentives, and responses varied by gender. Retention
   rates ranged from 0\% to 100\%, with highest retention linked to
   higher-value incentives. The combination of a \$2 bill prepaid incentive
   and the promise of \$20 for retention (10\% enrollment and 71\%
   retention) was optimal, considering per-subject recruitment costs (\$32
   enrollment, \$70 retention) and equivalent enrollment by gender and
   race/ethnicity.
   Conclusions: Cash incentives improved enrollment in an online health
   program. Men and women responded differently to mailing characteristics
   and incentives. Including a small prepaid monetary incentive (\$2 or
   \$5) and revealing the higher promised-retention incentive was cost
   effective and boosted enrollment.}},

   (English or Spanish) and region (California, Florida, New York/New
   Jersey, and other states). Ordinary least squares regression is used to
   model the effect of Hispanic primary language and region on CAHPS
   scales, controlling for age, gender, education, and self-rated health.
   Data Collection/Extraction Methods. The analytic sample consists of
   125,369 respondents (82 percent response rate) enrolled in 181 Medicare
   managed care plans across the U.S. Of the 125,369 respondents, 8,463 (7
   percent) were self-identified as Hispanic. The survey was made available
   in English and Spanish, and 1,353 Hispanics completed one in Spanish.
   Primary Finding. Hispanic English speakers had less favorable reports of
   care than whites for all dimensions of care except provider
   communication. Hispanic Spanish speakers reported more negative
   experiences than whites with timeliness of care, provider communication,
   and office staff helpfulness, but better reports of care for getting
   needed care. Spanish speakers in all regions except Florida had less
   favorable scores than English-speaking Hispanics for provider
   communication and office staff helpfulness, but more positive
   assessments for getting needed care. There were greater regional
   variations in CAHPS scores among Hispanic Spanish speakers than among
   Hispanic English speakers. Spanish speakers in Florida had more positive
   experiences than Spanish speakers in other regions for most dimensions
   of care.
   Conclusions. Hispanics in Medicare managed care face barriers to care;
   however, their experiences with care vary by language and region.
   Spanish speakers (except FL) have less favorable experiences with
   provider communication and office staff helpfulness than their
   English-speaking counterparts, suggesting language barriers in the
   clinical encounter. On the other hand, Spanish speakers reported more
   favorable experiences than their English-speaking counterparts with the
   managed care aspects of their care (getting needed care and plan
   customer service). Medicare managed care plans need to address the
   observed disparities in patient experiences among Hispanics as part of
   their quality improvement efforts. Plans can work with their network
   providers to address issues related to timeliness of care and office
   staff helpfulness. In addition, plans can provide incentives for
   language services, which have the potential to improve communication
   with providers and staff among Spanish speakers. Finally, health plans
   can reduce the access barriers faced by Hispanics, especially among
   English speakers.}},

Abstract = {{Nationwide, private land conservation (PLC) is on the rise. Land trusts,
   local government open space and natural area programs, and revised land
   use codes, as well as federal and state tax laws, combine to offer an
   increasing number of incentives and opportunities for landowners to
   consider. Such programs mitigate the loss of agricultural lands,
   wildlife habitat, and open space occurring as a result of development
   pressure. Larimer County, Colorado, has considerable development
   pressure and a diversity of voluntary and quasi-regulatory programs that
   stimulate PLC. This study probes the motivations, characteristics, and
   management practices of the landowners involved, and how these differ
   according to the mechanisms chosen to conserve private land. We surveyed
   all County landowners (grantors) who conserved private land using
   conservation easements, covenants, and cluster developments and
   interviewed a subset of those landowners. The typical grantor is older,
   married, well-educated, and likely retired. Five motivational domains
   were derived from responses to survey items. The natural resource
   protection domain was assigned the highest importance by participating
   landowners followed by community-mindedness, family commitments,
   financial incentives, and sustaining agricultural production.
   Motivations also differ significantly according to the type of
   conservation program utilized, geographic location, and the amount of
   land owned. Half of the respondents were found to be quite to fully
   engaged in management and monitoring activities. These and other
   findings may be useful to local governments and other entities engaged
   in private land conservation wishing to optimize available resources,
   the approaches, and practices used with different landowners.}},

Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{223-246}},

Abstract = {{An important feature of a Contingent Value (CV) study is that
   researchers design a survey that guides respondents to answer
   dichotomous choice (DC) questions as if they represent once-and-for-all
   choices. Researchers frequently construct hypothetical markets to
   satisfy this condition; yet detractors assert that `hypotheticality'
   leads inevitably to inflated DC responses. For active policy questions,
   however, some respondents may suspect that a CV informs an actual policy
   issue; so to reject a DC might induce the policy-maker to reintroduce
   the policy with a price reduction or a program improvement. With
   potential incentives to deflate a DC response when policies are active,
   we locate two types of respondents that represent two different
   incentives. One class is expected to be able to risk permanent rejection
   of a waiver from one automobile emissions inspection. This class more
   frequently rejects a DC value known to improve existing conditions.
   Another respondent class is expected to be risk averse to defeat of the
   program or to excessive delay. Predictably, these respondents more
   frequently accept a DC value that represents a known gain. Conservative
   DC responses have implications for the use of CV in active policy
   contexts, opening a role for theory to assist practitioners in these
   circumstances.}},

Abstract = {{Background. One of the most fiercely debated strategies to increase the
   number of kidneys for transplantation is the introduction of financial
   incentives. As the success of such strategy largely depends on public
   support, we performed a public survey on this topic.
   Methods. We developed a questionnaire on financial incentives for living
   kidney donation. We investigated the public opinion on two different
   fixed compensations: either life-long health insurance compensation or
   e25 000. Furthermore, we investigated public preferences on the
   practical implementation: either the patient seeks a donor or the donor
   registers for donation at an independent institute. For all examples,
   health insurance companies would cover costs of treatment. TNS NIPO, a
   professional organization for market research, sent the survey to a
   response panel that is made representative for the general population.
   Results. Five hundred fifty respondents (M/F: 60/40; median age: 46)
   filled out the questionnaire. Forty-six percent considered the situation
   wherein health insurance companies would introduce financial incentives
   to increase the number of living kidney donors undesirable (26\%
   undesirable; 20\% very undesirable), compared to 25\% who perceived this
   as desirable (20\% desirable; 5\% very desirable). The option wherein
   the donor registers at an independent institute to donate to a patient
   on the list and in turn receives life-long health insurance compensation
   was chosen as most favourable. Of all respondents, 5.5\% stated that
   there was a (very) great chance that they would donate a kidney in order
   to get compensation if such system were to be reality.
   Conclusion. Although almost half of the respondents (46\%) were
   reluctant towards introducing a system with fixed compensation to
   increase the number of living kidney donors, still 25\% of the general
   public reacted positively.}},

Abstract = {{In random digit dial (RDD) telephone surveys, some proportion of the

Title = {{The General Practice Assessment Questionnaire (GPAQ) - Development and
   psychometric characteristics}},
Journal = {{BMC FAMILY PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{FEB 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Continual quality improvement in primary care is an
   international priority. In the United Kingdom, the major initiative for
   improving quality of care is the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QoF) of
   the 2004 GP contract. Although the primary focus of the QoF is on
   clinical care, it is acknowledged that a comprehensive assessment of
   quality also requires valid and reliable measurement of the patient
   perspective, so financial incentives are included in the contract for
   general practices to survey patients' views. One questionnaire specified
   for use in the QoF is the General Practice Assessment Questionnaire
   (GPAQ). This paper describes the development of the GPAQ (with
   post-consultation and postal versions) and presents a preliminary
   examination of the psychometric properties of the questionnaire.
   Methods: Description of scale development and preliminary analysis of
   psychometric characteristics (internal reliability, factor structure),
   based on a large dataset of routinely collected GPAQ surveys (n =
   190,038 responses to the consultation version of GPAQ and 20,309
   responses to the postal version) from practices in the United Kingdom
   during the 2005-6 contract year.
   Results: Respondents tend to report generally favourable ratings.
   Responses were particularly skewed on the GP communication scale, though
   no more so than for other questionnaires in current use in the UK for
   which data were available. Factor analysis identified 2 factors that
   clearly relate to core concepts in primary care quality ('access' and
   `interpersonal care') that were common to both version of the GPAQ. The
   other factors related to `enablement' in the post-consultation version
   and `nursing care' in the postal version.
   Conclusion: This preliminary evaluation indicates that the scales of the
   GPAQ are internally reliable and that the items demonstrate an
   interpretable factor structure. Issues concerning the distributions of
   GPAQ responses are discussed. Potential further developments of the item
   content for the GPAQ are also outlined.}},

Volume = {{106}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Safety climate is often measured via surveys to identify
   appropriate patient safety interventions. The introduction of an
   insurance premium incentive for simulation-based anesthesia crisis
   resource management (CRM) training motivated our naturalistic experiment
   to compare the safety climates of several departments and to assess the
   impact of the training.
   METHODS: We administered a 59-item survey to anesthesia providers in six
   academic anesthesia programs (Phase 1). Faculty in four of the programs
   subsequently participated in a CRM program using simulation. The survey
   was readministered 3 yr later (Phase 2). Factor analysis was used to
   create scales regarding common safety themes. Positive safety climate
   (\% of respondents with positive safety attitudes) was computed for the
   scales to indicate the safety climate levels.
   RESULTS: The usable response rate was 44\% (309/708) and 38\% (293/772)
   in Phases 1 and 2 respectively. There was wide variation in response
   rates among hospitals and providers. Eight scales were identified. There
   were significantly different climate scores among hospitals but no
   difference between the trained and untrained cohorts. The positive
   safety climate scores varied from 6\% to 94\% on specific survey
   questions. Faculty and residents had significantly different perceptions
   of the degree to which residents are debriefed about their difficult
   clinical situations.
   CONCLUSIONS: Safety climate indicators can. vary substantially among
   anesthesia practice groups. Scale scores and responses to specific
   questions can suggest practices for improvement. Overall safety climate
   is probably not a good criterion for assessing the impact of
   simulation-based CRM training. Training alone was insufficient to alter
   engrained behaviors in the absence of further reinforcing actions.}},

Abstract = {{Evidence shows that minority patients are underrepresented in clinical
   trials. The development of new drugs and treatments, however, requires
   that clinical research studies include representative participants,
   particularly in light of evidence indicating that minority populations
   sometimes respond differently to prescription medications. Racial
   disparities among clinical investigators are often cited as a major
   reason why minority patients are underrepresented in clinical trials.
   However, there is little to no empirical data to support or refute the
   prevalence of disparities among clinical investigators. The Tufts Center
   conducted two online surveys of 1376 physicians. The first survey (N =
   859 respondents; 31\% response rate) assessed the overall incidence of
   minority physician involvement in clinical research. The second survey (
   N = 768 respondents; 20\% response rate) assessed the demographics,
   experience, and infrastructure of minority physicians who have
   participated in clinical research as a principal investigator or
   subinvestigator. The results of this study indicate that significant
   racial disparities exist among clinical investigators. The results also
   support assertions that physician race influences race of the clinical
   trial volunteer. The incidence of participation in clinical research
   among minority physicians is well below that observed among white
   physicians, more so with regard to U. S. Food \& Drug
   Administration-regulated clinical trials funded by industry. Minority
   investigators tend to conduct and initiate fewer clinical trials
   annually. Yet minority and white physician interest in participating in
   clinical research is similarly high. Minority investigators tend be
   younger, with more limited clinical research infrastructure and support
   than their white counterparts. New strategies, policies, incentives, and
   reforms are needed to address racial disparities among clinical
   investigators. In addition, disparities among both volunteers and
   investigators need to be tracked more closely and methodically to
   monitor and assess the impact of newly implemented programs and reforms.}},

   Surveys (with free text response sections) of MMT secondary care staff,

   pharmacies was undertaken in Auckland, New Zealand, followed by a 10\%
   random sample non-responder-follow-up. Results. A response rate of
   39.1\% to the postal survey was obtained. In general, knowledge of

   Respondents were generally well motivated towards undertaking this role,

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MARKET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{79-104}},
Abstract = {{One question that arises when discussing the usefulness of web-based
   surveys is whether they gain the same response rates compared to other
   modes of collecting survey data. A common perception exists that, in
   general, web survey response rates are considerably lower. However, such
   unsystematic anecdotal evidence could be misleading and does not provide
   any useful quantitative estimate. Meta-analytic procedures synthesising
   controlled experimental mode comparisons could give accurate answers
   but, to the best of the authors' knowledge, such research syntheses have
   so far not been conducted.
   To overcome this gap, the authors have conducted a meta-analysis of 45
   published and unpublished experimental comparisons between web and other
   survey modes. On average, web surveys yield an 11\% lower response rate
   compared to other modes (the 95\% confidence interval is confined by
   15\% and 6\% to the disadvantage of the web mode).
   This response rate difference to the disadvantage of the web mode is
   systematically influenced by the sample recruitment base (a smaller
   difference for panel members as compared to one-time respondents), the
   solicitation mode chosen for web surveys (a greater difference for
   postal mail solicitation compared to email) and the number of contacts
   (the more contacts, the larger the difference in response rates between
   modes). No significant influence on response rate differences can be
   revealed for the type of mode web surveys are compared to, the type of
   target population, the type of sponsorship, whether or not incentives
   were offered, and the year the studies were conducted. Practical
   implications are discussed.}},

Pages = {{264-283}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a snapshot of
   environmental management practices in the UK and discuss managerial
   responses to environmental issues in comparison with earlier research.
   Design/methodology/approach - A telephone interview survey approach is
   adopted encompassing both quantitative and qualitative open-ended
   questions with a sample of 167 UK companies stratified by firm size and
   industry sector.
   Findings - The majority of firms are undertaking efforts to reduce their
   environmental impacts, yet economic considerations such as cost and risk
   reductions and achieving compliance with environmental legislation
   dominate firms' environmental behaviour. Especially small and
   medium-sized firms appear to rely on relatively short-term planning
   horizons, which ultimately prevent them from becoming more proactive in
   their environmental outlook. Comparison with earlier studies suggests
   that the overall behaviour of firms towards environmental issues remains
   reactive and economically-oriented.
   Research limitations/implications - Despite the growing salience of many
   enviromnental challenges, businesses fail to employ more proactive
   environmental strategies, suggesting that more has to be done at policy
   level to stimulate the incentives involved with adopting such an
   approach.
   Originality/value - By using a mixed methods approach the paper aims to
   overcome problems of respondent identification and social desirability

   good or service via embedded transactions, rather than from strangers.
   While this previous work explains variation in embedded exchange across
   different types of purchases, it does not address variation in embedded
   exchange across persons. Our research integrates the embeddedness and
   trust literatures to explain variation in within-network exchanges based
   on an interaction of the purchaser's generalized trust and the level of
   uncertainty entailed in the purchase (i.e., whether there exists an
   incentive for the seller to misrepresent the quality of some good or
   service). For purchases involving uncertainty, low-trusters will tend to
   forgo risky transactions with strangers, opting instead for the
   increased certainty of embedded markets. High-trusters, on the other
   hand, will be more likely to transact with strangers (despite the
   increased risk), from whom they can often find better deals. We should
   not expect any differences between high- and low-trusters for products
   that do not entail uncertainty. Results from two data sources, responses
   from a nationally representative survey of the U.S. population and
   behavioral responses in new laboratory experiments, provide support for
   the arguments. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Amending the Incentive for Strategic Bias in Stated Preference Studies
   Case Study in Users' Valuation of Rolling Stock}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2008}},
Number = {{2049}},
Pages = {{128-135}},
Abstract = {{Stated preference (SP) methods have been used extensively in transport
   research and elsewhere, both to forecast demand and to value the
   importance attached to different product features and travel attributes.
   Before introducing new or refurbished rolling stock as part of their
   franchises, British Train Operating Companies (TOCs) have often carried
   out SP surveys to investigate passenger preferences and to test whether
   the improvement of the fleet and services is enough to recover the cost
   through increased fares and patronage and thus to evaluate the costs and
   benefits of this investment. The rolling stock value derived from SP
   results is used not only for welfare appraisal and pricing but also for
   rail demand forecasting. Alongside the broader acceptance and wider
   application of SP methods, some practitioners have argued for greater
   openness in discussing what they have seen as significant concerns
   surrounding SP. The issue of the strategic biasing of SP responses was
   specifically addressed by examining the incentive compatibility of SP
   responses related to task complexity and the presence of specific
   antibias warnings in the questionnaire. Methods to amend incentive to
   bias were suggested. Adding cheap talk script reduces the overestimation
   of valuation of improved rolling stock in the case study; however, bias
   may remain. Adding more attributes to the SP experiment does not show a
   significant impact on the estimation bias, but contributes to a higher
   error variance in responses.}},

Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1732-1741}},
Abstract = {{Although the successful enhancement of householders' participation in
   kerbside recycling schemes is essential for household waste recycling
   schemes to reach their desired levels of achievement, our understanding
   of householders' responses to the various incentives available to waste
   managers is incomplete. In particular, whether and how the recycling
   behaviour of householders may be favourably altered through imposition
   of financial penalties or rewards is not fully understood. Surveys of
   householders' attitudes in the London Borough of Havering, served by a
   kerbside co-mingled survival bag recycling scheme, showed they might be
   better encouraged to recycle more through improvements to structural and
   promotional aspects of the recycling scheme than through imposition of
   financial incentives. If financial incentives were to be imposed to
   enhance kerbside recycling, householders preferred: (1) rewards to
   penalties, and (2) community-based rewards and local taxation rebates to
   other or individual rewards. Given the attitudes of householders and the
   resources that would be needed to monitor their recycling behaviour as a
   basis for delivering financial incentives, it is suggested that the
   priority for enhancing recycling should be to make appropriate
   improvements in the infrastructure and support of the kerbside scheme

Abstract = {{Objective: Our aim was to analyze monetary incentives and shortening the
   questionnaire as means of increasing response rates in a mailed
   follow-up survey 1 year after inpatient psychotherapeutic treatment.
   Additionally, effects on partial nonresponse and the assessment of
   treatment outcome were examined.
   Study Design and Setting: In a 2 x 2 factorial design, a sample of 3,825
   patients was randomized to the two following interventions: (1)
   receiving a prepaid monetary incentive or none; and (2) getting a short
   or a long questionnaire. Treatment outcome was measured prospectively by
   a self-assessment instrument for psychopathology.
   Results: When using incentives, the response rate significantly
   increased by 7.3\% (95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 2.6-11.9\%).
   Receiving a short questionnaire led to an augmentation of the response
   rate of 3.7\% (95\% CI 0.9-8.3\%), which was not significant. The
   corresponding odds ratios were significantly increased for monetary
   incentives (1.36; 95\% CI 1.30-1.88), and when abridging the
   questionnaire (1.15; 95\% CI 1.01-1.31). However, partial nonresponse

Abstract = {{Context: Rural communities, often with complex health care issues, have
   difficulty creating and sustaining an adequate health professional
   workforce. Purpose: To identify factors associated with rural
   recruitment and retention of graduates from a variety of health
   professional programs in the southwestern United States. Methods: A
   survey collecting longitudinal data was mailed to graduates from 12
   health professional programs in New Mexico. First rural and any rural
   employment since graduation were outcomes for univariate analyses.
   Multivariate analysis that controlled for extraneous variables explored
   factors important to those who took a first rural position, stayed
   rural, or changed practice locations. Findings: Of 1,396 surveys
   delivered, response rate was 59\%. Size of childhood town, rural
   practicum completion, discipline, and age at graduation were associated
   with rural practice choice (P < .05). Those who first practiced in rural
   versus urban areas were more likely to view the following factors as
   important to their practice decision: community need, financial aid,
   community size, return to hometown, and rural training program
   participation (P < .05). Those remaining rural versus moving away were
   more likely to consider community size and return to hometown as
   important (P < .05). Having enough work available, income potential,
   professional opportunity, and serving community health needs were
   important to all groups. Conclusion: Rural background and preference for
   smaller sized communities are associated with both recruitment and
   retention. Loan forgiveness and rural training programs appear to
   support recruitment. Retention efforts must focus on financial
   incentives, professional opportunity, and desirability of rural
   locations.}},

Abstract = {{Context Value-based purchasing by employers has often been portrayed as
   the lynch-pin to quality improvement in a market-based health care
   system. Although a small group of the largest national employers has
   been actively engaged in promoting quality measurement, reporting, and
   pay for performance, it is unknown whether these ideas have
   significantly permeated employer-sponsored health benefit purchasing.
   Objective To provide systematic descriptions and analyses of value-based
   purchasing and related efforts to improve quality of care by health care
   purchasers.
   Design, Setting, and Participants We conducted telephone interviews with
   executives at 609 of the largest employers across 41 US markets between
   July 2005 and March 2006. The 41 randomly selected markets have at least
   100 000 persons enrolled in health maintenance organizations, include
   approximately 91\% of individuals enrolled in health maintenance
   organizations nationally, and represent roughly 78\% of the US
   metropolitan population. Using the Dun \& Bradstreet database of US
   employers, we identified the 26 largest firms in each market. Firms
   ranged in size from 60 to 250 000 employees.
   Main Outcome Measure The degree to which value-based purchasing and
   related strategies are reported being used by employers. Percentages
   were weighted by number of employees.
   Results Of 1041 companies contacted, 609 employer representatives
   completed the survey (response rate, 64\%). A large percentage of
   surveyed executives reported that they examine health plan quality data
   (269 respondents; 65\% {[}95\% confidence interval \{CI\}, 57\%-74\%]; P
   <. 001), but few reported using it for performance rewards (49
   respondents; 17\% {[} 95\% CI, 7\%-27\%]; P=.008) or to influence
   employees (71 respondents; 23\% {[} 95\% CI, 13\%-33\%]). Physician
   quality information is even less commonly examined (71 respondents; 16\%
   {[} 95\% CI, 9\%-23\%]) or used by employers to reward performance (8
   respondents; 2\% {[} 95\% CI, 0\%-3\%]) or influence employee choice of
   providers (34 respondents; 8\% {[} 95\% CI, 3\%-12\%]).
   Conclusion Surveyed employers as a whole do not appear to be
   individually implementing incentives and programs in line with
   value-based purchasing ideals.}},

Abstract = {{Land abandonment is causing woodland expansion and loss of open habitats
   in the Alps, coupled with a shift in forestry practices from coppice
   management to high forest. Despite such rapid large-scale changes, there
   has been very little investigation of the environmental predictors of
   biodiversity in the Alpine landscape. We assessed the richness of
   amphibians, reptiles and breeding birds (n = 189 species), used as a
   surrogate of biodiversity, in 58 quadrats of 100 km(2), located within a
   well surveyed area of the province of Trento (central-eastern Italian
   Alps). The surrogates were then related to a series of environmental
   variables by means of stepwise multiple regression. Depending on the
   surrogate analysed, species richness declined linearly or quadratically
   with elevation, and increased with habitat heterogeneity and the
   availability of grassland and arid-rocky habitats. The same results were
   obtained when incorporating a measure of species threat into the
   biodiversity estimates. Different surrogates were positively
   inter-correlated, probably because of a common response to the same
   factor, namely elevation, which was the only variable to enter all
   models. Such elevational gradient produced a clear biodiversity peak in
   low-elevation areas, generating potential conflict between efficient
   biodiversity conservation and economic interests linked to human
   development, a scenario which probably applies to many mountain regions
   worldwide. The current network of protected areas was quite satisfactory
   in terms of area covered but biased towards high-elevation areas, of
   high scenic beauty but relatively low in animal biodiversity value.
   Low-elevation reserves were small and isolated. Proposed conservation
   targets include the establishment of corridors increasing the
   connectivity of low-elevation reserves and the promotion of incentives
   for the extensive management of grassland, an agro-ecosystem of high
   historical and biological value.}},

Abstract = {{This paper argues that labor market conditions are an important and
   often overlooked determinant of retirement transitions. In our analysis,
   we examine how the unemployment rate affects retirement and whether the
   Social Security (SS) system and Unemployment Insurance (UI) system
   influence how older workers respond to labor market shocks. We use
   pooled cross-sectional data from the March Current Population Survey
   (CPS) in our analysis. We find that downturns in the labor market
   increase retirement transitions and that the magnitude of this effect is
   comparable to that associated with moderate changes in financial
   incentives to retire and to the threat of a health shock facing older
   workers. Interestingly, retirements only increase in response to an
   economic downturn once workers become SS-eligible, suggesting that
   retirement benefits may help to alleviate the income loss associated
   with a weak labor market. We also estimate the impact of UI generosity
   on retirement and find little consistent evidence of an effect. This
   suggests that in some ways SS may serve as a more effective form of
   unemployment insurance for older workers than UI. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

   would detract from investment in renewable energy technologies. Half of

Abstract = {{Certain survey characteristics proven to affect response rates, such as
   a survey's length and topic, are often under limited control of the
   researcher. Therefore, survey researchers sometimes seek to compensate
   for such undesired effects on response rates by employing
   countermeasures such as material or nonmaterial incentives. The scarce
   evidence on those factors' effects in web survey contexts is far from
   being conclusive. This study is aimed at filling this gap by examining
   the effects of four factors along with selected interactions presumed to
   affect response rates in web surveys. Requests to complete a web-based,
   self-administered survey were sent to 2,152 owners of personal websites.
   The 2 X 2 X 2 X 2 fully crossed factorial design encompassed the
   experimental conditions of (a) high versus low topic salience, (b) short
   versus long survey, (c) lottery incentive versus no incentive, and (d)
   no feedback and general feedback (study results) versus personal
   feedback (individual profile of results). As expected, highly salient
   and shorter surveys yielded considerably higher unit-response rates.
   Moreover, partial support was found for interaction hypotheses derived
   from the leverage-salience theory of survey participation. Offering
   personalized feedback compensated for the negative effects of low topic
   salience on response rates. Also, the lottery incentive tended to evoke
   more responses only if the survey was short (versus long), but this
   interaction effect was only marginally significant. The results stress
   the usefulness of a multifactorial approach encompassing interaction
   effects to understand participation differences in web surveys.}},

   the intrinsic reasons for precepting (i.e., enjoyment of teaching)
   rather than extrinsic rewards (such as no-cost online library
   resources). Degree groups placed differing values on intrinsic and
   extrinsic rewards. Physicians reported more negativity about the
   influence of students and regarding aspects of their professional lives.
   Conclusions Tailoring support to better meet individual degree groups'
   preferences can maximize resources and may encourage preceptor
   retention. Special attention to physicians' needs may be warranted to
   avoid decreased preceptor numbers in this at-risk group. Future studies
   are needed to determine whether these findings are unique to North
   Carolina, which has a strong infrastructure to support preceptors.}},

Abstract = {{Given the paucity of objective information on neuromuscular electrical
   stimulation approaches to dysphagia therapy, and the expanding
   utilization of this clinical approach, we designed and conducted two
   surveys to gather large-scale information regarding reported practice
   patterns, outcomes, complications, and professional perceptions
   associated with electrical stimulation approaches to dysphagia therapy.
   Self-administered questionnaires were mailed to 1000 randomly selected
   speech-language pathologists in each of two groups: (1) clinicians who
   had completed a formal electrical stimulation training course and were
   actively using these techniques, and (2) clinicians who were members of
   Special Interest Division 13 of the American Speech-Language and Hearing
   Association. Survey responses were anonymous and no incentive to respond
   was included. Acceptable response rates were achieved for both surveys
   (47\% and 48\%). Both groups of respondents were demographically similar
   and reported similar practice patterns. Stroke Was the most common
   etiology of dysphagia treated with this approach. The majority of
   respondents identified no specific dysphagia criteria for application of
   electrical stimulation, used varied behavioral treatment methods, and
   did not follow patients beyond therapy. Clinicians reported positive
   outcomes with no treatment-related complications. Satisfaction with this
   approach was reported to be high among patients and professionals.
   Clinicians who did not report using these techniques indicated that they
   were waiting for more objective information on clinical outcomes and
   safety. Results of these surveys form an initial description of practice
   patterns and outcomes associated with electrical stimulation approaches
   to dysphagia therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study sought to explore physician organizations'
   adoption of chronic care guidelines in order entry systems and to
   investigate the organizational and market-related factors associated
   with this adoption.
   Design: A quantitative nationwide survey of all primary care medical
   groups in the United States with 20 or more physicians; data were
   collected on 1,104 physician organizations, representing a 70\% response
   rate.
   Measurements: Measurements were the presence of an asthma, diabetes, or
   congestive heart failure guideline in a physician organization's order
   entry system; size; age of the organization; number of clinic locations;
   type of ownership; health maintenance organization market penetration;
   urban/rural location; and presence of external incentives to improve
   quality of care.
   Results: Only 27\% of organizations reported access to order entry with
   decision support for chronic disease care. External incentives for
   quality is the only factor significantly associated with adoption of
   these tools. Organizations experiencing greater external incentives for
   quality are more likely to adopt order entry with decision support.
   Conclusion: Because external incentives are strong drivers of adoption,
   policies requiring reporting of chronic care measurements and rewarding
   improvement as well as financial incentives for use of specific
   information technology tools are likely to accelerate adoption of order
   entry with decision support.}},

   Results. A model of nursing homes' behavior predicted that the report

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CRITICAL CARE}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{89-96}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The aim of this study was to describe hospital efforts to meet
   the Leapfrog Group's intensive care unit (ICU) physician staffing (IPS)
   standard; compare adopters and committers with resisters relative to
   perceived benefits, barriers and motivating factors; and examine
   implementation strategies.
   Materials and Methods: Chief medical officers (CMO) and ICU directors at
   hospitals in 6 US regions were surveyed between August 2003 and January
   2004. Hospital classifications were based on level of IPS implementation
   pioneer (met before IPS), adopter (met after IPS by 2002 Leapfrog
   survey), committer (not met but committed to December 2004
   implementation), and resister (refused to adopt IPS). Meeting IPS
   included intensivist staffing, 8 hours/day 7 days/week; sole patient
   care in ICU; 95\% pager response time <= 5 minutes; and physicians
   certified in critical care.
   Results: Forty-three (80\%) CMOs and 42 (78\%) ICU directors were
   interviewed. Adopters (100\%), committers (80\%), and resisters (45\%)
   employed intensivists; 1 adopter (14\%) met all criteria for standard.
   Main motivators for implementation were ``quality of patient care{''}
   for CMO (79\%) and ICU director (71\%) adopter/committers. Incentives to
   implement were increasing intensivist authority (90\% committers) and
   intensivist salary support (80\% committers and 70\% adopters). Main
   resister barriers were implementation costs (61\% CMOs) and medical
   staff controversy (55\% ICU directors).
   Conclusion: Most hospitals-including half of those who publicly resisted
   the standard-made attempts to change physician staffing in their ICUs,
   based on the criteria outlined by the Leapfrog Group. Major barriers
   that need addressing are implementation costs and convincing hospital
   organizations and medical staff regarding the benefits of adopting the
   standard. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{44}},

Pages = {{404-407}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background: As genetic testing becomes more common and increasingly
   intertwined with medical care, the issues of genetic privacy and doctor
   - patient confidentiality are being examined. Hereditary non- polyposis
   colorectal cancer ( HNPCC) is a genetic predisposition to colorectal and
   certain other cancers. Effective screening that can prevent colorectal
   cancer is an important incentive for genetic testing.
   Methods: A survey regarding the duty to warn family members of the risks
   associated with an HNPCC- causing mutation was mailed to 227
   participants in the Ontario Familial Colon Cancer Registry ( OFCCR). To
   our knowledge, the opinions of patients on this subject have not been
   reported previously in the literature. Responses were analysed
   quantitatively using the SAS system and qualitatively by the review of
   written comments.
   Results: Completed surveys were returned by 105 participants, with a
   response rate of 46.3\%. The majority felt a personal responsibility to
   warn relatives, but there was no significant agreement that doctors or
   genetic counsellors should have a duty to warn relatives without a
   patient's permission.
   Conclusions: Patients undergoing genetic testing for HNPCC generally
   understand that relatives could benefit from being informed of genetic
   risk, but may not be willing or able to inform each family member.
   Healthcare professionals should engage patients in a discussion of
   familial implications before genetic testing. An agreement should be
   formulated regarding which of the relatives should be informed. Patients
   should be encouraged to personally disseminate the information, given
   the unrealistic burden on practitioners to perform this task and
   patients' preference for control over the information.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Few studies have monitored physician supply in Canada, and
   no studies have specifically examined the Canadian plastic surgery
   workforce.
   Methods: In this study, data were gathered by three methods. A survey
   was distributed to all members of the Canadian Society of Plastic
   Surgeons in October of 2004. Opinions on the availability of plastic
   surgery services were solicited. A second survey that focused on
   demographics and workload was distributed in December of 2004. Finally,
   the locations of all Canadian trainees graduating between 1995 and 2005
   were reviewed.
   Results: The response rate to the first survey was 42 percent.
   Seventy-eight percent of respondents felt that there was a shortage of
   plastic surgeons in their community. The response rate to the second
   survey was 40 percent. Twenty-eight percent of respondents were within 5
   years of retirement and 3.2 percent stated that they planned to emigrate
   by 2010. The mean waiting time for an elective consultation was 32 +/-
   33 weeks. Review of all 179 plastic surgery graduates over the past 10
   years revealed that 23 percent now practice outside of Canada.
   Conclusions: When these results are projected to the total workforce,
   they indicate that there will be a future shortage of plastic surgeons
   in Canada. To prevent a further deficit, there is a need to increase the
   number of plastic surgery trainees in Canada, to offer incentives for
   graduates to stay in Canada, and to possibly recruit more
   foreign-trained plastic surgeons to practice within Canada.}},

   questionnaire, we surveyed program directors of nonmilitary family
   medicine residencies in the United States, with a response rate of
   60.7\%. Results: Among residency programs who tried to recruit faculty
   with delivery skills, 58\% stated that they have difficulties. Two
   program characteristics were associated with recruitment difficulties:
   the number of delivery providers among faculty and whether the residency
   program directors included delivery in their own practices. There were
   no statistically significant associations between recruiting
   difficulties and any type of financial reimbursement methods, but
   nonfinancial incentives were offered more often by programs that had no
   difficulty recruiting. Conclusions: More than half of all family
   medicine residency programs have difficulty recruiting faculty members
   to provide delivery training. Changing the type of financial
   compensation for faculty providing maternity care is not likely to
   assist in recruiting. However, we did find that programs without
   recruiting difficulties were more likely to offer nonfinancial
   incentives to faculty members who perform deliveries.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the results of an exploratory field experiment in
   Singapore that assessed the values of two types of privacy assurance:
   privacy statements and privacy seals. We collaborated with a local firm
   to host the experiment on its website with its real domain name, and the
   subjects were not informed of the experiment. Hence, the study provided
   afield observation of the subjects' behavioral responses toward privacy
   assurances. We found that (1) the existence of a privacy statement
   induced more subjects to disclose their personal information but that of
   a privacy seal did not; (2) monetary incentive had a positive influence
   on disclosure; and (3) information request had a negative influence on
   disclosure. These results were robust in other specifications that used
   alternative measures for some of our model variables. We discuss this
   study in relation to the extant privacy literature, most of which
   employs surveys and laboratory experiments for data collection, and draw
   related managerial implications.}},

Abstract = {{Background: In the past decade, health insurers have increased their
   reliance on cost control policies such as prior authorization and 3-tier
   formularies. Little is known about how these policies are being applied
   to psychotropic medications, many of which have low rates of patient
   adherence.
   Objective: This study reports on plans' cost-sharing tier placement and
   authorization policies for 12 brand-only psychotropic medications in 3
   classes: antidepressants, antipsychotics, and medications for
   attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
   Methods: Data were from a nationally representative survey of private
   health plans regarding mental health and substance-abuse services in
   2003; 368 plans responded (83\% response rate). Results were weighted
   and represent national estimates of health-plan characteristics.
   Results: The majority of insurance products provided unrestricted
   placement on Tier 2 (medium co-payment) for at least 2 brand-only
   antidepressants and at least 2 brand-only antipsychotics. This approach
   allows clinicians some limited leeway in initial medication selection.
   However, most patients who did not respond to the Tier-2 options
   typically faced a substantial escalation in copayment (Tier 3), possibly
   leading to premature medication discontinuation. For ADHD, the options
   were considerably more limited, with 22.1\% of products applying some
   restriction to all 3 medications and only 15.9\% of products leaving all
   3 medications unrestricted. Plans with specialty contracts for mental
   health were considerably more likely to use Tier 3 (highest copayment)
   as their only restriction approach.
   Conclusions: Based on the results of this analysis, private plans were
   managing psychotropic costs using copayment incentives rather than
   administrative controls. This approach was less intrusive for
   clinicians, but resulting higher copayments could worsen already high
   rates of nonadherence; future research should examine this issue.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study evaluated the perceptions of research, frequency
   of use of research findings in practice, and the level of research
   skills of chiropractors and massage therapists in Canada. Predictors of
   application of research findings in clinical practice were also
   explored.
   Methods: A survey was mailed to members of the College of Chiropractors
   of Alberta (n = 833) and the Massage Therapist Association of Alberta (n
   650). Univariate and logistic regression analysis were conducted with
   SPSS and Stata.
   Results: A total of 483 questionnaires were returned (response rate,
   32.6\%). Chiropractors and massage therapists reported an overall
   positive perception toward research, acknowledging the importance of
   research to validate their practice. Although both groups felt
   comfortable using the library, they had little confidence in their
   research skills and overall application of research in practice was
   limited. Significant differences were found between the 2 professional
   groups, with chiropractors reporting more research skills and
   evidence-based practice. Primary discipline, frequent referral to
   peer-reviewed journals, and strong agreement with the statement that
   ``research adds credibility to my discipline{''} were predictors of
   research application in practice.
   Conclusion: It appears that in Canada neither chiropractors nor massage
   therapists consistently apply research in practice, which may result
   from a lack of research education and research skills. The differences
   between the 2 professional groups may be attributed to the chiropractic
   profession's relatively more research-focused professional training.
   Strategies to encourage greater research uptake and evidence-based
   behavior by practitioners include professional association incentives,
   Such as education credits or practitioner cooperatives that would
   provide time and support for research.}},

Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JAN 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: Often in survey research, subsets of the population invited
   to complete the survey do not respond in a timely manner and valuable
   resources are expended in recontact efforts. Various methods of
   improving response have been offered, such as reducing questionnaire
   length, offering incentives, and utilizing reminders; however, these
   methods can be costly. Utilizing characteristics of early responders
   (refusal or consent) in enrollment and recontact efforts may be a unique
   and cost-effective approach for improving the quality of epidemiologic
   research.
   Methods: To better understand early responders of any kind, we compared
   the characteristics of individuals who explicitly refused, consented, or
   did not respond within 2 months from the start of enrollment into a
   large cohort study of US military personnel. A multivariate
   polychotomous logistic regression model was used to estimate the effect
   of each covariate on the odds of early refusal and on the odds of early
   consent versus late/non-response, while simultaneously adjusting for all
   other variables in the model.
   Results: From regression analyses, we found many similarities between
   early refusers and early consenters. Factors associated with both early
   refusal and early consent included older age, higher education, White
   race/ethnicity, Reserve/Guard affiliation, and certain information
   technology and support occupations.
   Conclusion: These data suggest that early refusers may differ from
   late/non-responders, and that certain characteristics are associated
   with both early refusal and early consent to participate. Structured
   recruitment efforts that utilize these differences may achieve early
   response, thereby reducing mail costs and the use of valuable resources
   in subsequent contact efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Relationships between aberrant social functioning and
   depression have been explored via behavioral, clinical, and survey
   methodologies, highlighting their importance in the etiology of
   depression. The neural underpinnings of these relationships, however,
   have not been explored.
   Methods. Nine depressed participants and 14 never-depressed control
   subjects viewed emotional and neutral pictures at two functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning sessions approximately 22
   weeks apart. In the interim, depressed patients received the
   antidepressant Venlafaxine. Positively rated images were parsed into
   three separate comparisons: social interaction, human faces, and sexual
   images; across scanning session, activation to these images was compared
   with other positively rated images.
   Results. For each of the three social stimulus types (social
   interaction, faces, sexual images), a distinguishable circuitry was
   activated equally in non-depressed control subjects and post-treatment
   depressed subjects but showed a hypo-response in the depressed group
   pre-treatment. These structures include regions of prefrontal, temporal,
   and parietal cortices, insula, basal ganglia, and the hippocampus.
   Conclusions: The neural hypo-response to positively valenced social
   stimuli that is observed in depression remits as response to
   antidepressant medication occurs, suggesting a state-dependent
   deficiency in response to positive social incentives, These findings
   underscore the importance of addressing social dysfunction in research

Journal = {{RANGELAND ECOLOGY \& MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{632-639}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In response to substantial economic and social dislocations in the
   United States, many rangeland owners are changing land use and
   management practices. Changes in land use can significantly affect the
   services rangeland ecosystems provide. Decisions associated with such
   changes are likely mediated by landowner views regarding individual
   rights, social responsibilities, and the future security of property
   rights. In this paper, we examine the extent to which landowners are
   likely to adopt, without public compensation, socially desirable land
   management objectives that enhance ecosystem services from rangelands.
   The study consisted of a mail survey of landowners with at least 40 ha:
   500 in Texas, 500 in Utah, and 694 in Colorado. Adjusted response rates
   were 62\% in Texas, 46\% in Utah, and 51\% in Colorado. Regression
   analyses showed that willingness to adopt socially desirable rangeland
   management objectives was positively correlated with the social
   responsibility dimension of respondents' property rights orientations
   but negatively correlated with the rights erosion dimension. Our results
   also suggested that landowners in private land states, such as Texas,
   might be less willing than landowners in states with more public land to
   manage their land for the maintenance of ecosystem services without
   being compensated. Although the scope of our study was limited, the
   results suggest that agencies tasked with maintaining ecosystem services
   on private rangelands might more successfully achieve their mission by
   promoting social responsibility among landowners. Including community
   leaders with a highly developed sense of social responsibility in
   programs aimed at improving land stewardship and including peer-pressure
   incentives in such programs might enhance social responsibility
   perspectives among landowners. Such programs should also be adaptable at
   the state-level to account for differences in property-rights
   orientations relative to landowner dependence on private and public
   land.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural policy has in the last 50 years taken much of the risk and
   the initiative away from Norwegian farm forest owners. Subsidies in
   agriculture have guaranteed an acceptable income and there has been
   neither need nor incentives for starting up new activities at the farms.
   This situation is now gradually changing. The income both from
   agriculture and forestry is decreasing and farm forest owners have
   either to move, to find job opportunities outside the farm or to start
   up new activity at the farm using the farm's resources. Entrepreneurship
   theory is used to study the question why some farm forest owners choose
   to start up some new activity based on the forest resources they have.
   We identify two main elements of entrepreneurship; the ability to
   recognise business opportunities and the ability to take calculated
   risk. In a survey to 500 forest owners in southern Norway (response rate
   45\%), we included questions about opportunity recognition and risk
   aversion. From the answers, we were able to split the forest owners in
   two groups, those with entrepreneurial attitudes and those without.
   Using logistic regression we found a significantly higher probability
   for start-up of new activities in the group with entrepreneurial
   attitudes. This result has very interesting policy implications. Many
   studies show that entrepreneurial attitudes to a large degree can be
   learnt. The first way of learning about entrepreneurship is through the
   education system and through courses and training of forest owners. The
   other way is `learning by doing', which is most probably the most
   efficient way to learn about entrepreneurship. Public policy should
   stimulate more owners to `do', by that they will `learn' and that will
   again lead to more entrepreneurial activities at the holdings. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{To develop an instrument for assessing physician attitudes toward
   quality incentive programs, and to assess its reliability and validity.
   Study involved primary data collection. A 40-item paper and pencil
   survey of primary care physicians in Rochester, New York, and
   Massachusetts was conducted between May 2004 and December 2004.
   Seven-hundred and ninety-eight completed questionnaires were received,
   representing a response rate of 32 percent (798/2,497).
   Based on an extensive review of the literature and discussions with
   experts in the field, we developed a conceptual framework representing
   the features of pay-for-performance (P4P) programs hypothesized to
   affect physician behavior in that context. A draft questionnaire was
   developed based on that conceptual model and pilot tested in three
   groups of physicians. The questionnaire was modified based on the
   physician feedback, and the revised version was distributed to 2,497
   primary care physicians affiliated with two of the seven sites
   participating in Rewarding Results, a national evaluation of quality
   target and financial incentive programs.
   Respondents were randomly divided into a derivation and a validation
   sample. Exploratory factor analysis was applied to the responses of the
   derivation sample. Those results were used to create scales in the
   validation sample, and these were then subjected to multitrait analysis
   (MTA). One scale representing physicians' perception of the impact of
   P4P on their clinical practice was regressed on the other scales as a
   test of construct validity.
   Seven constructs were identified and demonstrated substantial convergent
   and discriminant validity in the MTA: awareness and understanding,
   clinical relevance, cooperation, unintended consequences, control,
   financial salience, and impact. Internal consistency reliabilities
   (Cronbach's alpha coefficients) ranged from 0.50 to 0.80. A
   statistically significant 25 percent of the variation in perceived
   impact was accounted for by physician perceptions of the other six
   characteristics of P4P programs.
   It is possible to identify and measure the key salient features of P4P
   programs using a valid and reliable 26-item survey. This instrument may
   now be used in further studies to better understand the impact of P4P
   programs on physician behavior.}},

   obstetrician-gynaecologists on intimate partner violence in Flanders,
   Belgium}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) has consistently been found
   to afflict one in twenty pregnant women and is therefore considered a
   leading cause of physical injury, mental illness and adverse pregnancy
   outcome. A general antenatal screening policy has been advocated, though
   compliance with such guidelines tends to be low. We therefore attempted
   to identify potential barriers to IPV screening in a context where no
   guidelines have been instigated yet.
   Methods: Questionnaire-based Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice survey
   among obstetrician-gynaecologists in Flanders, Belgium (n = 478).
   Results: The response rate was 52.1\% (249/478). Gynaecologists prove
   rather unfamiliar with IPV and therefore largely underestimate the
   extent of the problem. Merely 6.8\% (17/249) of the respondents ever
   received or pursued any kind of education on IPV. Accordingly they do
   feel insufficiently skilled to deal with IPV, yet sufficiently capable
   of recognizing IPV among their patients. Survey participants largely
   refute the incentive of universal screening in favour of opportunistic
   screening and do not consider pregnancy as a window of opportunity for
   routine screening. They do consider screening for IPV as an issue of
   medical liability and therefore do not suffer from a lack of motivation
   to screen. In addition, obstetrician-gynaecologists do believe that
   screening for IPV may be an effective means to counteract abusive
   behaviours. Yet, their outcome expectancy is weighed down by their
   perceived lack of self-efficacy in dealing with IPV, by lack of
   familiarity with referral procedures and by their perceived lack of
   available referral services. Major external or patient-related barriers
   to IPV screening included a perceived lack of time and fear of offending
   or insulting patients. Overall, merely 8.4\% (21/245) of gynaecologists
   in this survey performed some kind of IPV questioning on a regular
   basis. Finally, physician education was found to be the strongest
   predictor of a positive attitude towards screening and of current
   screening practices.
   Conclusion: Endorsement of physician training on IPV is an important
   first step towards successful implementation of screening guidelines for
   IPV. Additional introduction of enabling and reinforcement strategies
   such as screening tools, patient leaflets, formal referral pathways, and
   physician feedback may further enhance compliance with screening
   recommendations and guidelines.}},

Abstract = {{Will changing the Dutch electoral system to give MPs a stronger personal
   mandate affect parliamentary group unity in the Dutch parliament? To
   discuss this question, we first describe Parliamentary Party Group (PPG)
   unity in the Dutch Tweede Kamer. Placing the Dutch case in perspective,
   we find that group unity is comparatively high. Surveying next the
   analytical literature to establish the relative merits of sociological,
   institutional and electoral system variables, we find the impact of
   intra-parliamentary factors to be strong. Institutional incentives to
   stay united in political struggles weigh heavily when explaining why
   most West European parliaments score high on PPG unity, regardless of
   electoral systems in general and preferential voting arrangements in
   particular. We also stress the likely strategic party responses to
   electoral change, for example, by revising candidate selection
   procedures to reduce the possibilities of unwanted NIP independence in
   parliaments. A stronger personal mandate may, nevertheless, give a
   moderate rise in the numerous ways in which MPs can communicate their
   personal qualities and party independence to their voters.}},

Title = {{Physicians' perceptions of relevant prescription drug costs: Do costs to

Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MANAGED CARE}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{9}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: Physicians may be aware of at least 2 types of costs when
   prescribing: patient's out-of-pocket costs and the actual costs of the
   medication. We evaluated physicians' perceptions, about relevant costs
   for prescription drugs and the importance of communication about these
   costs.
   Study Design: Mailed survey to a random sample of 1200 physician members
   of the California Medical Association, and a phone survey of a sample of
   nonresponders.
   Methods: Descriptive statistics of survey items, McNemar's test to
   compare survey item responses, and logistic regression to evaluate the
   relationship between physician, practice, and system variables and
   physicians' perceptions of relevant medication costs.
   Results: Of respondents with correct addresses, 49.6\% responded to the
   survey; 13\% of nonresponders were contacted by phone. Approximately
   91\% and 80\% of physicians reported that it is important to manage
   patients' out-of-pocket costs and total medication costs, respectively.
   When comparing the relative importance of managing the 2 types of costs,
   59\% of physicians agreed that managing patients' out-of-pocket costs
   was more important than managing the total medication costs and only
   16\% disagreed. Physicians believed it was more important to discuss
   out-of-pocket costs than total costs with patients (P < .0001), but only
   15\% of physicians reported discussing out-of-pocket costs frequently
   and 5\% reported talking about total medication costs frequently.
   Physicians who managed more Medicare patients had a greater likelihood
   than physicians managing fewer Medicare patients of prioritizing
   out-of-pocket cost rather than total cost management (P = .038), and
   generalists had a greater likelihood than medical subspecialists (P =
   .046).
   Conclusions: Physicians prioritize managing out-of-pocket costs over
   total medication costs. Pharmacy benefit designs that use patient
   out-of-pocket cost incentives to influence utilization are addressing
   the costs to which physicians may be most responsive. When physicians
   face conflicts between managing patients' out-of-pocket costs and total
   costs, they will likely try to protect the patients' resources at the
   expense of the insurer or society. Efforts to align patients',
   insurers', and societies' incentives will simplify prescribing decisions
   and result in better value in prescribing.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Most insurers in the US have implemented incentive-based
   formularies that rely on out-of-pocket costs to influence prescription
   drug utilization. Medicare Part D plans have broadly adopted such
   benefit designs.
   OBJECTIVE: To evaluate physicians' perceptions of their knowledge of
   formularies and out-of-pocket costs, factors that influence knowledge of
   costs, physicians' perceived responsibility for helping patients manage
   their out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs, and physicians'
   perceptions of the role of pharmacists in managing these costs.
   METHODS: A multiple-choice survey was mailed to a random sample of 1200
   physician members of the California Medical Association; a phone survey
   of nonresponders was then conducted.
   RESULTS: Of 1027 surveys delivered to correct addresses, 509 (49.6\%)
   responses were received. Thirty-three percent of physicians reported
   that they were usually or always aware of patients' formularies and 20\%
   were usually or always aware of patients' out-of-pocket costs for
   medications. Surgeons, emergency department physicians, and physicians
   that prescribe from more formularies than other physicians are less
   likely to be aware of patients' out-of-pocket costs, while physicians in
   large practices and those who use computers to prescribe are more aware.
   While 91\% of physicians agreed that it is important that patients'
   out-of-pocket costs be managed, 40\% somewhat or strongly agreed that it
   is their responsibility to help. Sixty-five percent of physicians
   believed that it is the responsibility of the pharmacist to be familiar
   with patients' out-of-pocket costs.
   CONCLUSIONS: Physicians often lack the knowledge to assist patients in
   the management of their out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs and
   they depend on pharmacists to help patients manage those costs. Computer
   order entry and resources available in large physician organizations
   improve physicians' awareness of out-of-pocket costs when prescribing.}},

Title = {{Healthcare restructuring and hierarchical alignment - Why do staff and
   managers perceive change outcomes differently?}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL CARE}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{879-889}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Healthcare organizations have undergone major change efforts in
   the past decade. Sustained change is related to continued alignment
   among organizational participants and may fail with incongruent
   perceptions of change. This study identifies factors contributing to the
   alignment in perceptions of organizational change outcomes between
   executives and all other employees.
   Methodology: The sample included 10 hospitals with survey responses from
   421 executives and other employees. Using hierarchical linear modeling
   (HLM), perceptual alignment was modeled at the first level as a function
   of goal commitment, goal clarity, goal acceptance, goal specificity,
   staff participation, available skill set, and knowledge and at the
   second level as organizational size.
   Findings: Descriptive statistics showed employee perception of outcomes
   differed among personnel levels. HLM results showed that goal
   specificity, appropriate staff training, reward incentives, effective
   communication, information sharing, and organization's ability to
   sustain changes induced perceptual alignment in change outcomes. Staff
   involvement in designing change efforts increased perceptual
   misalignment, whereas involvement during implementation and maintenance
   phases increased alignment.
   Research Limitations: This research uses cross-sectional data from 10
   hospitals. Data were gathered from surveys that may have recall bias as
   hospitals were surveyed at different times after the implementation of
   their restructuring.
   Practical Implications: Our findings enhance the understanding of
   processes and mechanisms that enable healthcare organizations to align
   organizational participants' efforts during change. Results suggest that
   decision-makers should create incentives to encourage innovative
   practices, institute effective communication mechanisms, selectively
   disseminate information, and involve participants in implementing and
   maintaining changes to achieve intended outcomes.
   Originality/Value of Article: This article provides unique insight into
   the importance and causes of organizational alignment after major
   restructuring. Too often, organizations' change efforts fail after
   implementation. Effective change requires continued effort and alignment
   to embed the desired changes.}},

Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{365-389}},

Abstract = {{To comprehend how the welfare state adjusts to economic shocks it is
   important to get a handle on both the genesis of popular preferences and
   the institutional incentives for governments to respond to these
   preferences. This paper attempts to do both, using a general theoretical
   framework and detailed data at both the individual and national levels.
   In a first step, we focus on how risk exposure and income are related to
   preferences for redistribution. To test our hypotheses, we extract
   detailed risk-exposure measures from labour-force surveys and marry them
   to cross-national opinion survey data. Results from analysis of these
   data attest to the great importance of risks within the labour market in
   shaping popular preferences for redistributive efforts by governments.
   In a second step, we turn our attention to the supply side of government
   redistribution. Institutions, we argue, mediate governments' reactions
   to redistributional demands following economic shocks. Using time-series
   cross-country data, we demonstrate how national training systems, and
   electoral institutions, as well as partisanship, shape government

Abstract = {{hi this article, the authors discuss the results of an experiment

   presumed sensitive questions is administered via computer-assisted
   self-interviewing (CASI), instead of completely administering the
   questionnaire via computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI). No
   significant main effect of the promised incentive on the response rates
   could be found. There are, however; interactions between the incentive,
   gender, and ethnicity, which show that different subpopulations react
   differently to the promised incentive. Furthermore, there is no evidence
   that the data collected by means of CASI results in more valid answers.
   Still, when the data are collected by means of CASI a substantial
   increase in the rate of ``don't know{''} responses is observed.}},

Title = {{Use of a new combined vaccine in pediatric practices}},
Journal = {{PEDIATRICS}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{E251-E257}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. On December 13, 2002, Pediarix, a combination vaccine that
   contains diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis; hepatitis B; and
   inactivated polio vaccines, was licensed by the Food and Drug
   Administration for use in the primary immunization series. Use of this
   vaccine decreases the number of injections that children receive when
   completing their primary immunization series at the 2-, 4-, and 6-month
   well-child visits. The objective of this study was to determine the
   factors that influence the use of this combined vaccine in private
   pediatric practices, with particular attention to the perceived economic
   impact of Pediarix and actions taken to address this impact within the
   private pediatric setting.
   METHODS. A mail survey study was conducted of a random sample of 565
   practicing pediatricians that was obtained from the American Medical
   Association Masterfile. Frequency distributions were developed for all
   responses, and the vaccine financing policies of the state of practice
   for each respondent were determined. chi(2) analysis was performed to
   assess any associations of the predictor variables with the outcome
   variables of interest, use or consideration of use of the Pediarix
   vaccine. Logistic regression was used to determine the independent
   association of the predictor variables with use or consideration of use
   of Pediarix. Regression models that did and did not include practice
   ownership as a predictor variable were developed.
   RESULTS. Response rate was 63\%(N = 355). A total of 39\% (n = 123) of
   the respondents' practices were purchasing Pediarix for use with their
   private patients. An additional 18\% (n = 55) were considering
   purchasing the vaccine. Those who were in practices that were owned by
   hospitals or health systems were more likely than those who were in solo
   or group practices to purchase Pediarix for their private patients.
   Approximately half of the remaining respondents order Pediarix through
   their state immunization program. Among the 52\% of respondents who did
   not, 23\% reported that the vaccine was not yet available through their
   state program, and 47\% stated that they did not want to use different
   vaccines for their public and private patients. Only 11\% believed that
   Pediarix was not compatible with their other vaccine products.
   Physicians that currently were purchasing or considering purchasing
   Pediarix were more likely to be influenced by both parental and provider
   desire to decrease the number of injections at a single visit and the
   reduced time for immunization delivery. Fewer than 1\% of respondents
   reported either having experienced or expecting to experience a
   significant decrease in practice revenue as a result of the use of
   Pediarix.
   CONCLUSIONS. Although use of the vaccine results in fewer administration
   fees for most physicians, the magnitude of the change seemed not to be
   significant for the majority of respondents or was outweighed by other
   factors. It also is possible that larger practices or buying
   cooperatives were able to negotiate discounted rates for Pediarix
   relative to the constituent products. This may have been a strategy of
   manufacturers and/or distributors to provide incentive for practices to
   switch to the combination product. Of note was the appreciation of
   respondents for the preferences of patients for fewer vaccines and, to a
   lesser degree, for the decrease in office staff time required to provide
   vaccination with multiple antigens when using Pediarix. Also, the role
   of the availability of a given vaccine through the Vaccines for Children
   program is important in its adoption into practice.}},

Abstract = {{It has been argued that the traditional regulatory approach of the
   Endangered Species Act, based on land-use restrictions, has failed to

   This paper examines the potential of incentives programs to elicit
   conservation-oriented management choices from landowners. Data obtained
   from a survey of non-industrial private forest owners in Oregon and
   Washington is used to examine the effectiveness of various incentives.
   The results indicate that incentives, in particular compensation and
   assurances, can be effective in increasing the conservation effort
   provided by landowners. The results also suggest that conservation
   policy for private lands could be improved by relying on a combination
   of incentives, including financial incentives and assurances, rather

Abstract = {{Objectives: To report on the sixth survey of the Society for Academic
   Emergency Medicine (SAEM) of emergency medicine faculty salaries,

   Methods: Data represent compensation paid for the 2004-2005 academic
   year. Responses were collected by SAEM, and blinded program and
   individual faculty data were entered into a customized version of a
   relational database program with a built-in statistical package. Salary
   data were sorted by criteria such as program region, faculty title,
   American Board of Emergency Medicine certification, academic rank, years
   since completing residency, program size, and whether data were reported
   to the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC). Demographic data
   were analyzed with regard to numerous criteria including department
   staffing levels, emergency department (ED) volumes, ED length of stay,
   department income sources, salary incentive components, research
   funding, and specific type and value of fringe benefits offered. Data
   were compared with previous SAEM studies.
   Results: Sixty-one of 132 (46\%) accredited programs responded, yielding
   data on 1,213 full-time faculty from all four AAMC regions. Mean
   salaries were reported as follows: all faculty, \$189,848; first-year

Abstract = {{Inspired by the positive effects of incentives on mail survey response
   rates, researchers have started using incentives to increase response
   rates to Web surveys. The established best practice of presending cash
   incentives is difficult to implement in Web surveys, and studies suggest
   that its presumed effects might not be witnessed in Web surveys. In
   contrast, several studies have found that lotteries can significantly
   increase Web survey response rates. Some authors have argued that this
   could reflect the fact that Internet users have come to expect Web
   surveys to be associated with lotteries. An experimental study among
   university students found that the lottery influences the Web survey
   response rates, but there are indications that different subgroups might
   be more influenced by this incentive than others. The observed
   differences are interpreted along the lines of possible differences ill
   the degree to which different respondent groups expect incentives in
   return for their participation.}},

Volume = {{76}},

Abstract = {{In Sweden decentralised drug-budgets at health-care facility levels were
   introduced in 1997 in an attempt to contain increasing pharmaceutical
   expenditures. This paper reports the findings of a postal survey which
   investigates whether decentralised drug-budgets according to a so-called
   primary-care based model in Swedish health care have led to increased
   cost awareness and changed attitudes towards cost-minimisation and
   cost-effectiveness as decision-making criteria among physicians. In
   particular, it was investigated whether there were differences in this
   respect between general practitioners (GPs) and specialists. The postal
   survey was sent to 1520 Swedish physicians from a stratified sample of
   Swedish county councils. A total of 738 physicians responded (response
   rate 49\%). Statistical analysis was performed of logistic regression
   analysis and independent or paired samples t-tests. The results suggest
   that GPs have a higher degree of cost awareness than specialists.
   Physicians with experience of decentralised drug-budgets have a higher
   degree of cost awareness than other physicians. However, the rating of
   the top four decision-making criteria; therapeutic effects, side
   effects, compliance and cost-effectiveness, were not significantly
   different when comparing GPs against specialists, and physicians
   practising in county councils with decentralised drug-budgets against
   other physicians. The main barriers to considering costs to a greater
   extent were perceived difficulties in switching drugs and a fear among
   physicians of losing credibility among patients. In conclusion,
   decentralisation of drug-budgets according to the Swedish primary-care
   based model increases cost awareness, especially among GPs. Such
   responsibility, however, does not create strong incentives for
   physicians to reconsider the importance of cost-effectiveness in
   relation to other decision-making criteria when prescribing. Parallel
   interventions are needed to meet the objective of cost-effective
   prescribing. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Incentive-based formularies have been widely instituted to control the
   rising costs of prescription drugs. To work properly, such formularies
   depend on patients to be aware of financial incentives and communicate
   their cost preferences with prescribing physicians. The impact of
   financial incentives on patient awareness of and communication about
   those costs is unknown.
   To evaluate the relationship between enrollment in incentive-based
   pharmacy benefit plans and awareness of out-of-pocket costs and rates of
   communication about out-of-pocket costs.
   A matched telephone survey of patients and their primary care
   physicians.
   Los Angeles County.
   One thousand nine hundred and seventeen patients aged 53 to 82 (73\%
   response rate).
   Patient-reported pharmacy benefit design, knowledge of out-of-pocket
   costs, and discussion of out-of-pocket costs with physicians.
   Sixty-two percent of patients who had prescription drug coverage and
   were aware of their pharmacy benefit design reported being enrolled in
   incentive-based plans. The majority of these (54\%) were ``never{''} or
   only ``sometimes{''} aware of their out-of-pocket cost requirements at
   the time of the physician visit. After controlling for numerous
   physician and patient level variables, we found that patients enrolled
   in pharmacy benefit designs requiring no copayments were more likely to
   report they ``never{''} discuss out-of-pocket costs with physicians
   compared with patients enrolled in incentive-based pharmacy benefit
   designs (81\% vs 67\%, P = .001) and patients with no prescription drug
   insurance (57\%, P < .001).
   Incentive-based pharmacy benefit plans and lack of insurance are
   associated with increased rates of discussions about out-of-pocket
   costs. Nonetheless, most incentive-based enrollees are unaware of
   out-of-pocket costs when prescriptions are written and never discuss
   out-of-pocket costs with their physicians, likely mitigating the
   effectiveness of financial incentives to guide decision making.
   Considering that out-of-pocket costs are associated with adherence to
   medical therapy, interventions to improve patient access to
   out-of-pocket cost information and the frequency of patient-physician
   discussions about costs are needed.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Managed care organizations can increase the value of drug
   therapy by negotiating discounts on drug acquisition costs with
   pharmaceutical manufacturers and promoting use of preferred drugs,
   including the conversion of patients to preferred medications This
   investigation was designed to assess conversion success, migraine drug
   utilizations, and patient satisfaction with a clinical
   pharmacist-managed conversion program from sumatriptan to rizatriptan
   ODT, both formulary drugs.
   METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study conducted in a managed
   care organization for patents aged 18 years or older who had picked up
   at least one outpatient prescription for any sumatriptan dosage form at
   the pharmacy between January 2002 and June 2002. Patents' pharmacy and
   medical data were reviewed to assess eligibility (e.g., no history of
   rizatriptan failure) for conversion from sumatriptan to rizatriptan
   orally disintegrating tablet (ODT). There was no copayment difference
   for members for rizatriptan DDT versus sumatriptan. A questionnaire was
   developed to assess 2 domains. (1) patient satisfaction with the
   medication conversion process and (2) preference for rizatriptan DDT or
   sumatriptan. A random sample of 315 patents who initiated conversion to
   rizatriptan DDT was surveyed. Electronic pharmacy claims were reviewed
   to determine the number of patients who were successfully converted from
   sumatriptan to rizatriptan DDT Pharmacy expenditures and total health
   care utilization and expenditures in the 180 days prior to (baseline)
   and after the conversion (follow-up) to rizatriptan DDT were compared
   for the cohorts of subjects who were successfully converted and those
   patients who were not successfully converted.
   RESULTS: Therapeutic conversion from sumatriptan to rizatriptan DDT was
   attempted in 457 patients; 214 (47\%) were successfully converted The
   only difference between the 2 cohorts at baseline for the 6 months prior
   to attempted conversion was a higher mean number of sumatriptan doses
   per patient per month (PPPM) in the 243 failed conversions (mean 3 5, SD
   2.9) compared with the 214 successful conversions (mean 2.8, SD 2.8,
   P=0.003). The median triptan doses increased by 1.0 PPPM in both cohorts
   (P=0.882), from 2 0 to 3 0 doses PPPM in the group of successful
   conversions and from 2 7 to 4 0 in the group of unsuccessful
   conversions. The survey response rate was 55\% for both successful and
   for unsuccessful conversions. More than 90\% of the patients in both
   cohorts were satisfied with the level of care provided by the clinical
   pharmacy staff during medication conversion, and there was no difference
   between the 2 cohorts in patient satisfaction (P=0.761). Rizatriptan DDT
   was preferred by 68.0\% and 8.5\% of successful and failed conversion
   subjects, respectively (P<0 001). Using representative group purchase
   prices, triptan expenditures for successful conversion subjects were
   reduced by a median of -\$2 (6 \%) PPPM while triptan expenditures for
   unsuccessful conversions increased by a median of \$8 (P<0.001). There
   were no differences for either cohort in median PPPM changes in
   migraine-related office visits (0.0 median change in office visits,
   P=0.748) or office-visit costs (SO median change, P=0 861) for
   preconversion versus postconversion attempts Regression modeling
   identified that lower total counts of sumatriptan doses filled during
   baseline period was an independent predictor of successful conversion to
   rizatriptan DDT (P<0.001). There was an average of 3.5 triptan
   medication fills per patient for successful conversion during the
   6-month follow-up period, with 78\% of these subjects filling at least 2
   prescriptions for rizatriptan DDT during this period.
   CONCLUSIONS. This conversion program for sumatriptan to rizatriptan DDT
   was successful in converting almost half of primary care patients to the
   preferred product despite the absence of a copayment incentive for
   members to agree to the conversion. There were no measurable medical or
   economic consequences of the conversion, and patient satisfaction with
   the quality of care was maintained. Future efforts are likely to have a
   higher success rate if focused on converting patients with less-severe
   migraine headaches, as measured by the need for baseline rescue
   medication, since lower acuity was the only independent predictor of
   successful conversion in this conversion program for 2 triptan drugs.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments on incentives have a long history in survey research,
   particularly in mail surveys but increasingly in other modes too. Most
   of this work has focused on variations in incentive type, timing, and
   amount on response rates. There has been relatively little research
   examining the effect of different incentives on nonresponse error.
   Furthermore, most of the studies on incentives have been within a single
   mode. No studies, to our knowledge, have examined the effect of
   incentives in a study using more than one mode. This paper adds to the
   methodological literature on incentives in several ways. Although we
   compare a cash incentive vs. an in-kind incentive, which has been done
   several times, we examine these effects in both a face-to-face and mail
   survey. The cash incentive yielded higher response rates than the
   in-kind incentive in the mail survey. Furthermore, the in-kind incentive
   was related to one of the topics of a metropolitan area survey,
   permitting us to examine possible effects of the incentive on the
   composition of the resulting sample as an indicator of potential
   nonresponse error. Specifically, the in-kind incentive was a set of
   passes to regional parks, and the survey included a variety of questions
   on behavior and attitudes related to park use. We found that, although
   there were demographic differences between incentive groups, the
   response distributions on key related variables did not vary by
   incentive type.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To examine the association between smoking and general health
   as measured by the Short-Fonn Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire.
   Methods. Data derived are from three cross-sectional surveys conducted
   in 2000, 2001 and 2002. Respondents to the postal surveys were
   middle-aged employees of the City of Helsinki (1799 men and 7171 women,
   response rate 67\%). Smoking status was divided into current heavy and
   moderate smokers, ex-smokers and never smokers. Health status was
   measured by the eight SF-36 subscales and the physical and mental
   component summaries.
   Results. On the physical subscales, current smokers reported poorer
   health than non-smokers on general health and physical functioning in
   men. On the mental subscales, current smokers had consistently poorer
   health than non-smokers. However, often only heavy smokers differed from
   non-smokers. No differences were found between ex-smokers and never
   smokers on any subscale or the component summades of the SF-36.
   Conclusions. Differences between smoking categories were found on some
   physical and all mental subscales of the SF-36. The differences were
   slightly larger among men. As heavy smokers more often report
   limitations with daily activities as well as loss of well-being, these
   impairments potentially provide valuable incentives for non-smoking to
   be used in health education messages and interventions. (c) 2005

Title = {{Barriers and incentives to orphan care in a time of AIDS and economic
   crisis: a cross-sectional survey of caregivers in rural Zimbabwe}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Africa is in an orphan-care crisis. In Zimbabwe, where
   one-fourth of adults are HIV-positive and one-fifth of children are
   orphans, AIDS and economic decline are straining society's ability to
   care for orphans within their extended families. Lack of stable care is
   putting thousands of children at heightened risk of malnourishment,
   emotional underdevelopment, illiteracy, poverty, sexual exploitation,
   and HIV infection, endangering the future health of the society they are
   expected to sustain.
   Methods: To explore barriers and possible incentives to orphan care, a
   quantitative cross-sectional survey in rural eastern Zimbabwe asked 371
   adults caring for children, including 212 caring for double orphans,
   about their well-being, needs, resources, and perceptions and
   experiences of orphan care.
   Results: Survey responses indicate that: 1) foster caregivers are
   disproportionately female, older, poor, and without a spouse; 2) 98\% of
   non-foster caregivers are willing to foster orphans, many from outside
   their kinship network; 3) poverty is the primary barrier to fostering;
   4) financial, physical, and emotional stress levels are high among
   current and potential fosterers; 5) financial need may be greatest in
   single-orphan AIDS-impoverished households; and 6) struggling families
   lack external support.
   Conclusion: Incentives for sustainable orphan care should focus on
   financial assistance, starting with free schooling, and development of
   community mechanisms to identify and support children in need, to
   evaluate and strengthen families' capacity to provide orphan care, and
   to initiate and support placement outside the family when necessary.}},

Abstract = {{Background Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among long-term
   survivors of coronary artery bypass surgery is an important outcome that
   has been little studied at the population level.
   Methods A postal survey was conducted in 1999 to 2000 in patients 6 to
   20 years after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery in
   Western-Australia. A random stratified sample of 2500 was drawn from
   8910 patients who had their first CABG surgery in 1980 to 1993.
   Health-related quality of life was measured with Short Form 36 and
   EuroQol visual analogue scale.
   Results Response was 82\% (n = 2061). Health-related quality of life
   declined with age and was similar for men and women, although scores for
   women were worse for physical functioning. Compared with Australian
   population norms, the age- and sex-standardized scores of survivors of
   CABG were generally worse, mainly in the physical domain. Reported
   angina at the time of follow-up (33\%), symptoms of heart failure
   equivalent to New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes II to IV (34\%),
   and comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension were associated with
   poorer HRQOL. For both men and women without angina or heart failure at
   follow-up, HRQOL was no different from that of the general population.
   Conclusion Overall, the quality of life among long-term survivors of
   CABG is worse than that of the general population, the difference being
   mainly attributable to recurrent symptoms and comorbidities. Quality of
   life for those without angina or heart failure at follow-up was
   equivalent to the population norms, providing an incentive to maximize
   efforts to abolish angina and ameliorate heart failure symptoms.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Little information is available nationally about critical
   care units and nurses. What is known about nurses in hospitals is
   generally not broken down among all the specialties.
   OBJECTIVES To describe issues of work force, compensation, and care
   specific to critical care units and nurses who work in them.
   METHODS The American Association of Critical-Care Nurses conducted a
   survey of randomly, selected facilities with critical care units in the
   United States. Facilities were solicited via e-mail to respond to a
   survey on the World Wide Web and provide information on operations,
   evaluations, nursing staff reimbursement and incentives, staffing, and
   quality indicators. Responding facilities also provided contact
   information for units in the facilities. Those units were surveyed about
   operations, acuity systems, staffing, policies on visitation and
   end-of-life care, administrative structure, documentation,
   certification, professional advancement, vancancy/floating, staff
   satisfaction, orientation, association membership, wages, advanced
   practice nursing, and quality indicators.
   RESULTS The initial response rate (120 of 658 eligible facilities) was
   18.2\%, and 300 of 576 solicited units nominated by the facilities
   responded, yielding a 52.1\% response rate for the second phase.
   CONCLUSIONS These survey data define the scope and intensity of services
   offered and provide more specific figures about staffing issues and unit
   practices than has been accessible before. Healthcare providers may use
   this information for benchmarking purposes, especially for instances in
   which the tables provide data for each particular ope of critical care

Title = {{A survey on patient educational needs in irritable bowel syndrome and

Abstract = {{Background: The educational needs of patients with irritable bowel
   syndrome (IBS) are poorly understood and rarely studied.
   Aim: To determine the educational needs of IBS patients, regarding
   content, presentation format, and expectations from healthcare
   providers.
   Methods: Fifteen functional GI clinic patients were asked open-ended
   questions to generate items for a questionnaire addressing the study
   aim. A total of 104 IBS patients received this questionnaire by mail (42
   had declined to participate in a prior IBS study). To assess the
   frequency of endorsements and importance (on a scale of 1-3) of the
   items, an index was calculated (frequency of endorsements X mean rating
   per item, first priority scored 3, third priority scored 1). A higher
   index indicated greater endorsement based on frequency and rating of
   response.
   Results: A total of 29 (28\%) subjects (22 willing, 7 unwilling to
   participate previously in questionnaire research) completed the
   questionnaire (mean age, 42.6 years; SD, 14.2 years; 19 female, 10
   male). The overall low response rate is likely related to the population
   studied; 40.4\% of our study subjects have declined participation in
   prior research. The response rate of those who have previously agreed to
   participate was 36\%. The typical response profile included: interest in
   learning disease management (index = 1.4) and preference for information
   presented in person by an M.D. (2.4). Choice of presentation media
   included magazines (1.9), television (1.5), and Web sites (1.2).
   Doctors' qualities ranked high related to competency (0.8), allocation
   of sufficient time (0.7), and listening skills (0.4). Preferred
   incentives for research participation included a thank you note (0.4),
   summary of trial results (0.3), and monetary incentives (0.6).
   Conclusions: This qualitative study will provide pilot data for a
   national survey on the educational needs of IBS patients, for use in
   developing effective patient-centered, educational programs.}},

Journal = {{PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY}},

Volume = {{70}},
Number = {{5, SI}},
Pages = {{720-736}},
Abstract = {{While nonresponse rates in household surveys are increasing in most
   industrialized nations, the increasing rates do not always produce
   nonresponse bias in survey estimates. The linkage between nonresponse
   rates and nonresponse bias arises from the presence of a covariance
   between response propensity and the survey variables of interest. To
   understand the covariance term, researchers must think about the common
   influences on response propensity and the survey variable. Three
   variables appear to be especially relevant in this regard: interest in
   the survey topic, reactions to the survey sponsor, and the use of
   incentives. A set of randomized experiments tests whether those likely
   to be interested in the stated survey topic participate at higher rates
   and whether nonresponse bias on estimates involving variables central to
   the survey topic is affected by this. The experiments also test whether
   incentives disproportionately increase the participation of those less
   interested in the topic. The experiments show mixed results in support
   of these key hypotheses.}},

   Brussels, Belgium, have developed a framework, a standard, and
   certification procedures for the management of service quality. Based on
   Averous's service quality cycle, this framework incorporates both
   customer satisfaction and performance evaluation with service standards
   and service indicators that are customer oriented yet objectively
   measurable. The develops ment of this quality movement is documented,
   and its implementation in Brussels is used as a case study. There, the
   management contract provides financial incentives based on the
   percentage of passengers, served by lines whose service quality has been
   certified, and the organization chart includes several managers
   responsible for service quality. The process of defining service targets
   is described with a framework that emphasizes extreme values and
   specification of both a base level and a level of unacceptability that
   demands immediate action. Special attention is given to two methods of
   performance measurement: automatic processing of archived automatic
   vehicle location data and ``mystery shopper{''} surveys. Improvements,
   organizational changes, and new programs developed in response to the

Abstract = {{Whether the number of organs available for transplant would be
   positively or negatively affected by providing benefits to families of
   organ donors has been debated by policymakers, ethicists and the
   transplant community at large. We designed a telephone survey to measure
   public opinion regarding the use of benefits in general and of five
   types in particular: funeral benefits, charitable contributions,
   travel/lodging expenses, direct payments and medical expenses. Of the
   971 adults who completed the survey (response rate = 69\%), all were
   from Pennsylvania households, 45.6\% were registered organ donors, and
   51.7\% were nonwhite. Although 59\% of respondents favored the general
   idea of incentives, support for specific incentives ranged from 53\%
   (direct payment) to 84\% (medical expenses). Among those registered as
   donors, more nonwhites than whites supported funeral benefits (88\% vs.
   81\%; p = 0.038), direct payment (63\% vs. 41\%; p < 0.001) and medical
   expenses (92\% vs. 84\%; p = 0.013). Among those not registered as
   donors, more nonwhites supported direct payment (64\% vs. 46\%; p =
   0.001). Most respondents believed that benefits would not influence
   their own behavior concerning donation but would influence the behavior
   of others. While benefits appear to be favored, their true impact can
   only be assessed through pilot programs.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Achieving acceptable response rates from health care
   providers via postal questionnaires is an ongoing challenge. The use of
   monetary incentives is one of the most effective strategies for
   increasing response rates. However, the effect and cost of such an
   incentive on retail pharmacists' response rates has not been well
   studied.
   Methods: A sample of 700 pharmacies was selected at random from the
   electronic Yellow Pages in NSW Australia and mailed a brief survey
   regarding pharmacotherapies and advice for smoking cessation. Half of
   the sample was randomly allocated to receive an offer of an US\$14 gift
   voucher.
   Results: The response rates were 65.9\% for the voucher group and 53.5\%
   for the no-voucher group. The odds of response from the voucher group
   was 1.68 (95\%CI = 1.23, 2.30) times greater than for the no-voucher
   group. The cost per additional respondent was US\$67.95. The incentive
   also reduced follow up costs by 10\%.
   Conclusions: A moderately sized monetary incentive is able to achieve a
   significant increase in response rates for retail pharmacists, thereby

Abstract = {{Purpose: Barriers to simulation-based education in postgraduate and
   continuing education for anesthesiologists have not been well studied.
   We hypothesized that the level of training may influence attitudes
   towards simulation-based education and impact on the use of simulation.
   This study investigated this issue at the University of Toronto which
   possesses two sites equipped with high-fidelity patient simulators.
   Methods: A 40-question survey of experiences, perceptions, motivations
   and perceived barriers to simulation-based education, was distributed to
   154 anesthesiologists attending a departmental conference. Data were
   analyzed using descriptive statistics and associations between responses
   were assessed using either the Chi-Square statistic or a one-way
   analysis of variance.
   Results: The rate of response was 58\%. Residents had experienced
   simulation-based education (96\%) more often than staff (58\%) and
   fellows (36\%), (P < 0.001 respectively). Residents had also attended
   more simulation sessions than staff and fellows (mean 2.8 vs 1.05 and
   1.04, P < 0.001 respectively). Residents and fellows found
   simulation-based education more relevant for their training than staff
   (88\% vs 65\%, P < 0.05). Eighty-one percent of the respondents
   identified at least one significant barrier that prevents or limits them
   from attending simulator sessions. Staff anesthesiologists perceived
   multiple barriers and identified `time' and `financial issues' as
   significant barriers.
   Conclusion: Anesthesiologists' level of training influences their
   attitudes towards and their perceptions of simulation-based education.
   This survey has identified perceived barriers that may limit a wider
   utilization of simulation. These results may be used to implement
   targeted actions such as course design, incentives, and information
   strategies, which could improve access and future use of simulation.}},

   to assess consumer-preferred survey design features and incentives. To
   test hypotheses, we conducted the following trial. Out of 10,733 total
   participants in a Kansas Medicaid managed care plan, 3,685 eligible for
   CAHPS were unduplicated by household. After randomization of the 968
   households with valid addresses to one of three groups, a controlled
   trial was conducted to assess response rates to CAHPS survey formats and
   incentives. Response rates were 35\% for a standard mailing, 44\% for a
   user-friendly low-literacy mailing, and 64\% for a user-friendly
   low-literacy mailing with a \$10 contingent incentive. Both experimental
   arms significantly improved response compared with the control; the
   response rate of the mailing group with the incentive was higher than
   the response rate of the group receiving that mailing without any
   incentive (p < 0.0001). Using consumer-based preferences significantly
   increased response rates to this Medicaid satisfaction survey. Raising
   CAHPS response rates may increase validity of Medicaid consumer

Abstract = {{Background. Adequate access to dental care for young
   children-particularly those from low-income families-is a public
   concern. The authors conducted a survey of Ohio dental care providers to
   examine factors influencing their willingness to care for these
   children.
   Methods. Random samples of Ohio general practitioner (GPs) dentists and
   pediatric dentists (PDs) and all Ohio safety-net dental clinics
   completed a mail survey regarding treatment of children aged 0 through 5
   years. The authors categorized responses by provider type and further
   analyzed GPs' responses by years since graduation and geographic
   character.
   Results. Few Ohio GPs (8 percent) recommended a first dental visit by 1
   year of age. While 91 percent of GPs treated children aged 3 through 5
   years, only 34 percent treated children aged 0 through 2 years, most
   often for emergency visits or examinations. Only 7 percent of all GPs
   and 29 percent of PDs accepted patients enrolled in Medicaid without
   limitations.
   Conclusions. Children's being young (0-2 years of age) and having
   Medicaid as a payment source made GPs substantially less likely to treat
   them. Children's being enrolled in Head Start made GPs somewhat more
   likely to treat them.
   Practice Implications. New strategies for ensuring dental care access
   for young children from low-income families are necessary. Such
   strategies may take the form of interpeer advocacy, education, practice
   incentives or creation of coordinated GP and PD teams.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Disease registries are lists of patients with a particular
   chronic illness. including clinical information, to improve the care of
   individuals and populations. The objective of this study was to
   determine the prevalence of disease registries in physician
   organizations and the extent to which they are used to improve care.
   DESIGN., A cross-sectional national telephone survey with a response
   rate of 70\%.
   SETTING: All physician organizations in the United States with 20
   physicians or more.
   PARTICIPANTS: Chief executive officers, presidents, or medical directors
   of 1040 physician organizations.
   INTERVENTIONS: None.
   MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Forty-seven percent of organizations
   reported having a registry for at least I chronic illness, with diabetes
   registries being the most common. Half (51\%) of the registries were not
   linked to clinical data. Organizations with at least I registry were
   more likely to have implemented other chronic care improvements (P
   <.0001). Factors associated with the presence of registries in physician
   organizations include external incentives for quality and extent of
   information technology capabilities.
   CONCLUSIONS: Disease registries are not utilized by half of physician
   organizations. This finding is disturbing because registries have the
   potential to catalyze needed improvement in chronic care management.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: This paper reports recommendations for improving public
   health nursing (PHN) undergraduate, graduate, and continuing education
   (CE) made by staff-level public health nurses working in local health
   departments (LHDs). Implications for academia and practice are
   discussed.
   Design: A cross-sectional written survey was used to collect data from
   424 public health nurses in 76 LHDs in Wisconsin (68\% response rate) in
   2003. Recommendations for improving undergraduate, graduate, and CE were
   made through responses to open-ended survey questions. Content analysis

   Results: Major themes emerging from the recommendations for
   undergraduate education included the need for more clinical public
   health experiences and population-focused practice content. Graduate
   education improvement recommendations included addressing access
   barriers and increasing organizational incentives. Improved access and
   more public health content were the major recommendations for improving

Abstract = {{We carried out an experiment that compared telephone and Web versions of
   a questionnaire that assessed attitudes toward science and knowledge of
   basic scientific facts. Members of a random digit dial (RDD) sample were
   initially contacted by telephone and answered a few screening questions,
   including one that asked whether they had-Internet access. Those with
   Internet access were randomly assigned to complete either a Web version
   of the questionnaire or a computer-assisted telephone interview. There
   were four main findings. First, although we offered cases assigned to
   the Web survey a larger incentive, fewer of them completed the online
   questionnaire; almost all those who were assigned to the telephone
   condition completed the interview. The two samples of Web users
   nonetheless had similar demographic characteristics. Second, the Web
   survey produced less item nonresponse than the telephone survey. The Web
   questionnaire prompted respondents- when they left an item blank,
   whereas the telephone interviewers accepted ``no opinion{''} answers
   without probing them. Third, Web respondents gave less differentiated
   answers to batteries of attitude items than their telephone
   counterparts. The Web questionnaire presented these items in a grid that
   may have made their similarity more salient.
   Finally, Web respondents took longer to complete the knowledge items,
   particularly those requiring open-ended answers, than the telephone
   respondents, and Web respondents answered a higher percentage of them
   correctly. These differences between Web and telephone surveys probably
   reflect both inherent differences between the two modes and incidental
   features of our implementation of the survey. The mode differences also
   vary by item type and by respondent age.}},

   pencil versus 24\% without one (p = 0.02). This 15-19 percentage point
   increase for mailing 2 translated to a 5-6 percentage point increase
   after the two mailings combined. In a simulated study of three mailings
   based on these studies, the overall response rate increased by 4
   percentage points at no added cost through inclusion of a pencil in the
   second mailing. The additional cost of the pencil was compensated for by
   the reduced number of nonrespondents sent packets at the third mailing.
   This study supports including a study-logo pen or pencil in a second
   questionnaire mailing to nonrespondents as a cost-effective method of
   increasing response rates.}},

Abstract = {{Theory and evidence suggests that respondents are likely to overreport
   voter turnout in election surveys because they have a strong incentive
   to offer a socially desirable response. We suggest that contextual
   influences may affect the socially desirable bias, leading to variance
   in the rate of over-reporting across countries. This leads us to
   hypothesize that nonvoters will be more likely to overreport voting in
   elections that have high turnout. We rely on validated turnout data to
   measure overreporting in five countries which vary a great deal in
   turnout: Britain, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and the United States. We
   find that in national settings with higher levels of participation, the
   tendency to overreport turnout may be greater than in settings where low
   participation is the norm.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose To test the effect of a \$AU 2 scratch lottery ticket on
   response rates to a national mailed questionnaire of Australian general
   practitioners (GPs) and medical specialists.
   Methods A randomized controlled trial Was conducted and the incentive
   sent to half of the participants with the first mailing. A single
   follow-up mailing without incentive was sent to all non-respondents.
   Survey respondents were then informed of the research question regarding
   incentives and allowed to withdraw their study data. Differences in
   response rates between doctors receiving and not receiving the
   incentive, and between respondents and non-respondents, were examined.
   Results The overall response rate was 47\% (443 respondents). Twenty-two
   respondents (5\%) withdrew their data after being informed of the
   research question. Of the remaining 421 respondents, 233 had received
   the incentive (response rate 49.7\%) and 188 had not (40.1\%, p =
   0.0032). The absolute increase in response rate with the incentive
   (9.6\%, 95\%CI 3.2, 15.9) was quantitatively similar in effect to the
   reminder mailing (11.8\%). The incentive had a larger effect among the
   GP sample compared with specialists (13.4 vs. 5.9\%), although the
   difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.20). There were no
   systematic differences in demographic characteristics between
   respondents and non-respondents.
   Conclusions Increased response rates associated with a small incentive
   may reduce the need for a second mailed reminder, but strong views about
   the use of incentives may negatively influence the participation of some
   practitioners. While the overall response rate was low, there was no
   evidence of bias in our sample. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \& Sons,

   Design: Postal survey sent to a random sample of GPs.
   Participants and setting: 315 GPs in five Divisions of General Practice
   in metropolitan Sydney, surveyed sequentially between 1 October 2002 and
   31 May 2003.
   Outcome measures: Awareness and use of the Asthma 3+ Visit Plan; GP and
   practice factors associated with use of the plan; and GP views on
   barriers and facilitators to implementing the plan.
   Results: The response rate was 55.7\%, and 72.1\% of participants were
   male; participants' mean age was 50.5 years. Most GPs (91.2\%) were
   aware of the plan and and 44.9\% had used it. GP and practice factors
   associated with use of the plan were use of the six-step Australian
   Asthma Management Plan, confidence in aspects of asthma care, practice
   accreditation, sign-up for asthma incentives, and computerisation. Major
   barriers to implementating the plan were workload/paperwork and
   administrative complexities. Patient factors that influenced completion
   of the plan were their concept of the severity of their asthma,
   compliance with follow-up, and patient attitudes towards asthma care.
   Conclusion: The perceived workload and administrative complexity of the
   asthma incentives are barriers to uptake. Factors relating to the
   illness rather than social factors are seen as the most important
   influences on completion of the plan by patients.}},

Abstract = {{In this field investigation, a new approach for evaluating energy
   conservation and awareness programs within residential consumers is
   presented and discussed. It is based on expert computer knowledge-based
   systems and fuzzy set analyses. Computer-programmed surveys were carried
   out on a random sample of energy users in Jordan, such as students,
   housewives and educated and uneducated citizens, before and after they
   received a simple energy educational material. The fuzzy set logic
   technique enabled to condense large data into a small set of variable
   rules. Relative weights were given for each response and a cumulative
   grade was estimated. This in turn made the employed expert system
   effective in evaluating energy conservation programs. The follow-up
   survey revealed that a reasonable rise, of about 15\%, of energy related
   knowledge was achieved, as compared to the initial survey. Fuzzy set
   analyses suggest that some fluctuations in the relative rise of public
   awareness programs may be attributed to insufficient knowledge. Thus,
   through public awareness and demonstration programs as well as
   incentives, such as financial assistance and technical aid to encourage
   energy end-users, in all sectors, to employ the latest technologies and
   more energy-efficient equipment, final energy demand can be reduced or
   controlled. Hence, energy efficiency should be incorporated as a corner
   stone of the national energy policy. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   Methods A postal survey was sent to all physicians in the Irish Medical
   Directory in November 2003. Nine questions were asked to gauge attitudes
   to peer review as a CA tool. The returned questionnaires were collated

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose: The introduction of the case-based payment
   system by the Bureau of National Health Insurance resulted in greatly
   increased pressure on the health care industry in Taiwan. This study
   examined the relationship between the coping strategies adopted and the
   results attained by accredited teaching hospitals and non-teaching
   regional hospitals when responding to this regulatory change.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted using a structured
   questionnaire to assess the hospitals' characteristics, and coping
   strategies at the technical, managerial and institutional levels in
   response to the case-based payment system, and to compare these
   strategies with self-evaluation of the effectiveness of these
   strategies. The questionnaire was sent in early October 2000 to the
   superintendents of the 129 hospitals that were accredited at the medical
   center, regional hospital, and district teaching hospital levels in the
   year 2000. Factor analysis was applied to group the strategies into
   categories and stepwise regression analysis was used to explore the
   relationship between the reported coping strategies adopted and their
   effectiveness as evaluated by participants.
   Results: Among the selected hospitals, 89 responded with complete data,
   a 69\% response rate. The following 7 factors were extracted from 30
   coping strategies: information and financial analysis; service shifting
   and unbundling; service integration and quality improvement; service
   specialization and strengthening; education and training; financial
   incentives; and claim submission skill. After adjusting for
   accreditation level or ownership status, 2 main findings were noted.
   First, hospitals that implemented financial incentives strategies such
   as holding physicians responsible for all or part of the shortfall
   between actual claim submissions and actual reimbursements, and reducing
   or withholding payment to physicians beyond the standard length of stay,
   tended to increase medical revenue (odds ratio, 1.21). Second, hospitals
   that implemented service integration and quality improvement strategies,
   such as implementing a discharge plan, implementing clinical pathways
   and periodic review of quality indicators, attained higher patient
   satisfaction rate (odds ratio, 1.40).
   Conclusions: This study suggests that hospitals confronting the
   implementation of a case based-payment system may benefit by adopting
   financial incentives strategies and by efforts to improve service
   integration and quality.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Mailed surveys are widely used to collect epidemiologic and
   health service data. Given that nonresponse can threaten the validity of
   surveys, modest incentives are often used to increase response rates. A
   study was undertaken among childhood cancer survivors and their parents
   to determine if response rate to a mailed survey differed with provision
   of immediate versus delayed incentives.
   Design: A self-administered survey designed to ascertain health
   behaviors was mailed to 397 childhood cancer survivors (and their
   parents if the survivor was \&LT; 18 years of age). Subjects were
   randomized into two groups based on gender, age, race, and cancer type.
   One group received a \$10 incentive with their blank survey
   (unconditional incentive), whereas the other group received the
   incentive upon receipt of their completed survey (conditional
   incentive). If children were minors, both the parent and the child
   received incentives.
   Results: No significant differences in response rates were observed with
   respect to gender, age, race, or cancer type. However, significant
   differences in response rates were observed between incentive groups,
   with unconditional incentives yielding significantly higher response
   rates than conditional incentives for child survivors who were \&GE; 18

   Conclusions: The provision of an immediate incentive generated
   significantly higher response rates to this mailed health survey among
   childhood cancer survivors and their parents. Given that survey studies
   are commonly conducted across various pediatric populations, these
   findings may help inform the design of future pediatric survey research.}},

   Objective: To investigate differences in response rates to a mailed

Abstract = {{Question under study: Due to low response rates mail surveys have been
   called into question as research instruments in general practice. The
   most effective actions to reduce non-response, such as financial
   incentives and complex follow-up procedures, are costly. We investigated
   whether a good response rate is achievable with a less costly survey
   design, and examined the effect of increased response rates due to
   repeated follow-ups on survey results.
   Methods: In a mail survey on drug interactions among 2000 general
   practitioners in south-west Germany, most well-known criteria
   influencing response rates were met except financial incentives. A four
   stage design with two reminders was applied and the time course of
   response was recorded.
   Results after both reminders were calculated with 95\% confidence
   intervals and compared with initial results using the
   Jonckheere-Terpstra test with correction for multiple testing. A p <
   0.01 was considered significant. Results: Although we did not provide
   financial incentives we achieved a response rate of 60.8\% with our
   survey design. The first reminder with a simple postcard was almost
   three times less effective than the second reminder including another
   copy of the questionnaire. For only two survey questions, the answers of
   late respondents differed significantly from those of initial
   respondents (p < 0.01). For these two questions, cumulative results
   after both reminders never differed from initial results by more than
   3.7\%.
   Conclusion: Even if financial incentives are not affordable, good
   response rates can be obtained among general practitioners when surveys
   are meticulously planned and implemented. Potential non-response bias
   introduced by those general practitioners who do not answer despite
   numerous reminders, cannot be tested by comparing early and late
   respondents. Therefore, we suggest that the impact of reminders on
   survey results should be assessed early. If no bias can be detected one
   further reminder with a copy of the questionnaire might result in
   estimates very similar to those after numerous reminders.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: We sought to evaluate the effect of pairing a mixed-mode
   mail and telephone methodology with a prepaid \$2.00 cash incentive on
   response rates in a survey of Medicaid enrollees stratified by race and
   ethnicity.
   Research Design: Sampling was conducted in 2 stages. The first stage
   consisted of a simple random sample (SRS) of Medicaid enrollees. In the
   second stage, American Indian, African American, Latino, Hmong, and
   Somali enrollees were randomly sampled. A total of 8412 enrollees were
   assigned randomly to receive a mail survey with no incentive or a \$2.00
   bill.
   Results: The response rate within the SRS after the mail portion was
   54\% in the incentive group and 45\% in the nonincentive group. Response
   rates increased considerably with telephone follow-ups. The incentive
   SRS response rate increased to 69\%, and the nonincentive response rate
   increased to 64\%. Differences between incentive conditions are more
   pronounced after the first mailing (P < 0.01); almost all differences
   remained significant (P < 0.05) after the completion of the mail mode.
   The inclusion of the \$2.00 incentive had similar effects on response
   rates and cost across the different racial and ethnic strata, except for
   Latino enrollees.
   Conclusions: A mixed-mode mail and telephone methodology is effective
   for increasing response rates in a Medicaid population overall and
   within different racial and ethnic groupings. The effectiveness of this
   strategy can be enhanced, in terms of response rate and cost, by
   including a \$2.00 prepaid incentive.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Recruitment of African Americans into health research studies
   is a major challenge. This report describes a study of different methods
   and strategies to recruit African Americans into a population-based
   assessment of cancer behavioral risk factors.
   Methods: African Americans ages 18 to 70 years in North Carolina (n =
   5,000) were randomly selected from the Department of Motor Vehicle
   rosters and assigned at random to one of five different recruitment
   strategies based on variations of approach letters (generic versus
   culturally sensitive) and inclusion, exclusion, or promise of a small
   incentive. Prospective participants were sent an 11-page questionnaire
   by mail but could complete it by telephone or Internet as well as by
   mail.
   Results: The overall response rate was 17.5\% (747 completed surveys of
   4,276 delivered): 655, 84, and 8 by mail, Internet, and telephone,
   respectively. Among eligible respondents, response was significantly
   higher for incentive-based than nonincentive strategies; 23.9\% for the
   generic letter plus incentive compared with 15.8\% for the generic
   letter only (P < 0.001). The culturally sensitive letter had little
   effect on participation (15.8\% for both the generic and culturally
   sensitive letters). The mean age of eligible respondents was 43.9 years,
   41\% were male, 37\% were college graduates, and 75\% were
   overweight/obese. There were no differences in respondent
   characteristics by assigned recruitment strategy.
   Conclusions: Incentive-based strategies yielded the highest survey
   responses, whereas a culturally sensitive letter did not appreciably
   increase participation among African Americans in North Carolina. This
   study adds to what is known about culturally sensitive recruitment
   strategies for African Americans and challenges their usefulness in
   survey-based studies.}},

Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{This study examined why people accepted a demanding rule in a recycling
   system that was newly introduced in Nagoya City. We focused on two
   social psychological topics: social dilemmas and fairness. While the new
   system succeeded in reducing waste, it imposed a burden on citizens
   without providing incentives and sanctions. In a research survey, 1442
   responses from a sample of 3000 (48\% response rate) were obtained using
   a stratified sampling method. The results showed that the new recycling
   system was approved despite the demands placed on citizens, with a
   preference for more strict rules such as penalties and surveillance for
   noncompliance. The main determinants of approval of the new recycling
   system were social benefit and procedural fairness, whereas the main
   determinant of preference for strict rules was outcome fairness. We
   argue that (a) social benefit should be emphasized to facilitate
   cooperative behavior in a social dilemma situation and (b) the
   government should ensure sufficient discussion with citizens and
   acknowledgment of their opinions.}},

Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{5-26}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Features of the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program and the
   social security retirement system interact to create incentives for
   prospective participants in the aged portion of SSI to withdraw from the
   labor force and make an early old age insurance (CAI) claim under social
   security. This paper takes a first close look at this SSI-OAI
   interaction. We first review the. incentives to take early CAI posed by
   SSI rules in a basic theoretical framework. The impact of SSI rules on
   the financial cost of delaying the initial OAI claim is quantified using
   the earnings profiles of actual SSI recipients from Social Security
   Administration records. We then examine whether patterns Of first SSI
   claims and early OAI claims of SSI-aged participants are consistent with
   the incentives identified. Finally, regression tests of behavior
   consistent with the predictions of the theory are implemented. The
   evidence from these various approaches generally points to behavior that
   makes the SSI-OAI interaction plausible and potentially important, and
   that is consistent with predicted responses to the incentives for early
   retirement in social security created by the interactions of SSI and
   OAI. Throughout, the analyses are enhanced by access to Social Security
   Administration records that have been matched to individuals in the
   Surveys of Income and Program Participation.}},

Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{9-16}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: (a) To report on response rate and nonresponse bias of a
   questionnaire survey of dentists. (b) To make recommendations for future
   questionnaire survey research in dentistry. Methods: A questionnaire was
   mailed to a stratified systematic sample of 908 Australian dentists. The
   strategy included three mailings, a final telephonic contact, university
   stationery, paid reply envelopes and personalized correspondence.
   Nonresponse bias was assessed by comparing responses to a simple
   `yes/no' question from each contact (late responders), and by comparing
   demographic information (nonresponders). Results: The response rate
   achieved was 87\% and there was no evidence of nonresponse bias based on
   practice location or year of graduation. The cumulative proportions of
   `yes/no' responses essentially remained constant after each contact, but
   significantly more late responders answered in the negative to the test
   question than did early responders. The telephonic contact aided in the
   identification of nonparticipants and ineligible units. Conclusions: The
   current survey indicates that differences in data between early and
   nonresponders can occur despite there being no demographic differences.
   Therefore, assessment of nonresponse bias based on demographic data
   alone would seem to be insufficient. Questionnaire survey research must
   first be based on sound sampling techniques, and then on achieving as
   high a response rate as possible using the many incentives available.}},

Abstract = {{Background/objectives: The key to HIV/STI control is community-wide
   intervention (CWI) which depends heavily on continuous monitoring and
   evaluation. Unfortunately, comprehensive CWI assessment methodology and
   reports are generally lacking. This study developed, applied, and
   evaluated a rapid tool for assessing CWI in China.
   Methods: A total of 120 county level respondents in charge of
   county-wide responses to HIV/STI thoughout China were selected randomly
   and surveyed using a structured inventory consisting of three tiers of
   indicators developed via consensus group techniques. The respondents
   were asked to rate each of the indicators against a five grade ( 1 - 5)
   scale. 30 pairs of the same staff from within Anhui Province were
   surveyed to gauge inter-rater reliability.
   Results: Response rate for the nationwide survey was 85\% and for
   inter-rater reliability survey, 90\%. Correlation coefficients between
   the inter-rater ratings ranged from 0.68 to 0.95. The overall average
   rating of CWI in China was 2.85. Average ratings for the six first tier
   indicators, organisation and policy development, goals and objectives
   setting, project and action planning, resource exploitation, project and
   task implementation, and CWI evaluation were 2.87, 2.83, 2.67, 2.77,
   3.26, and 2.71 respectively. Ratings derived for the 24 second tier
   indicators ranged from 2.1 to 3.86; while for the 96 third tier
   indicators, 1.90 to 4.40
   Conclusions: The instrument developed proved to be reliable, useful, and
   easily applicable in common communities. Application of it in China
   revealed that a large gap exists between desired and actual CWI, and
   areas meriting particular attention include policy and incentives
   development, intervention planning and evaluation, and fund raising and

Pages = {{443-452}},
Abstract = {{Background The Correction of Myopia Evaluation Trial (COMET), a
   randomized, multicenter clinical trial of myopia progression in
   children, had an exceptionally high retention rate of 98.5\% (462/469)
   at three years of follow-up. The present investigation was designed to
   evaluate and compare the reasons for COMET's high retention rate
   according to participating families and clinical center staff.
   Methods Families (n = 411) and staff (n = 35) completed a confidential
   19-item questionnaire by indicating families' levels of preference for
   each item, and rating its importance in keeping families in the study.
   The questionnaire evaluated study features in four categories: staff
   characteristics, operational aspects, specific study elements, and
   incentives.
   Results Results showed that most families viewed the study very
   favorably. Features that appealed to 90\% or more families and promoted
   continued study participation included staff attributes such as
   friendliness, responsiveness and encouragement, and aspects pertaining
   to standard of care such as completeness of eye exam, quality of eye
   care and free eyeglasses. Compared to families, staff tended to
   underestimate the importance of the following features for retention:
   seeing the same staff at each visit, appointment reminders, center
   location, newsletters, commitment to the study, being part of a
   nationwide study, length of the study, association with a college of
   optometry, completeness of eye exam, and eye drops (p < 0.05 by
   chi-square analyses). However, staff responses also revealed less
   preferred components of the study protocol (e.g., eye drops), to which
   families might have been reluctant to respond unfavorably.
   Conclusions Our findings highlight the importance of intangible factors
   such as staff attributes and participants' study commitment in
   maintaining high retention rates, and the usefulness of surveying both
   families and staff.}},

Abstract = {{The Commute Atlanta program is an instrumented vehicle research program
   funded by the FHWA Value Pricing Program and the Georgia Department of
   Transportation. A major objective for the multiyear program is to assess
   the effects of converting fixed automotive costs into variable driving
   costs. The main research hypothesis is that given a per mile pricing
   system, participants will modify their driving patterns in an effort to
   reduce their total costs, pocketing the savings. The Commute Atlanta
   project includes the parallel collection of instrumented vehicle data,
   household sociodemographic surveys, 2-day travel diaries, and employer
   commute options surveys. The research team will monitor the changes in
   driving patterns and will use statistical analyses or household
   characteristics, vehicle travel, and relevant employer survey data to
   examine the relationships between the incentives offered and subsequent
   travel behavior changes. This paper focuses on the recruitment methods
   and travel diary response rates for the 2-day diary surveys conducted in
   February and March 2004. As in other instrumented vehicle studies,
   researchers collected data that allow the comparison of reported diary
   travel with monitored vehicle travel. However, this paper focuses on a
   new type of comparison. Because the households had been recruited into
   the study 8 months before the diary study and their vehicles were
   transmitting activity data, the research team could examine whether
   there were differences in household vehicle activity between that 77\%
   of households that completed the diary data collection and the 23\% that
   did not. The differences were significant at both the high and low ends
   of the travel-reporting spectrum and may have some major implications
   for evolving household travel survey methods.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Low response rates to surveys are a problem in general

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{97}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1782-1789}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Food, water, and worker protection regulations have driven availability,
   and loss, of pesticides for use in pest management programs. In
   response, public-supported research and extension projects have targeted
   investigation and demonstration of reduced-risk integrated pest
   management (IPM) techniques, But these new techniques often result in
   higher financial burden to the grower, which is counter to the IPM
   principle that economic competitiveness is critical to have IPM adopted.
   As authorized by the 2002 Farm Bill and administered by the U.S.
   Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service
   (NRCS), conservation programs exist for delivering public-supported
   financial incentives to growers to increase environmental stewardship on
   lands in production. NRCS conservation programs are described, and the
   case for providing financial incentives to growers for implementing IPM
   is presented. We also explored the opportunity and challenge to use one
   key program, the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), to aid
   grower adoption of IPM. The EQIP fund distribution to growers from 1997
   to 2002 during the last Far m Bill cycle totaled approximate to\$1.05
   billion with a portion of funds supporting an NRCS-designed pest
   management practice. The average percentage of allocation of EQIP funds
   to this pest management practice among states was 0.77 +/- 0.009\% (mean
   +/- SD). Using Michigan as an example, vegetable and fruit grower
   recognition of the program's use to implement IPM was modest (25\% of
   growers surveyed), and their recognition of its use in aiding
   implementation of IPM was improved after educational efforts (74\%).
   Proposals designed to enhance program usefulness in implementing IPM
   were delivered through the NRCS advisory process in Michigan.
   Modifications for using the NRCS pest management practice to address
   resource concerns were adopted, incentive rates for pest management were
   adjusted, and an expanded incentive structure for IPM technique adoption
   was tabled for future consideration. The case is strong for using
   public-supported financial incentives offered by the EQIP to aid grower
   adoption of IPM as a means to address resource concerns, but current use
   of the EQIP for this purpose is modest to meager. With appropriate
   program adjustments and increased grower awareness, USDA NRCS
   conservation programs, and the EQIP in particular, may provide an
   important opportunity for growers to increase their use of IPM Lis a
   resource conservation and farm management tool.}},

   including a lottery incentive in health surveys {[}ISRCTN32203485]}},
Journal = {{BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Background: Postal questionnaires are an economical and simple method of
   data collection for research purposes but are subject to non-response
   bias. Several studies have explored the effect of monetary and
   non-monetary incentives on response. Recent meta-analyses conclude that
   financial incentives are an effective way of increasing response rates.
   However, large surveys rarely have the resources to reward individual
   participants. Three previous papers report on the effectiveness of
   lottery incentives with contradictory results. This study aimed to
   determine the effect of including a lottery-style incentive on response
   rates to a postal health survey.
   Methods: Randomised controlled trial. Setting: North and West
   Birmingham. 8,645 patients aged 18 or over randomly selected from
   registers of eight general practices (family physician practices).
   Intervention: Inclusion of a flyer and letter with a health
   questionnaire informing patients that returned questionnaires would be
   entered into a lottery-style draw for pound100 of gift vouchers.
   Control: Health questionnaire accompanied only by standard letter of
   explanation. Main outcome measures: Response rate and completion rate to
   questionnaire.
   Results: 5,209 individuals responded with identical rates in both groups
   (62.1\%). Practice, patient age, sex and Townsend score (a postcode
   based deprivation measure) were identified as predictive of response,
   with higher response related to older age, being female and living in an
   area with a lower Townsend score (less deprived).
   Conclusion: This RCT, using a large community based sample, found that

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to (a) investigate the extent to which
   academic faculty practice plans (FPPs) are currently involved in
   ambulatory care quality improvement (QI), (b) describe the structure of
   QI initiatives at outpatient FPPs, and (c) delineate facilitators and
   barriers to development of FPP outpatient QI initiatives. Members of the
   Steering Committee of the Group Practice Council of the University
   HealthSystem Consortium (UHC), representing the leadership of 88 FPPs,
   were asked to respond to a 38-item Web-based questionnaire during
   February and March 2003. The survey elicited information on the
   organizational characteristics of FPPs, their current degree of
   engagement in outpatient QI activities, and factors driving interest and
   barriers impeding efforts to conduct outpatient QI initiatives.
   Descriptive statistics for all variables of interest were performed.
   Responses were received from 33 participants believed to represent at
   least 28 of the total 88 FPP members of the UHC. Nearly all respondents
   indicated that some types of outpatient QI initiatives were currently
   taking place in their FPP. However, only 12\% of respondents met 4 or
   more of the 6 criteria deemed to be essential to having a robust
   outpatient QI program. Among key QI indicators, one third of respondents
   reported that their FPP had a separate and distinct outpatient quality
   committee, and some one fifth had a budget for outpatient QI or
   financial incentives for outpatient clinics to engage in QI (or both).
   The majority of respondents stated that at least some departments in
   their FPP were collecting quality data. Most respondents reported that
   patient safety and external demand for outpatient QI were the ``more
   important{''} factors driving QI efforts, whereas lack of human
   resources and other resources were the ``more significant{''} barriers
   hindering QI initiatives. The results of the study suggest that,
   although FPPs showed a strong interest in outpatient QI initiatives,
   FPPs' efforts are still in an infancy phase and lag far behind inpatient
   performance measurement activities. Without appropriate resources, it
   appears unlikely that FPPs will be able to move the agenda forward to
   develop a quality culture and robust program of self-assessment and
   improvement in the outpatient setting.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Aviation crashes are a leading cause of occupational
   fatalities in Alaska, with Alaskan pilots having nearly 100 times the
   fatality rate of U.S. workers overall. A survey was designed to study
   pilot and company practices and attitudes in order to develop
   intervention strategies that would reduce aviation fatalities. Methods:
   Two surveys were administered: one of air carrier operators and one of
   active commercial pilots. Surveys from 153 air taxi and public-use
   operators were received at a 79\% response rate. Results: There are
   almost 2000 pilots employed in Alaska during peak season by air taxi
   operators and public agencies. Surveyed operators and pilots generally
   agreed that improved weather information and regional hazards training
   would be effective ways to prevent crashes. Operators were more in favor
   of operator financial incentives (p < 0.05) and better pre-employment
   hiring checks on pilots (p < 0.05) compared with pilots' survey
   responses. There were 48\% of pilots of large operators and 73\% of
   pilots of small operators who considered their jobs to be at least as
   safe as other jobs. Conclusions: The results of operator-pilot
   comparisons suggest that financial pressures on operators may influence
   their views on what measures would be effective in preventing crashes,
   and that Alaskan pilots underestimate their occupational fatality risk.}},

Journal = {{PERITONEAL DIALYSIS INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{531-537}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background. The factors that determine dialysis modality selection and
   distribution are not well understood. Physician reimbursement incentives
   have been suggested to play an important role. Under the fee-for-service
   system in Ontario that existed prior to July 1998, nephrologists were
   paid about sevenfold more for a hemodialysis (HD) patient than for a
   patient on peritoneal dialysis (PD). However, since then, nephrologists
   have been reimbursed via a modality-independent capitation fee, whereby
   payment for any form of dialysis is the same. This was expected to
   markedly increase the use of PD.
   Methods: When the capitation fee was introduced in 1998, a survey
   questionnaire of all Ontario nephrologists was done and repeated 3 years
   later (response rate 62.5\%). Changes in dialysis modality incidence and
   prevalence rates in Ontario and in the rest of Canada were examined.
   Results: On a scale of 1 to 7, nephrologists were convinced that the
   capitation fee was a good thing (mean rating 6.07); 75\% said they had
   been seeing patients at every dialysis under the old system, compared to
   41\% now. Of significance, the proportion of prevalent patients on PD in
   Ontario declined from 27.3\% in 1997 to 19.7\% in 2000, increasing to
   22.6\% in 2002. Similarly, the incident PD rate seems to have
   stabilized, while the use of non-hospital-based HD has increased.
   Conclusions: Following the introduction of the capitation fee, PD use in
   Ontario continued to decline for 2 years, and then began to increase. In
   the rest of Canada, there are continuing declines in PD use. This is
   consistent with the hypothesis that the new incentives caused by the
   altered physician reimbursement are acting in a subtle way. Perit Dial

Abstract = {{Background. Clinical preventive services improve patient health, and
   reminder systems can increase the use of such services. However,
   physician organizations often underutilize clinical preventive service
   reminders. Little is known about the incentives, capabilities, and
   organizational characteristics associated with the use of reminders by
   physician organizations.
   Methods. The predictors of patient and physician reminder system use
   were examined in a sample of 1,104 US physician organizations. The
   cross-sectional sample was obtained through a telephone survey with a
   70\% response rate.
   Results. Fifty-one percent of physician organizations used mammogram
   reminders, 41\% used influenza immunization reminders, and 26\% used eye
   exam reminders for patients. Eighteen percent of physician organizations
   used computer-generated reminders to physicians. Required reporting of
   data (P = 0.0006), public recognition for quality (P = 0.0002), and IT
   capabilities (P < 0.0001) were strongly associated with patient reminder
   use. Medical groups were more likely to use patient-level reminders than
   independent practice associations (IPAs) (P < 0.0001). Physician
   reminder use was related to required reporting of data (P < 0.0001) and
   IT capabilities (P < 0.0001).
   Conclusions. Physician organizations have relatively low use of
   preventive service reminders to patients and physicians. Offering
   quality incentives to physician organizations and improving their IT
   capabilities may increase the use of preventive service reminders and
   improve the delivery of preventive care. (C) 2004 The Institute For

   Study Design and Patient Populations: We conducted a mailed survey, in
   both Spanish and English, among women with abnormal Pap smears, who were
   members of a large managed care organization. Telephone follow up for
   non-responders was performed by a bilingual interviewer. A 20-minute
   long distance telephone card was offered as an incentive to individuals

   Results: Of the 1049 potentially eligible participants, 733 women

Abstract = {{Objectives: To evaluate whether small monetary incentives improve

   no one has evaluated emergency physicians' response rate and cost per

   responses and per-participant costs between a \$2 bill and a \$250
   lottery. Methods: Two groups of 288 emergency physicians were randomly
   selected and mailed a survey. Within each group of 288, half received a
   \$2 bill and the other half received an offer that respondents would be
   entered into a drawing to win \$250. Nonresponders received a reminder

   mailing of the survey three weeks after the initial mailing. Results: Of
   the 576 surveys that were mailed, nine (2\%) subjects were ineligible or

Journal = {{HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{4, 2}},
Pages = {{1055-1070}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Context. Despite widespread publicity of consumer-directed health plans,
   little is known about their prevalence and the extent to which their
   designs adequately reflect and support consumerism.
   Objective. We examined three types of consumer-directed health plans:
   health reimbursement accounts (HRAs), premium-tiered, and point-of-care
   tiered benefit plans. We sought to measure the extent to which these
   plans had diffused, as well as to provide a critical look at the ways in
   which these plans support consumerism. Consumerism in this context
   refers to efforts to enable informed consumer choice and consumers'
   involvement in managing their health. We also wished to determine
   whether mainstream health plans-health maintenance organization (HMO),
   point of service (POS), and preferred provider organization (PPO)
   models-were being influenced by consumerism.
   Data Sources/Study Setting. Our study uses national survey data
   collected by Mercer Human Resource Consulting from 680 national and
   regional commercial health benefit plans on HMO, PPO, POS, and
   consumer-directed products.
   Study Design. We defined consumer-directed products as health benefit
   plans that provided (1) consumer incentives to select more economical
   health care options, including self-care and no care, and (2)
   information and support to inform such selections. We asked health plans
   that offered consumer-directed products about 2003 enrollment, basic
   design features, and the availability of decision support. We also asked
   mainstream health plans about their activities that supported
   consumerism (e.g., proactive outreach to inform or influence enrollee
   behavior, such as self-management or preventive care, reminders sent to
   patients with identified medical conditions.)
   Data Collection/Extraction Methods. We analyzed survey responses for all
   four product lines in order to identify those plans that offer health
   reimbursement accounts (HRAs), premium-tiered, or point-of-care tiered
   models as well as efforts of mainstream health plans to engage informed
   consumer decision making.
   Principal findings. The majority of enrollees in consumer-directed
   health plans are in tiered models (primarily point-of-care tiered
   networks) rather than HRAs. Tiers are predominantly determined based on
   both cost and quality criteria. Enrollment in HRAs has grown
   substantially, in part because of the entry of mainstream managed care
   plans into the consumer-directed market. Health reimbursement accounts,
   tiered networks, and traditional managed care plans vary in their
   capacity to support consumers in managing their health risks and
   selection of provider and treatment options, with HRAs providing the
   most and mainstream plans the least.
   Conclusion. While enrollment in consumer-directed health plans continues
   to grow steadily, it remains a tiny fraction of all employer-sponsored
   coverage. Decision support in these plans, a critical link to help
   consumers make more informed choices, is also still limited. This lack
   may be of concern in light of the fact that only a minority of such
   plans report that they monitor claims to protect against underuse.
   Tiered benefit models appear to be more readily accepted by the market
   than HRAs. If they are to succeed in optimizing consumers' utility from
   health benefit spending, careful attention needs to be paid to how well
   these models inform consumers about the consequences of their
   selections.}},

Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{777-784}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Improving response rates, particularly among physicians, is
   important to minimize nonresponder bias and increase the effective
   sample size in epidemiologic research. We conducted a randomized trial
   to examine the impact of prepayment vs. postpayment incentives on
   response rates.
   Study Design and Setting: Self-completion postal questionnaires were
   mailed to 949 physicians who were respondents to an earlier survey and
   representative of the general physician population in Hong Kong. These
   physicians were randomly allocated to receive a HK\$20 cash prepayment
   incentive that accompanied the survey (n = 474) or a postpayment reward
   of the same amount on receipt of the completed questionnaire (n = 475).
   Results: The final prepayment response rate was 82.9\%, compared with
   72.5\% in the postpayment arm (P <.001). Of the eight alternative
   incentive and follow-up strategies evaluated, three lie on the
   efficiency frontier (i.e., not dominated), including postpayment with
   three mailings at HK\$42.7, prepayment with three mailings at HK\$66.5
   and prepayment with three mailings and telephone follow-up at HK\$112.1
   per responder recruited (US\$1 = HK\$7.8).
   Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that prepayment cash incentives are
   superior to postpayment of the equivalent amount in improving response
   rates among a representative sample of Hong Kong physicians. Further
   research should concentrate on confirming the generalizability of these
   findings in other health care occupation groups and settings. (C) 2004

Abstract = {{Using farm-level survey data from Ethiopia, this paper estimates a

   Peasant farmers, at least in the more commercial Central and Southern
   zones, do respond positively and significantly to price incentives.
   Farmers in the Northern zone are least commercial and least responsive
   to prices, and in fact the model based on profit maximisation does not
   adequately capture their behaviour. In general, non-price factors,
   especially rainfall and market access, are more important than prices in
   affecting production, and which factors are most important varies
   depending on the crop and region in question. We conclude with
   suggestions regarding which crops appear most suitable to each

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Understanding the roles and responsibilities of physicians
   who manage mutual patients is important for assuring good patient care.
   Among physicians expressing a preference to involve a neurologist in the
   care of a patient, we evaluated agreement between neurologists and
   primary care physicians for the extent of specialty involvement in the
   evaluation and management of the patient, and the factors influencing
   those preferences.
   DESIGN AND SETTING: A self-administered survey containing 3 clinical
   scenarios was developed with the assistance of a multispecialty advisory
   board and mailed to a stratified probability sample of physicians.
   PARTICIPANTS: Six hundred and eight family physicians, 624 general
   internists, and 492 neurologists in 9 U.S. states.
   INTERVENTIONS: For each scenario, those respondents who preferred
   involvement of a specialist were asked about the preferred extent of
   that involvement: one-time consultation with and without test/medication
   ordering, consultation and limited follow-up, or taking over ongoing
   care of the specialty problem as long as it persists.
   MAIN RESULTS: Survey response rate was 60\%. For all 3 scenarios,
   neurologists preferred a greater extent of specialty involvement
   compared to primary care physicians (all P < .05). Other physician and
   practice characteristic factors, including financial incentives, had
   lesser or no influence on the extent of specialty involvement preferred.
   CONCLUSIONS: The disagreement between primary care physicians and
   specialists regarding the preferred extent of specialist involvement in
   the care of patients with neurological conditions should raise serious
   concerns among health care providers, policy makers, and educators about
   whether mutual patient care is coordinated and appropriate.}},

Abstract = {{Context: Many states attempt to entice young generalist physicians into
   rural and medically underserved areas with financial support-for-service
   programs-scholarships, service-option loans, loan repayment, direct
   financial incentives, and resident support programs-with little
   documentation of their effectiveness.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to assess outcomes of states'
   support-for-service programs as a group and to compare outcomes of the 5
   program types.
   Design: We conducted a cross-sectional, primarily descriptive study.
   Participants: We studied all 69 state programs operating in 1996 that
   provided financial support to medical students, residents, and
   practicing physicians in exchange for a period of service in underserved
   areas; federally funded initiatives were excluded. We also surveyed 434
   generalist physicians who served in 29 of these state programs and a
   matched comparison group of 723 nonobligated young generalist
   physicians.
   Data Collection: Information on eligible programs was collected by
   telephone, mail questionnaires, and from secondary sources. Obligated
   and nonobligated physicians were surveyed, with 80.3\% and 72.8\%
   response rates, respectively.
   Main Outcome Measures: Levels of socioeconomic need of communities and
   patients served by physicians, programs' participant service completion
   and retention rates, and physicians' satisfaction levels.
   Results: Compared with young nonobligated generalists, physicians
   serving obligations to state programs practiced in demonstrably needier
   areas and cared for more patients insured under Medicaid and uninsured
   (48.5\% vs. 28.5\%, P < 0.001). Service completion rates were uniformly
   high for loan repayment, direct incentive, and resident-support programs
   (93\% combined) but lower for student-targeting service-option loan
   (mean, 44.7\%) and scholarship (mean, 66.5\%) programs. State-obligated
   physicians were more satisfied than nonobligated physicians, and 9 of 10
   indicated that they would enroll in their programs again. Obligated
   physicians also remained longer in their practices than nonobligated
   physicians (P = 0.03), with respective group retention rates of 71\%
   versus 61\% at 4 years and 55\% versus 52\% at 8 years. Retention rates
   were highest for loan repayment, direct incentive, and loan programs.
   Conclusions: States' support-for-service programs bring physicians to
   needy communities where a strong majority work happily and with at-risk
   patient populations; half stay over 8 years. Loan repayment and direct
   financial incentive programs demonstrate the broadest successes.}},

   Design: Cross-sectional mail survey.
   Participants and Setting: Six hundred nineteen generalist physicians
   (62\% response rate) caring for managed care patients in 3 Minnesota
   health plans during 1999.
   Measurements and Main Results: Twenty-six percent of physicians reported
   pressure to limit referrals. In adjusted analyses, female physicians and
   those who were board certified acted as gatekeepers for most of their
   patients, received incentives based on performance reports and quality
   profiles, and received direct income from capitation, and were more
   likely than others to report this pressure (all P<.05). Sixty-two
   percent reported pressure to see more patients. In adjusted analyses,
   this pressure was more frequent among physicians in practices owned by
   health systems, those using physician extenders, and among physicians
   paid by salary with performance adjustment or those receiving at least
   some capitation (all P<.05). One-quarter (24\%) of physicians were
   dissatisfied with their career in medicine. In adjusted analyses,
   physicians reporting pressure to limit referrals (risk ratio, 1.12; 95\%
   confidence interval, 1.01 to 1.19) and those reporting pressure to see
   more patients (risk ratio, 1.37; 95\% confidence interval, 1.08 to 1.66)

   Conclusions: Pressures to limit referrals and to see more patients are
   common, particularly among physicians paid based on productivity or

Abstract = {{Drug testing was used as an adjunct to a general population household
   drug use survey administered via audio computer assisted self-interview.
   Participants, ages 18-40 years residing in Chicago, were recruited to
   participate in three different biological tests (hair, oral fluid, and
   urine) presented in random order subsequent to completing an interview.
   Subjects had the option of participating in zero to three different
   tests. We examined participation/refusal in tests, reaction to testing
   requests, as well as variables associated with participation and
   reaction. Subjects were randomly assigned to a low (US\$ 10 per test) or
   high (US\$ 20 per test) incentive condition. Over 90\% of the sample
   participated in at least one test, usually the oral fluid test.
   Associations between refusal status and two variables, socioeconomic
   status (SES) and presence of children in the household, provided partial
   support for the notion that drug test participation parallels the survey
   response process in general. Incentive level did not directly increase
   drug test participation. Reporting of recent illicit drug use was
   associated with participation in only one procedure, hair testing. Type
   of test offered and individual differences in willingness to be drug
   tested were important predictors of drug test refusal and subject
   reaction to testing requests. Compared with urine and hair testing, oral
   fluid testing had lower refusal rates and was generally more acceptable
   to respondents in a general population survey. The findings support the
   feasibility of incorporating multiple drug tests with modest incentives
   into general population household surveys on drug abuse. (C) 2003

   among inner city children have been documented.
   Objective: To establish and evaluate a large-scale, school-based
   case-detection process designed to efficiently and reliably identify
   inner city children with asthma.
   Methods: A bilingual, seven-question, self-administered, parental asthma
   screening survey was developed. Clinical validation was achieved in a
   sample of 675 consecutive parents bringing a child to the school-based
   Breathmobile Program for initial evaluation, using a comprehensive
   evaluation by a physician specialist (ie, allergist) as the standard.
   Survey response patterns were used to construct a novel seven-model,
   tiered scoring algorithm and an abbreviated algorithm that predict the
   probability of a child being clinically classified as ``yes asthma{''}
   or ``no asthma.{''} A systematic survey distribution process
   administered by a single coordinator was developed, and the impact of a
   classroom-oriented incentive offering a \$25 school supply gift
   certificate for survey return rates of greater than or equal to 80\% was
   evaluated.
   Results: A total of 636 parents provided one or more survey responses
   and information sufficient for clinical classification. The scoring
   algorithm correctly identified children with asthma (greater than or
   equal to 80\% probability) with a sensitivity of 86.5\%, a specificity
   of 83.6\%, and a misclassification rate of 14.3\% (91 of 636 children).
   The sensitivity for identifying persistent asthma was 91.3\%. Asthma
   prevalence estimates derived using survey results from a larger sampling
   of the general population were similar to rates previously reported for
   comparable populations. The inclusion of an inexpensive incentive
   increased the median survey return rates from 35.3 to 65\% (z = -11.9; p
   < .001). The screening process has been used to conduct 27,526 surveys

Abstract = {{During the last decade there has been a dramatic increase in the both
   the number and the rate of Mexican naturalization. Some have interpreted
   this increase as a response to changes in welfare and immigration policy
   surrounding the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity
   Reconciliation Act (PRWORA), which limited public assistance to
   noncitizens, and the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant
   Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), which may have increased the incentive to
   naturalize by making it more difficult for legal immigrants to sponsor
   their relatives for entry to the United States. This article uses
   Current Population Survey data from 1994/95 and 2000/01 to examine how
   the social and economic determinants of naturalization may have changed
   in order to provide insight into which explanation for the increase in
   naturalizations is most relevant. We find that while the proportion of
   Mexican immigrants who are naturalized increased during the 1990s, their
   determinants have remained largely the same with e exception that those
   with noncitizen spouses have become more likely to be naturalized in the
   post-reform period. This suggests that a more cautious interpretation be
   taken about the relationship between the increase in naturalizations and

Abstract = {{Background: The influence of payment mechanisms on physician decisions
   is not well understood.
   Objectives: The objective of this study was to test 2 null hypotheses:
   1) physicians' clinical decisions would not be influenced by payment
   incentives; and 2) physicians would have equal concern about medical
   decisions made under capitation or fee-for-service (FFS) arrangements.
   Research Design: We conducted a physician survey in which patient
   insurance status (capitated or FFS) was randomly incorporated into 4
   clinical scenarios using a Latin square design.
   Subjects: We used a nationally representative random sample of family
   physicians in direct patient care.
   Measures: We used treatment decisions and physician ``bother{''} scores
   (a measure of discomfort about decisions) in response to the clinical
   scenarios and adjusted for physician gender, age, board certification,
   income, practice location, practice mix, practice setting, geographic
   region, local area managed care penetration, and capitation or risk pool
   contracts in practice.
   Results: Seventy-two percent of sampled physicians responded. Comparing
   decisions made under capitation to FFS, physicians were less likely to
   indicate they would perform discretionary care (relative risks {[}RR]
   range, .64-.82; P <0.001), but payment had no effect on selection of
   life-saving care (RR, 1.02, not significant). Physicians felt
   significantly more ``bothered{''} when they made clinical decisions
   under capitatedpayment (P <0.001 in all scenarios), regardless of
   whether a treatment was discretionary or life-saving, and whether the
   decision was made for or against the treatment (P <0.001).
   Conclusions: Payment mechanism has significant effects on clinical
   decision-making. Reduction of resources spent for discretionary care
   might be achieved under capitated arrangements; however, physicians
   respond with greater levels of discomfort under capitation than FFS.}},

Title = {{Board of pharmaceutical specialties-certified faculty: A survey of
   United States colleges of pharmacy}},

Abstract = {{Board certification of pharmacists has been a reality in the United
   States since 1976, when the Board of Pharmaceutical Specialties (BPS)
   was founded. Little has been reported about the effects of board
   certification of pharmacists, particularly pharmacy practice faculty,
   since 1992, when the BPS administered its first certification
   examination. We developed and pretested a survey to describe and measure
   the effect of BPS certification on the realm of academia as perceived by
   deans of colleges of pharmacy in the United States. Deans or other
   appropriate officials at all 84 colleges of pharmacy in the United
   States were asked to complete and submit this 13-question survey, which
   was administered through the Web and maintained respondents' anonymity.
   Officials from 35 of the 84 colleges completed the survey, for a
   response rate of 42\%. No college reported that board certification was
   a condition for employment. Eight schools (23\%) anticipated a
   certification requirement in the future. The most commonly reimbursed
   items associated with certification were fees for the American College
   of Clinical Pharmacy preparatory course and the BPS examination. Twelve
   schools (34\%) provided no reimbursement toward certification. The most
   common incentive for faculty to obtain certification was consideration
   in promotion and tenure (66\%). We believe that this information will
   facilitate efforts to gauge the effects of BPS certification on colleges
   of pharmacy We also anticipate that it will assist colleges as they
   attempt to recruit and retain the most qualified faculty members
   possible, particularly in light of the national pharmacist shortage.}},

Volume = {{68}},

Abstract = {{While a low survey response rate may indicate that the risk of
   nonresponse error is high, we know little about when nonresponse causes
   such error and when nonresponse is ignorable. Leverage-salience theory
   of survey participation suggests that when the survey topic is a factor
   in the decision to participate, noncooperation will cause nonresponse
   error. We test three hypotheses derived from the theory: (1) those faced
   with a survey request on a topic of interest to them cooperate at higher
   rates than do those less interested in the topic; (2) this tendency for
   the ``interested{''} to cooperate more readily is diminished when
   monetary incentives are offered; and (3) the impact of interest on
   cooperation has nonignorability implications for key statistics. The
   data come from a three-factor experiment examining the impact on
   cooperation with surveys on (a) five different topics, using (b) samples
   from five different populations that have known attributes related to
   the topics, with (c) two different incentive conditions.}},

Title = {{No difference in response rate to a mailed survey among prostate cancer

Abstract = {{Mailed surveys are widely used to collect epidemiological and health
   service data on cancer populations. Nonresponse can threaten the
   validity of surveys and various strategies, including the enclosure of
   modest incentives, are often used to increase response rates. A study
   was undertaken to determine whether response rate to a mailed survey
   differed with provision of immediate versus delayed incentives. A
   six-page mailed survey to ascertain dietary supplement use was sent to
   1402 men who had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. Subjects were
   block randomized into two groups based on age (:565 years versus >65
   years), race (white versus nonwhite), and disease status (locoregional
   versus distant). One group received a 30-min prepaid phone card
   concurrently with their blank survey (unconditional incentive), whereas
   the other group received the incentive only on receipt of their
   completed survey (conditional incentive). A 60\% overall response rate
   was achieved, and no differences in response rates were noted between
   conditional and unconditional incentive groups (overall, as well as
   within defined age, race, and disease-defined strata). Nonwhites,
   however, were significantly less likely to respond than whites (P <
   0.0001). In conclusion, acceptable response rates to a mailed survey can
   be achieved in a general population of cancer survivors using modest
   incentives. Given no differences in response rates using conditional
   versus unconditional incentives, the decision to provide immediate
   versus delayed incentives is one that should be considered on a
   study-specific basis, and a decision based primarily on cost. Other
   means, however, appear necessary to achieve acceptable response rates
   among minority group cancer survivors.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the effect of the timing of follow-ups, different
   incentives, length, and presentation of the questionnaire on the
   response rate and response quality in an online experimental setting.
   The results show that short questionnaires have a higher response rate,
   although long questionnaires still generate a surprisingly high
   response. Furthermore, vouchers seem to be the most effective incentive
   in long questionnaires, while lotteries are more efficient in short
   surveys. A follow-up study revealed that lotteries with small prizes,
   but a higher chance of winning are most effective in increasing the
   response rate. Enhancing questionnaires with visual elements, such as
   product images, lead to a higher response quality and generate
   interesting interaction effects with the length of the questionnaire and
   the incentives used. Finally, the timing of the follow-up has no
   significant influence on the response rate.}},
