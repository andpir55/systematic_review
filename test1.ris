N2  - This article analyzes selection incentives for insurers in the Dutch
basic health insurance market, which operates with community-rated
premiums and sophisticated risk adjustment. Selection incentives result
from the interplay of three market characteristics: possible actions by
insurers, consumer response to these actions, and predictable variation
in profitability of insurance contracts. After a qualitative analysis of
the first two characteristics our primary objective is to identify the
third. Using a combination of claims data (N= 16.8 million) and survey
information (N= 387,195), we find substantial predictable variation in
profitability. On average, people in good health are profitable, while
those in poor health are unprofitable. We conclude that Dutch insurers
indeed face selection incentives. A complete measure of selection
incentives, however, captures the correlation between individual-level
profitability and consumer response to insurer-actions. Obtaining
insight in this correlation is an important direction for further
research.

N2  - Incentives can influence travelers' mobility decisions and thus be used
to indirectly redistribute traffic demands in space and in time to
reduce congestion. This study aims to understand travelers' mobility
decisions in response to customer incentives. An online questionnaire
survey was conducted to obtain travelers' opinions and preferences on
customer incentives. The results suggest that incentive types and
travelers' personal and social-economic attributes are coupled to affect
their acceptance and rejection decisions. This study sheds light on
using incentives to switch near-by travelers to potential business
customers during peak hours, which ultimately contributes to congestion
relief and economic prosperity.

N2  - Background There is a general perception that research is underdeveloped
in rehabilitation professions. However, a PubMed search found that the
growth in publications in the rehabilitation field was twice that of the
general medical field. Despite this growth, another study focusing on
Europe found that the proportion of articles reporting on clinical
research in the rehabilitation field remained low (less than 40% of
articles). This could be due to lack of teaching about research in
rehabilitation schools or the late introduction of such courses. Aims
Describe the students' perceptions of research: their desire to conduct
research, the usefulness of research and research competence. Methods
Questionnaire survey targeting all French paramedical students (speech
therapy, occupational therapy, psychomotricity, audiometry,
physiotherapy, orthoptics) in their final year of study in 2018-2019.
Results Overall, 791 students completed the full survey representing a
response rate of 36.3% of the students contacted. Only 34.3% of
rehabilitation students were willing to conduct research despite finding
it useful (98.6%). The main barrier was the preference for their core
operational work (cited 444 times, representing 17.6% of citations).
There was a significant relation between perceived competence and the
attractiveness of research: 84% of the students not interested in
research felt they were not competent to conduct research but this
figure dropped to 57.6% amongst the students interested in research (OR
4.0; 95% CI 2.9-5.6). Using a multivariate analysis, we confirmed that
the main incentive was feeling competent, as well as past contact with
research and supervisors who promoted research work. Conclusion Students
have little contact with research during their internships, low
perceived competence and, consequently, little desire to conduct
research.

N2  - While collecting high quality data from physicians is critical, response
rates for physician surveys are frequently low. A proven method for
increasing response in mail surveys is to provide a small, prepaid
monetary incentive in the initial mailing. More recently, researchers
have begun experimenting with adding a second cash incentive in a
follow-up contact in order to increase participation among more
reluctant respondents. To assess the effects of sequential incentives on
response rates, data quality, sample representativeness, and costs,
physicians (N = 1,500) were randomly assigned to treatments that crossed
the amount of a first ($5 or $10) and second ($0, $5, or $10)
incentive to form the following groups: Group $5/$5; Group $5/$10;
Group $10/$0; Group $10/$5; and Group $10/$10. Overall, second
incentives were associated with higher response rates and lower costs
per completed survey, and while they had no effect on item nonresponse,
they increased sample representativeness.

N2  - Context: There is limited research on what factors are most salient to
implementation of evidence-based practices (EBPs) among public health
agencies in public health emergency preparedness and response (PHPR) and
under what conditions EBP implementation will occur. Objective: This
study assessed the conditions, barriers, and enablers affecting EBP
implementation among the PHPR practice community and identified
opportunities to support EBP implementation. Design: A Web-based survey
gathered information from public health agencies. Data obtained from 228
participating agencies were analyzed. Setting: State, local, and
territorial public health agencies across the United States.
Participants: Preparedness program officials from 228 public health
agencies in the United States, including Public Health Emergency
Preparedness (PHEP) cooperative agreement awardees (PHEP awardees) and a
random sample of local health departments (LHDs). Results: Respondents
indicated that EBP is necessary and improves PHPR functions and tasks
and that staff are interested in improving skills for EBP
implementation. Top system-level barriers to EBP implementation were
insufficient funding, lack of EBP, and lack of clarity regarding which
practices are evidence based. PHEP awardees were significantly more
likely to report a lack of EBP in the field, whereas LHDs were
significantly more likely to report a lack of incentives. The top
organizational-level barrier was insufficient staff. Most respondents
indicated their agency culture supports EBP; however, LHDs were
significantly more likely to report a lack of support from supervisors
and leadership. Few respondents reported individual barriers to EBP
implementation. Conclusions: Findings indicate an opportunity to improve
dissemination strategies, communication efforts, and incentives to
support EBP implementation in PHPR. Potential strategies include
improving awareness of and accessibility to EBPs through targeted
dissemination efforts; building organizational capacity to support EBP
implementation, particularly staff capacity, knowledge, and skills; and
identifying funding and incentives to promote EBP uptake and
sustainment.

N2  - Car sharing (CS) service has grown as one of the components of
multimodal mobility in urban transport and it is expected to lead to a
reduction in personal car ownership, thereby mitigating urban congestion
and parking demand. It also provides last-mile mobility to complement
public transport. Against this backdrop, a lot of studies have been
conducted to make clear the effectiveness of CS services. However, most
of the previous studies were surveys aimed at current CS users, and only
a few studies have evaluated whether general car owners and non-owners
might become members of CS services in the future.
In this study, a survey was conducted among 1000 car owners in Japan as
to whether CS services would induce them to stop owning a car. At the
time of the survey, the respondents' current annual cost of owning a car
was automatically displayed by calculating the amount from previous
answers about their attributes. With this questionnaire method, it is
presumed that respondents answered with a stronger awareness of the high
cost of car ownership, so their responses might have reflected a
consideration of the economic benefits of CS services. The results
showed that 74% of car owners answered that they would not stop owning
a car no matter how inexpensive CS services were and even if there was
no risk of vehicle unavailability. The percentage was almost the same in
every range of household income, and 40% said the reason was
familiarity with and attachment to a car and 54% cited convenience in
emergencies. These results suggest that in order to spread CS services
for further reducing personal car ownership, emotional incentives are
required to compensate for certain disadvantages of CS services, e.g.,
the lack of excitement derived from car ownership, potential
non-availability in emergencies, and so on.
A survey was also conducted among 1000 non-car owners in order to
analyze and compare the utility of car ownership. The results showed
that the perceived utility of car ownership was 2-10 times greater for
owners than for non-owners. CS service providers and urban transport
policymakers should be aware of this value when designing businesses and
policies. Consideration should also be given to the various objectives
of CS services such as between aiming to reducing car ownership and
aiming to improve urban transport for non-car owners. Further research
is required to optimize CS services for efficient urban transport
design.

N2  - Ethnic settlement patterns and other forms of everyday interethnic
social contact have the potential to influence voter preferences for
ethnic tribune parties who position themselves as the most strident
protectors of, and flagbearers for, their respective ethnic groups.
Previous studies on this topic have come to rival conclusions, with some
finding that increased intergroup contact and residential mixing produce
a corresponding increase in support for tribune parties and others
finding the opposite. This study uses a combination of data from
elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly from 1998 to 2017 and survey
data from 2016 to evaluate these rival arguments and assess the extent
to which the broader institutional and demographic context in which
political competition takes place condition responses to intergroup
contact. Our findings indicate that voters in both declining and
ascending demographic groups respond similarly to intergroup contact,
expressing less support for tribune parties in contexts where
residential patterns and social networks provide more opportunities for
intergroup contact. These results highlight the conditional nature of
the effectiveness of consensus-based institutions in divided societies:
they can create incentives for moderation, but those incentives are most
likely to be realized in contexts where rival groups experience a high
level of integration.

N2  - Electricity generation in the United States is rapidly moving towards
integrating more renewables into the system due to several factors,
including cost competitiveness, consumer preferences, and state and
federal policies, such as production and income tax incentives,
renewable portfolio standards (RPSs), and state level subsidies for
solar energy. While these policies have been researched comprehensively,
in this paper we investigate consumer preference and willingness to pay
toward renewable energy. Consumer preferences may impact the type of
renewable energy utilized, as well as state-determined RPS requirements.
We implement a choice experiment survey to gain understanding of
consumer preferences and their preference heterogeneity. We conduct the
survey in New Mexico, a state with RPS and great potential for
renewables, particularly in solar where it ranks third in the U.S. for
that potential. Focusing on the consumers of the state's major utility,
our choice experiment considers an increase in renewable energy and
preference for different types of solar energy (rooftop solar and solar
farm). We control for location heterogeneity (i.e., rural vs. urban), as
well as exposure to solar installations. Utilizing multinomial logit and
random parameter logit our results suggest respondents support an
increased RPS solar requirement and they have a positive marginal
willingness to pay (MWTP) for rooftop solar and smart meter
installation. These values are impacted by several factors, including
location and exposure to solar. We also observe a distance decay effect
on respondents' MWTP for different solar plans. For regulators
considering additional RPS levels, or utilities considering solar
installations, the results provide improved information on consumer
preferences, heterogeneity of response, and MWTP for solar energy.

N2  - As the predominant form of land use worldwide, family farming is
important in meeting the global challenge of food security. The present
research sought to identify the factors influencing the process of
family farming succession. In an effort to do so, we analyzed 150
responses to a farmer survey conducted in a region suffering a lack of
younger successors. The analysis, based on descriptive statistics and
logistic regression models, highlighted the importance of income as a
factor encouraging succession. Logistic regression models showed that
the number of family members employed, the farm size, the farm's annual
income, and incentives for succession are main factors that influence
expectation of a successor in the family farming succession process. The
identification of these factors provided important insights for the
development of interventions policies to encourage successors to take
over family farms.

N2  - Payments for ecosystem services (PES) have been initiated throughout
Brazil to encourage forest restoration on private lands, especially
smaller properties that are out of compliance with national land use
laws requiring conservation of native vegetation. A choice experiment of
189 farmers in the Cantareira region - the drinking water source for
over nine million people in the Sao Paulo metropolitan area - suggests
that existing PES contract incentives are unlikely to spur enrollment by
landowners with small properties and high dependence on agricultural
income. This group is unlikely to restore forest without compensation,
and survey responses indicate they need a much higher payment than
current payment structures provide. Our results also provide support for
the inclusion of in-kind incentives that increase agricultural
productivity as a means to encourage participation. These findings are
especially important in light of Brazil's commitments to forest
restoration under the country's Native Vegetation Protection Law and its
commitments through the Bonn Challenge to restore 15 million hectares of
Atlantic Forest by 2050.

N2  - Numerous empirical studies have sought to compare corruption across
regions or countries. It is however individuals who are corrupt, not
regions or countries. Studies of corruption should therefore investigate
individual behavior. This has not been previously possible other than in
survey responses on payment of bribes because of lack of data. We use
individual-level data from the China Corruption Conviction Databank to
investigate bribe-taking among officials in local-government
public-administration and parallel Party bureaucracies. We find that
bribes that officials received systematically increase with positions at
higher levels of official hierarchies. Economic authority to decide on
spending and regulation is associated with receiving greater bribes than
being in administrative positions. Consistent with life-cycle
incentives, entry-level and retirement-approaching officials take higher
bribes than middle-aged officials. Being more educated does not deter
corruption but on the contrary is associated with taking higher bribes.
Gender is not correlated with the size of the bribes taken. We link our
empirical results on bribes to the theory of rent seeking in
bureaucratic hierarchies. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background Evidence is needed regarding effective incentive strategies
to increase clinician survey response rates. Cash cards are increasingly
used as survey incentives; they are appealing because of their
convenience and because in some cases their value can be reclaimed by
investigators if not used. However, their effectiveness in clinician
surveys is not known. In this study within the BRCA Founder OutReach
(BFOR) study, a clinical trial of population-basedBRCA1/2mutation
screening, we compared the use of upfront cash cards requiring email
activation versus checks as clinician survey incentives. Methods
Participants receiving BRCA1/2 testing in the BFOR study could elect to
receive their results from their primary care provider (PCP, named by
the patient) or from a geneticist associated with the study. In order to
understand PCPs' knowledge, attitudes, experiences and willingness to
disclose results we mailed paper surveys to the first 501 primary care
providers (PCPs) in New York, Boston, Los Angeles and Philadelphia who
were nominated by study participants to disclose theirBRCA1/2mutation
results obtained through the study. We used alternating assignment
stratified by city to assign the first 303 clinicians to receive a $50
up-front incentive as a cash card (N = 155) or check (N = 148). The cash
card required PCPs to send an activation email in order to be used. We
compared response rates by incentive type, adjusting for PCP
characteristics and study site. Results In unadjusted analyses, PCPs who
received checks were more likely to respond to the survey than those who
received cash cards (54.1% versus 41.9%,p = 0.046); this remained true
when we adjusted for provider characteristics (OR for checks 1.61, 95%
CI 1.01, 2.59). No other clinician characteristics had a statistically
significant association with response rates in adjusted analyses. When
we included an interaction term for incentive type and city, the
favorable impact of checks on response rates was evident only in Los
Angeles and Philadelphia. Conclusions An up-front cash card incentive
requiring email activation may be less effective in eliciting clinician
responses than up-front checks. However, the benefit of checks for
clinician response rates may depend on clinicians' geographic location.

N2  - To improve the economic and environmental sustainability of agriculture,
information is needed on how to target research, teaching, and outreach
programs. However, conducting survey research in general, and with
agricultural producers specifically, is increasingly challenging given
issues such as declining response rates and limited resources. While
studies examining the best practices for promoting higher response rates
exist, few focus explicitly on agricultural producers. In three separate
surveys conducted with agricultural producers in South Dakota in 2018
and 2019, we included experiments testing how token pre-incentives, a
research partnership, and response mode options impacted response rates.
We also examined how sample source and email augmentations influence
survey responses. The study findings indicate that providing
pre-incentives and multiple simultaneous response options can increase
response rates with agricultural producers. On the other hand, email
augmentation to mail surveys, sample source, and identification of
select institutional research partnerships appear to have minimal
effects.

N2  - Background Despite widespread adoption of patient-centered medical home
(PCMH), little is known about why practices pursue PCMH and what is
needed to undergo transformation. Objective Examine reasons practices
obtained and maintained PCMH recognition and what resources were needed.
Design Qualitative study of practice leader perspectives on PCMH
transformation, based on a random sample of primary care practices
engaged in PCMH transformation, stratified by US region, practice size,
PCMH recognition history, and practice use of Consumer Assessment of
Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS (R)) PCMH survey. Participants
105 practice leaders from 294 sampled practices (36% response rate).
Approach Content analysis of interviews with practice leaders to
identify themes. Results Most practice leaders had local control of PCMH
transformation decisions, even if practices adopted quality initiatives
under the direction of an organization or network. Financial incentives,
being in a statewide effort, and the intrinsic desire to improve care or
experiences were the most common reasons practice leaders decided to
obtain PCMH recognition and pursue associated care delivery changes.
Leadership support and direction were highlighted as essential
throughout PCMH transformation. Practice leaders reported needing
specialized staff knowledge and significant resources to meet PCMH
requirements, including staff knowledgeable about how to implement PCMH
changes, track and monitor improvements, and navigate implementation of
simultaneous changes, and staff with specific quality improvement (QI)
expertise related to evaluating changes and scaling-up programs.
Conclusion PCMH efforts necessitated support and assistance to
frontline, on-site practice leaders leading care delivery changes. Such
change efforts should include financial incentives (e.g., direct payment
or additional reimbursement), leadership direction and support, and
internal or external staff with experience with the PCMH application
process, implementation changes, and QI expertise in monitoring process
and outcome data. Policies that recognize and meet the needs of on-site
practice leaders will better promote primary care practice
transformation and move practices further toward their PCMH
transformation goals.

N2  - Studies of travelers' response behavior to transportation demand
management is receiving substantial attention among researchers and
transport operators in recent years. While previous studies in this area
have generally assumed that the sensitivity of travelers to different
factors is homogeneous and relies on survey responses, which may be
prone to self-reporting errors and/or subject to behavioral
incongruence. Relying on naturalistic data, this paper aims to
investigate the behavioral response to pre-peak discount pricing
strategy in the context of the Beijing subway with a special focus on
the heterogeneity among the travelers. Anonymous smart card data from
5946 travelers before and after the introduction of a peak avoidance
policy in Beijing are used to construct a latent class choice model to
capture the sensitivity to different factors and the associated taste
heterogeneity of travelers. Given the passive nature of the data, the
model can offer more realistic outputs. The results indicate that there
is substantial heterogeneity in travelers' responses to the peak
avoidance policy, and that they can be probabilistically allocated to
four latent classes. For all classes of travelers, the decision to shift
their departure to off-peak is affected by the monetary saving, the
required change in departure time and the frequency of travel, but in
different magnitudes. In particular, only two classes of travelers (who
exhibit lower standard-deviation in pre-intervention departure time)
show significant sensitivity to price changes indicating that the
discount policies are more likely to be effective for these groups. The
rest of travelers are largely price insensitive - warranting the need
for non-monetary incentives as opposed to fare discounts. To the best of
our knowledge, this study is the first to innovatively apply the LCC
framework to analyze travelers' heterogeneous behavior using large-scale
smart card data without socio-demographic information. The findings can
provide guidance to the subway authority in devising differential peak
avoidance policies targeted for different groups of users, which are
likely to be more effective than the current one size fits all'
approach. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Interventions designed to reduce the burden of foodborne illness often
require value chain actors to alter undesired and risky behaviours. This
desired behavioural change may be supported by `nudge theory', a
sub-field of behavioural economics, which describes how individuals can
be encouraged, or `nudged', to act in ways which produce net societal
benefits without restricting freedom of choice.
This research aimed to investigate the use of nudges in the pork value
chain in Vietnam. Key informant interviews (n = 12) were initially
utilised to document the type of nudges being used within existing food
safety interventions, followed by a questionnaire-based survey (n = 132)
to describe the behavioural elements of pork value chain actors which
could be amenable to nudging. Finally, a workshop was conducted to
measure the response of stakeholders (n = 30) to various nudge elements
which could be used to support future food safety interventions.
Key informant interviews demonstrated that the use of behavioural nudges
were a common aspect of food safety interventions in the pork value
chain in Hanoi and Hung Yen Province. Survey participants reported that
when considering food safety, veterinarians and actors' peers were
highly trusted, and reputation was thought to be an effective incentive
to illicit behavioural change. During the workshop, stakeholders
appeared aware of the major slaughter and retail contamination points
and cited lack of access to improved infrastructure as the limiting
factor in their ability to improve hygiene. Value chain actors reported
positive responses to the concept of using posters containing
photographic images as nudges and stipulated that media should reflect
the local context and contain language framed to suit the target
audience.
We suggest that the findings of this study are used to create site
specific nudges for the Vietnamese pork industry targeting key value
chain actors, such slaughterhouse workers and traditional retailers,
which should be tested in the field to investigate their effectiveness.

N2  - The adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) have proven to be a crucial
factor to decreasing the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) into the
atmosphere. However, there are various hurdles that impede people from
purchasing EVs. For example, long charging time, short driving range,
cost and insufficient charging infrastructures available, etc. This
article reports the public perception of EV-adoption using statistical
analyses and proposes some recommendations for improving EV-adoption in
Qatar. User perspectives on EV-adoption barriers in Qatar were
investigated based on survey questionnaires. The survey questionnaires
were based on similar studies done in other regions of the world. The
study attempted to look at different perspectives of the adoption of EV,
when asked to a person who is aware of EVs (technical respondents-people
studying/working at universities/research centers and policy makers) or
a person who may or may not be aware of EVs (non-technical
respondents-people working in banks, governments and private
non-academic organizations, etc.). Cumulative survey responses from the
two groups were compared and analyzed using two-samplet-test statistical
analysis. Detailed analyses showed that-among various major
hindrances-raising of public awareness of such greener modes of
transportation, the availability of charging options in more places and
policy incentives towards EVs would play a major role in EV-adoption.
The authors provide recommendations that-along with government
incentives-could help make a gradual shift to a greater number of EVs
convenient for people of Qatar. The proposed systematic approach for
such a study and analysis may help in streamlining research on policies,
infrastructures and technologies for efficient penetration of EVs in
Qatar.

N2  - The main research problem discussed in this paper involves evaluation of
the motives of agricultural producers for pursuing and developing
organic production. The aim of this study is to identify and evaluate
the role of social values in stimulating decisions of involvement in
organic production. Analytical observations were conducted on the basis
of responses to surveys on a nation-representative sample in Poland (350
conventional farms and 70 organic farms in 2011; 260 conventional farms
and 65 organic farms in 2019). Analyses were conducted in relation to
the potential and perspectives for development of organic farming. They
were focused on identifying the original motives for such decisions
(incentives and disincentives). This allowed for effective evaluation of
both the trend and the pace of the studied processes. The development
potential of organic farming in Poland was estimated at 5-15% of the
total number of farms. The most important factors encouraging farmers to
take up production are associated with social values (care for the
natural environment and family health). A significant chance for the
development of organic production is the expected demand growth, which
is also related to social values: the increasing environmental awareness
and environmental change of consumption patterns.

N2  - The recreational use of natural resources requires the implementation of
sustainable management systems. However, the existence of socioeconomic
interests and the difficulty involved in applying evidence-based
criteria often hinder this implementation. The European wild rabbit
(Oryctolagus cuniculus) is an appropriate case with which to study the
recreational hunting governance systems. This species has, in recent
decades, undergone important population changes in its native area, the
Iberian Peninsula, where it plays a triple role as a game, pest and key
ecological species. The rabbit is consequently intensively managed for
hunting purposes, for the conservation of rabbit-dependent predators and
in order to mitigate damage to crops. In this paper, we study the
governance system of rabbit hunting through the use of questionnaire
surveys distributed to managers working for Spanish regional
governments. We repeated the survey in 2001 and 2016 in order to
evaluate how the system had evolved over a 15-year period of important
changes in rabbit population abundance. We found two different responses
to these changes. The growth of rabbit populations in provinces in which
rabbits cause crop damage in farmland areas has been dealt with an
increase in hunting pressure, derived from both administrative decisions
and hunters' management. However, in provinces where rabbit populations
have sharply declined in natural vegetation (non-farmland) areas, the
management seems to be driven mostly by inertia, with a high influence
of tradition and little use of evidence on administrative decisions.
Hunters in these provinces have changed their management practices to
little or no extent, where even the high importance of rabbit hunting
and its (moderate) economic importance do not appear to provide an
incentive for the change required.

N2  - Educational researchers regularly collect survey data from educators,
but struggle to encourage survey completion in this busy population,
particularly when surveys are web-based. In this study we experimentally
investigated the usefulness of follow-up phone calls and increased
monetary incentives to non-respondents as strategies to boost response
rates. We randomly assigned 540 hard-to-reach Michigan secondary school
principals to one of four conditions (control, call, incentive, or call
and incentive). We find that follow-up calls more than double the
likelihood of survey completion, while the offer of a larger monetary
incentive has no statistically significant effect. Integrating this
finding with recent literature on survey response rates in educational
settings, we conclude with a series of recommendations for researchers
surveying principals and other school administrators.

N2  - The randomized response technique (RRT) is an indirect question method
that uses stochastic noise to increase anonymity in surveys containing
sensitive items. Former studies often implicitly assumed that the
respondents trust and comply with the RRT procedure and, therefore, are
motivated to give truthful responses. However, validation studies
demonstrated that RRT may not always be successful in eliciting truthful
answering-even when compared with direct questioning. The article
theoretically explores and discusses the conditions under which this
assumption is consistent (or inconsistent) with the survey respondents'
rational behavior. First, becauseP(A vertical bar Yes) >P(A vertical bar
No), both types of respondents, A (with sensitive trait) and non-A
(without sensitive trait), have an incentive to disregard the
instructions in the RRT mode. In contrast, respondents type non-A have
no incentive to lie in the direct questioning mode. Thus, the potential
for social desirability bias is (theoretically) higher in the RRT mode.
Second, a basic game theoretic approach conceptualizes the survey
interview as a social interaction between the respondent and the
interviewer within the context of norms and mutual expectations. It is
argued that the respondent's choice to answer truthfully depends on (a)
the respondents' estimated likelihood that the interviewer honors trust
and (b) a relative comparison of the utility from conforming to ``the
norm of truthfulness{''} versus its costs. Finally, we review previous
empirical evidence and show that our theoretical model can explain both
successes and failures of the RRT.

N2  - Background: Text messaging systems are used to collect data on symptom
prevalence. Using a text messaging system, we evaluated the effects of
question load, question frequency, and financial incentive on response
rates and reported infant diarrhoea rates in an infant diarrhoea survey.
Methods: We performed a factorial cross-over randomised controlled trial
of an SMS surveying system for infant diarrhoea surveillance with
treatments: financial incentive (yes/no), question load
(1-question/3-question), and questioning frequency (daily/fortnightly).
Participants progressed through all treatment combinations over eight
two-week rounds. Data were analysed using multivariable logistic
regressions to determine the impacts of the treatments on the response
rates and reported diarrhoea rates. Attitudes were explored through
qualitative interviews.
Results: For the 141 participants, the mean response rate was 47%. In
terms of percentage point differences (ppd), daily questioning was
associated with a lower response rate than fortnightly (- 1 center dot
2{[}95%CI:-4 center dot 9,2 center dot 5]); high (3-question) question
loads were associated with a lower response rate than low (1-question)
question loads (- 7 center dot 0{[}95%CI:- 10 center dot 8,-3 center
dot 1]); and financial incentivisation was associated with a higher
response rate than no financial incentivisation (6 center dot
4{[}95%CI:2 center dot 6,10 center dot 2]).
The mean two-week diarrhoea rate was 36 center dot 4%. Daily
questioning was associated with a higher reported diarrhoea rate than
fortnightly (29 center dot 9{[}95%CI:22 center dot 8,36 center dot 9]);
with little evidence for impact by incentivisation or question load.
Conclusions: Close to half of all participants responded to the SMS
survey. Daily questioning evoked a statistically higher rate of reported
diarrhoea, while financial incentivisation and low (1-question) question
loads evoked higher response rates than no incentive and high
(3-question) question loads respectively.

N2  - Conservation science needs more high-quality impact evaluations,
especially ones that explore mechanisms of success or failure.
Randomized control trials (RCTs) provide particularly robust evidence of
the effectiveness of interventions (although they have been criticized
as reductionist and unable to provide insights into mechanisms), but
there have been few such experiments investigating conservation at the
landscape scale. We explored the impact of Watershared, an
incentive-based conservation program in the Bolivian Andes, with one of
the few RCTs of landscape-scale conservation in existence. There is
strong interest in such incentive-based conservation approaches as some
argue they can avoid negative social impacts sometimes associated with
protected areas. We focused on social and environmental outcomes based
on responses from a household survey in 129 communities randomly
allocated to control or treatment (conducted both at the baseline in
2010 and repeated in 2015-2016). We controlled for incomplete program
uptake by combining standard RCT analysis with matching methods and
investigated mechanisms by exploring intermediate and ultimate outcomes
according to the underlying theory of change. Previous analyses, focused
on single biophysical outcomes, showed that over its first 5 years
Watershared did not slow deforestation or improve water quality at the
landscape scale. We found that Watershared influenced some outcomes
measured using the survey, but the effects were complex, and some were
unexpected. We thus demonstrated how RCTs can provide insights into the
pathways of impact, as well as whether an intervention has impact. This
paper, one of the first registered reports in conservation science,
demonstrates how preregistration can help make complex research designs
more transparent, avoid cherry picking, and reduce publication bias.

N2  - Background Burnout is a substantial phenomenon across healthcare
settings, affecting more than half of healthcare professionals and
leading to negative patient and health system outcomes. Infusion center
professionals (ICPs) are at increased risk of burnout attributed to high
patient volume and acuity levels. Strategies to address burnout have
been developed and prioritized by the American Medical Association
(AMA), the World Health Organization, and other organizations. Aims This
quality improvement project aimed to address perceived burnout,
job-related stress, and job satisfaction among nurses, physician
assistants, and medical assistants at a large pediatric hospital through
integration of two infusion center (IC)-based staff engagement
interventions. Methods A pre- and post-test study design was used.
Existing team huddles in the IC were modified based on the AMA STEPS
Forward program recommendations to incorporate appreciative inquiry and
recognition into team and department events. Peer recognition was
tailored toward institutional core values. The Mini-Z Burnout survey was
administered before and 3 months after implementation of both
interventions. Findings Pre- to post-intervention responses revealed a
higher percentage of staff reporting no burnout (57.7% vs. 75%), low
levels of job-related stress (58.8% vs. 65.5%), and satisfaction with
current job (70.6% vs. 82.8%). Most participants agreed or strongly
agreed that structured huddles (69%) and recognition events (82.8%)
were beneficial and recommended continuation (65.5% and 82.8%,
respectively). Open-ended responses regarding workplace stressors
focused heavily on staffing and patient acuity. Linking Evidence to
Action Project outcomes support the integration of tailored
interventions to reduce burnout among pediatric ICPs. Organizational
commitment to addressing burnout can provide incentive to scale up
institution-wide staff engagement interventions. Further study is needed
to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of such tailored
interventions across diverse settings.

N2  - Overharvesting of terrestrial and marine resources may be alleviated by
encouraging an alternative configuration of livelihoods, particularly in
rural communities in developing countries. Typical occupations in such
areas include fishing and farming, and rural households often switch
livelihood activities to suit climate and economic conditions. We used a
machine-learning tool, deep-belief networks (DBN), and data from surveys
of a rural Philippine coastal community to examine household desire to
change livelihood. This desire is affected by a variety of factors, such
as income, family needs, and feelings of work satisfaction, that are
interrelated in complex ways. In farming households, livelihood changes
often occur to diversify resources, increase income, and lessen economic
risk. The DBN, given its multilayer perceptron structure, has a capacity
to model nonlinear relationships among factors while providing an
acceptable degree of accuracy. Relative to a set of 34 features (e.g.,
education, boat ownership, and work satisfaction), we examined the
binary response variables desire to change work or not to change work.
The best network had a test set accuracy of 97.5%. Among the features,
7 significantly affected desire to shift work: ethnicity, work
satisfaction, number of persons in a household in ill health, number of
fighting cocks owned, fishing engagement, buy-and-sell revenue, and
educational level. A cross-correlation matrix of these 7 features
indicated households less inclined to change work were those engaged in
fishing and retail buying and selling. For fishing, provision of
economic and other incentives should be considered to encourage changing
from this occupation to allow recovery of fishery resources.

N2  - Do partisan disagreements over politically relevant facts, and
preferences for the information sources from which to obtain them,
represent genuine differences of opinion or insincere cheerleading? The
answer to this question is crucial for understanding the scope of
partisan polarization. We test between these alternatives with
experiments that offer incentives for correct survey responses and allow
respondents to search for information before answering each question. We
find that partisan cheerleading inflates divides in factual information,
but only modestly. Incentives have no impact on partisan divides in
information search; these divides are no different from those that occur
outside the survey context when we examine web-browsing data from the
same respondents. Overall, our findings support the motivated reasoning
interpretation of misinformation; partisans seek out information with
congenial slant and sincerely adopt inaccurate beliefs that cast their
party in a favorable light.

population consisted of 222 patient safety officers, that is, health
care professionals with strategic positions in patient safety work in
the county councils. A postal questionnaire was used for data
collection. Results The survey response rate was 70%. The factors that
were considered most important for the current level of patient safety
were efforts to reduce the use of antibiotics; Swedish patient safety
law; and internal discussions with the county council management, heads
of health care units, health care providers, and so on. The factors that
were considered most important to achieve safer care in the future were
improved communication between health care practitioners and patients,
improved organizational culture, improved communication, and patient
safety knowledge as a compulsory component of basic education for health
care practitioners. Conclusions Several factors rated highly for
achieving the current level of patient safety are part of the
government-supported financial incentive plan. Patient safety is
attributed to a broad range of factors, and many solutions might
contribute to improved patient safety in the future. The most successful
county councils are characterized by leadership support for patient
safety, well-organized patient safety work, long-term commitment to
patient safety, and an organizational culture that is conducive to
patient safety.

web-based questionnaires within mixed-mode designs but none used it as
the sole mode. In the context of future EHIS, the response rate and net
sample composition of a web-only approach was tested. Methods: A Belgian
study with a target sample size of 1000 (age: 16-85) was organized using
the EHIS wave 3 model questionnaire. The sample was selected according
to a multistage, clustered sampling procedure with geographical
stratification. Field substitution was applied; non-participating
households were replaced by similar households regarding statistical
sector, sex and age. There was one reminder letter and a (sic)10
conditional incentive. Results: Considering all substitutions, a 16%
response rate was obtained after sending one reminder. Elderly, Brussels
Capital inhabitants, people living without a partner and those with a
non-Belgian nationality were less responding. By design, there were no
differences between the initial and final net sample regarding
substitution characteristics. Nevertheless, people living without a
partner, non-Belgians and lower educated people remain underrepresented.
Conclusion: There was a low response rate, particularly for some
population groups. The response rate was lower than those of MS using
mixedmode designs including web, especially these comprising
interviewer-based approaches. Despite the long and complex
questionnaire, there was a low break off rate. So far, web-only data
collection is not an acceptable strategy for population-based health
surveys but efforts to increase the response should be further explored.

N2  - With increased construction activities in capital cities of Australia,
the sustainable management of construction and demolition (C&D) has
become an important item in the federal and state government agendas.
According to the universally accepted concept of waste hierarchy waste
disposal is the worst preferred waste management option due to
environmental issues. Currently, in most Australian jurisdictions, a
landfill levy is applied to discourage waste disposal and to further
encourage waste recovery. However, there is an ongoing debate as to
whether the levy regime could achieve the desired outcome. Therefore,
this study, funded by the Australian Sustainable Built Environment
National Research Centre, explored the effectiveness of the current
landfill levy across Australian jurisdictions. The paper presents the
findings of this study that were obtained from a questionnaire survey
aiming to capture the main C&D waste management stakeholders on
landfill taxing imposition in Australia. The study collected 132
responses from professionals in the construction industry and other
industries dealing with C&D waste management and resource recovery. The
results demonstrated that those who believed in market incentive
approaches outweigh people that were in favour of pecuniary impost
approach. Among those who favoured pecuniary imposts, almost 90% of
participants agreed with the effectiveness of landfill levies in any
waste management system. Other results provided a useful insight into
the actual implications of the current levy scheme. It is expected that
the findings in this study contribute to developing sound policies that
provide a level field for all key stakeholders and to ensure that
resource recovery is further encouraged.

N2  - The IT-enabled sharing economy has enabled the taxi to become an
Internet product, forming a popular new phenomenon in people's daily
lives and creating new roles for employees. How the Internet taxi
drivers' work engagement is influenced in the context of the IT-enabled
sharing economy has become an interesting new area for IS researchers to
explore. Although monetary rewards are important for employees' behavior
and performance, extant studies primarily emphasize the crowding-out and
crowding-in effects of financial incentives, rather than the influencing
mechanism. This article prospects and develops theoretically the effects
of monetary rewards and workplace spirituality on work engagement and
demonstrates these effects empirically. An analysis of 35 semistructured
interviews revealed three intrinsic motivators: stress reduction, job
autonomy, and self-efficacy. We propose a structural model based upon
motivation crowding theory. Responses to 235 survey responses showed
that work engagement can be improved by providing monetary rewards and
enhancing workplace spirituality through intrinsic motivators. This
research contributes to exploring the mediating role of intrinsic
motivators, extends motivation crowding theory to a new research field,
and provides a new perspective on work engagement in the context of the
IT-enabled sharing economy. Our findings extend the previous research
associated with workplace spirituality and the existing knowledge of
operations management from the perspective of labor intensity and
trade-off between inputs and outputs.

N2  - Incentive-based demand response (DR) policy plays an important role in
guiding residents' electricity consumption behavior. How to effectively
implement the DR policy has become a scientific issue that needs to be
addressed urgently. To this end, based on the data from large-scale DR
trials and matching questionnaires, the policy implementation path has
been analyzed. The results show that households responded to the DR
policy saved 0.09 kW h more electricity in the 1.5-h response period
than households that did not respond to the DR policy. On the management
implementation side, the subsidy price is crucial. Community publicity
can also enhance the electricity saving effect. It also has been found
that the electricity-saving potential of the low-level community is
relatively limited. On the households' response side, households with
higher household incomes, younger income earners, more air conditioners
and small appliances, and higher gas consumption have higher policy
participation. The novelty and originality of this article is that the
data collected through large-scale controlled trials are unique and
valuable. And we creatively combined trial data and surveys data
together, which will enable us to further explore the
implementation-side management factors and response-side household
attributes. At the end, we put forward systematic policy recommendations
for the implementation of DR policy, which has important references
significance for countries with similar regulated electricity markets.

N2  - Internet surveys of American Evaluation Association (AEA) members are a
common method for studying evaluation practice. Response rates obtained
from Internet surveys of AEA members are, however, frequently very
small. To investigate whether or not material incentives increase
response rates to Internet surveys of AEA members, a between-subjects
three-treatment and one control randomized experiment in which a
randomly selected sample of AEA members were randomly assigned to a
no-incentive control condition, lottery condition, token incentive
condition, or philanthropic donation incentive condition was utilized.
The overall response rate to the survey was 39.66% and the response
rates for each of the four conditions were control = 36.24%, lottery =
44.39%, token incentive = 43.28%, and philanthropic donation =
34.67%, respectively. The cost-effectiveness of each of the four
conditions also was examined, demonstrating that the lottery was the
most cost-effective. Other factors potentially influencing response or
nonresponse decisions also are discussed.

N2  - Background Pharmaceutical companies and regulatory agencies endeavor to
relate their decision making with outcomes to improve future decision
making and to ensure that gained knowledge is fed back into a learning
system. Nevertheless, such a correlation can only be achieved by
documenting the expected outcome of a decision at the time it is made,
enabling comparison of the expected outcome with the actual result.
Methods Participants at an international workshop discussed how the
documentation of decisions could be evolved as companies and agencies
look to improve their knowledge base. Discussions were informed by a
pre-workshop survey of pharmaceutical companies and regulatory agencies.
Results Most survey participants from 12 companies (55% response rate)
and 11 agencies (73% response) have a system in place to enable
documentation of major decisions, however, systems are used primarily to
document outcomes rather than the process, while information from
documentation is not always used, and feedback loops are not in place.
The majority of participants indicated that their organization currently
documents most decision-making practices included in the proposed
template. Workshop participants agreed that all major past decisions
should be referenceable and suggested incentives to enable decisions to
be referenced, and confirmed elements and characteristics of a
decision-documentation template. Conclusions This survey and workshop
identified the current landscape and gaps in the documentation of
decision making and suggested revisions for a proposed documentation
template. The use of technology to enable information extraction with
support from artificial intelligence and future decision making was a
recommendation highlighted by participants.

N2  - Purpose Collaborative contracting (CC) is the direction that Singapore
is venturing into in line with the Construction Industry Transformation
Map. For its successful adoption, it is necessary to examine the
potential barriers and possible solutions. Therefore, this study aims to
explore the current status, major barriers and best solutions for the
adoption of CC in the Singapore construction industry.
Design/methodology/approach To achieve these objectives, a comprehensive
literature review was carried out and 26 barriers, as well as 21
solutions, were identified. Then a questionnaire was designed to assess
the priority of these barriers and solutions. After a pilot study, 165
questionnaires were distributed, and 31 responses were received. And the
survey result was validated by post-survey with three industry
professionals. Findings Results revealed that only a small percent of
projects adopted CC in Singapore. Seven significant barriers hindering
CC implementation were found out. They are ``inherent difficulties in
changing organizational culture,{''} ``lack of incentives/financial
support,{''} ``lack of legislative regulations,{''} ``resistant to
change the current way of working,{''} ``seeking for the lowest cost{''}
and ``difficulties in converting strategic decisions to operational
levels{''} and ``unclear contract terms and objectives.{''} Also, five
best solutions were suggested to overcome the identified barriers.
Originality/value The findings of this study could enable industry
practitioners to be aware of the potential barriers to adopting CC and
choose suitable solutions to overcome these barriers. It is also helpful
for authorities to come up with effective policies to promote the
adoption of CC.

N2  - Aim
In surveys non-responders may introduce bias and lower the validity of
the studies. Ways to increase response rates are therefore important.
The purpose of the study was to investigate if an unconditional monetary
incentive can increase the response rate for vulnerable children and
youths in a postal questionnaire survey.
Methods
The study was designed as a randomized controlled trial. The study
population consisted of 262 children and youth who participated in an
established intervention study aimed at creating networks for different
groups of vulnerable children and youths. The mean age of the
participants was 16.7 years (range 11-28) and 67.9% were female. The
questionnaire was adapted to three different age groups and covered
different aspects of the participants' life situation, including the
dimensions from the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). In
the follow-up survey, participants were randomly allocated to two groups
that either received a (sic)15 voucher for a supermarket together with
the questionnaire or only received the questionnaire. We used Poisson
regression to estimate the differences in response rate (Rate Ratio RR)
between the intervention group and the control group.
Results
The response rate was 75.5% in the intervention group and 42.9% in the
control group. The response rate in the intervention group was
significantly higher than in the control group when adjusting for age
and gender (Rate Ratio, RR 1.73; 95% CI 1.38-2.17). We did not find any
significant differences in scales scores between the two groups for the
five scales of the SDQ. In stratified analyses, we found the effect of
the incentive to be higher for males (RR 2.81; 95% CI 1.61-4.91) than
for females (1.43; 95% CI 1.12-1.84).
Conclusions
Monetary incentives can increase the response rate for vulnerable
children and youths in surveys.

N2  - OBJECTIVES The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Nursing
Home Quality Initiative aims to improve quality through performance
measurement. We describe quality improvement (QI) changes that skilled
nursing facilities (SNFs) reported making in response to CMS performance
measurements and whether reported QI changes were associated with better
performance on CMS performance measures.
DESIGN Nationally representative survey.
SETTING A total of 15,475 SNFs that reported quality performance on
Nursing Home Compare in 2016.
PARTICIPANTS A total of 1,182 SNFs (58% of random sample of 2,045
SNFs).
MEASUREMENTS Adoption of 22 possible QI changes, grouped into seven
categories (organizational culture, health information technology, care
process redesign, provider incentives, changes to staffing
responsibilities, performance monitoring, and measure-specific QI
initiatives and technical assistance); performance on the CMS Nursing
Home Compare Five-Star Quality Rating System's quality measure rating.
RESULTS SNFs reported making an average of 13 QI changes (interquartile
range = 11-16 changes). SNFs mostly commonly reported becoming a
learning organization (87%) and providing training to staff on QI
strategies (87%). After controlling for patient and facility
characteristics, larger SNFs were more likely to obtain assistance on
measure reporting from QI organizations and use provider champions than
smaller SNFs by 14 and 11 percentage points, respectively. Rural SNFs
and SNFs with higher proportions of disabled, black, or Hispanic
residents adopted QI changes at similar rates as other SNFs. Of the 22
QI changes, 20 were considered at least somewhat helpful by more than
80% of adopting SNFs. Implementation of all 22 QI changes (vs no
changes) was associated with a .48-star higher quality measure rating
(95% confidence interval = .003-.98 stars; P = .05).
CONCLUSION In response to CMS measurement programs, SNFs reported making
substantial QI investments that were associated with better performance
on CMS quality measures. To guide future SNF investments in QI, work is
needed to identify the QI changes that yield the greatest performance
improvements.

N2  - A firm's decision on whether to choose the same auditor as a close
competitor reflects a trade-off between exercising caution to protect
its proprietary information and pursuing the benefits of auditor
knowledge derived from providing services to comparable clients. We
conduct a survey of audit partners whose responses confirm that clients
weigh these competing incentives when selecting an external auditor.
Building on our survey evidence from very experienced practitioners, we
empirically analyze this phenomenon using archival data. Employing a
pairwise similarity measure based on descriptions from regulatory
filings, we find that, on average, peer firms are more likely to engage
the same auditor when their product offerings are more similar. In
instances when the focal firm shares the same auditor with more similar
peer firms, the focal firm benefits from enhanced audit quality while
also paying lower audit fees. Despite these benefits, we find that peer
firms are less likely to share auditors with rivals in settings with
greater perceived costs of information leakage as well as embedded
auditor-client relationships in which the auditor retains deep client
knowledge. Collectively, we provide evidence that, although the upside
stemming from auditor knowledge, on average, dominates the downside of
greater vulnerability to information leakage, proprietary cost concerns
motivate firms to deviate from seeking auditor expertise. (C) 2020

N2  - Purpose Given the increasing importance of political decision-making to
reduce emission targets, the main purpose of the current paper is to
identify and test the considerations that would nudge consumers towards
an environmentally and health-friendly motor vehicle. Methods An online
survey was conducted to assess public responses and the role of public
authorities to a voluntary emission standard for passenger cars. In
addition, two online experiments were conducted to test incentives in
the design of ecolabels (e.g. price, safety, performance) for
optimization. A random sample of 6400 individuals was drawn from eight
countries: Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, UK, Czech
Republic and Lithuania. An online survey was conducted among 3200
respondents, 400 in each of the 8 countries, and 2 online experiments
with 3200 subjects, 400 in each of the 8 countries, allowing for 200
respondents for each experiment in each country. Results and discussion
The survey shows that Europeans are aware of the health and
environmental impact of cars. The findings also confirm the gap between
self-reported attitudes/intentions and actual behaviours. In influencing
car purchase decisions, health and environmental concerns are less
important than other attributes such as price, safety and performance.
The experiments show that all these attributes have a significant effect
on consumers' choices. However, message content was found to have the
strongest effect. Respondents are more likely to choose European Union
Low Emitting carS (EULES)-friendly cars when the label shows information
on lower costs or lower taxes and less likely to be influenced by
health-related benefits, convenient parking or access fees. Finally,
combinations of one message with other elements-EULES logo, CO2 logo or
both-within the same label have a small but positive effect on
respondents' choices. Conclusions The findings of this study assist
governmental decision-making processes by identifying those issues that
have the greatest impact on consumers' car purchasing decisions.
Furthermore, the results will help to guide environmentally conscious
customers towards the purchase of vehicles with clean emission profiles.

N2  - Recent years have seen a growth in energy research that integrates
social and behavioural sciences. A core component of this work involves
collecting human data, commonly via surveys and field experiments. But
there are often barriers to recruiting large and representative samples
of participants, with sampling bias and non-response error posing
threats to validity. Identifying cost-effective ways to increase
participation in energy research is therefore important for
strengthening the rigor, utility and generalisability of studies in this
area. To this end, the current study harnesses an experimental design to
test pathways for making energy surveys more impactful - specifically by
improving response rates and times, lowering sampling bias, and
enhancing overall cost-effectiveness. As part of a postal survey on
household energy use in Australia, a set of randomised controlled trials
were conducted to test the impact of four strategies: incentives, an
envelope message, a handwritten sticky note, and a reminder postcard. A
3 x 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design was applied to assess both individual and
interactive effects. While material incentives in the form of an upfront
token gift and prize draw were ineffective in improving response
relative to the control survey, results revealed that a handwritten
sticky note expressing upfront thanks for participating - designed to
serve as an intrinsically motivating attentional cue - improved both the
rate and timeliness of response. Three combinations of strategies
yielded significantly higher response rates than the control, but they
were more expensive on a `dollar cost per response' basis. Implications
for research and practice are discussed.

N2  - Background
The HIV epidemiology in South Africa reveals stark age and gender
disparities, with young women being the most vulnerable to HIV
acquisition in 2017. Evaluation of HIV exposure is a challenge in HIV
prevention research. Intermittent in-clinic interviewer-administered
risk behaviour assessments are utilised but may be limited by social
desirability and recall biases. We piloted a mobile phone application
for daily self-report of sexual risk behaviour in fifty 18-25 year old
women at risk of HIV infection enrolled in HIV Vaccine Trials Network
915 (HVTN 915) in Soweto, South Africa. Through a mixed-methods
investigation, we explored barriers and facilitators to completing daily
mobile phone surveys among HVTN 915 study participants and staff.
Methods
We analysed quantitative data on barriers and facilitators to mobile
phone study completion collected during the larger HVTN 915 study as
well as two post-study focus group discussions (FGDs) with fifteen
former participants with a median age of 24 years (IQR 23-25) and six
individual in-depth interviews (IDIs) with HVTN 915 staff. FGDs and IDIs
utilised semi-structured interview guides, were audio-recorded,
transcribed verbatim and translated to English. After coding, thematic
analysis was performed.
Results
The main facilitator for daily mobile phone survey completion assessed
across 336 follow-up visits for 49 participants was the daily short
message system (SMS) reminders (93%, 312/336). Across 336 visits, 31/49
(63%) retained participants reported barriers to completion of daily
mobile phone surveys: forgetting (20%, 12/49), being too busy (19%,
11/49) and the survey being an inconvenience (15%, 9/49). Five main
themes were identified during the coding of IDIs and FGDs: (1)
facilitators of mobile phone survey completion, such as daily SMS
reminders and follow up calls for non-completers; (2) barriers to mobile
phone survey completion, including partner, time-related and technical
barriers; (3) power of incentives; (4) response bias in providing
sensitive information, and (5) recommendations for future mobile phone
based interventions.
Conclusion
Despite our enthusiasm to use innovation to optimise sexual risk
assessments, technical and practical solutions are required to improve
implementation. We recommend further engagement with participants to
optimise this approach and to further understand social desirability
bias and study incentives in sexual risk reporting.

N2  - In order for humans to achieve a healthier diet and maintain ecological
balance, a new concept regarding sustainable food has been introduced.
The aim of this study is, therefore, to explore consumers' interest in
choosing sustainable food. The study utilized ``Do Survey,{''} an
internet survey platform, to distribute questionnaires. Survey
invitations were sent out in a snowball manner. Invitations were posted
in multiple online communities and forwarded by various members to other
sites; 333 valid responses were collected. The results show that family
and friend support and health incentive are the two strongest predictors
for sustainable food buying interest. Price accessibility, on the other
hand, has no impact on interest. This is not to say that price
accessibility does not influence behavior. It just means that it is not
the factor that fosters interest. Once an individual is interested,
she/he may still rely heavily on price accessibility in purchasing
sustainable food.

N2  - Area wide management (AWM) is a coordinated strategy designed to achieve
effective and longer-lasting suppression of mobile insect pests,
involving groups of commercial growers working together and/or with
local communities to achieve control across multiple host areas. In this
study, we hypothesised that intentions to carry out AWM for the control
of fruit fly would be predicted by subjective knowledge of insect pests,
along with protection motivation factors (perceived pest threat
severity, threat vulnerability, self-efficacy, AWM response efficacy and
response costs). Fruit and vegetable growers (n = 131) and general
public (n = 896) living in fruit-growing regions completed a large-scale
telephone survey, measuring perceptions and intentions to implement area
wide management. Regression analyses tested the relationship between
intention, protection motivation factors and subjective knowledge, F(8,
1018) = 48.52, p < .001, yielding a statistically significant predictive
model accounting for approximately 30% of behavioural variance in
intention. Self-efficacy, threat severity, response efficacy and threat
vulnerability were the most influential predictors of intention.
Subjective knowledge was not a strong predictor, but results did clarify
that explicit knowledge of fruit fly controls, rather than tacit
knowledge of fruit fly itself, was a significant predictor of intention.
Understanding motivational drivers for farmer and community engagement
in pest management can not only help predict uptake of novel practices,
but also allude to how individual farmers and communities are
articulating a pest problem. The importance of explanatory factors such
as threat appraisal and self-efficacy in framing management activities
can help to better target behavioural incentives.

JF  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
DO  - 10.1007/s10551-020-04502-8
N2  - In this study, we reconcile conflicting findings from the extant
literature on the impact of tax system parameters on tax noncompliance.
We argue that social norms play a role of heuristics facilitating tax
payers' response to the instrumental incentives posed by the systemic
parameters, such as tax rate and penalties for evasion, and thus
moderate the effect of those parameters on willingness to evade taxes.
Relying on a unique survey experiment conducted in fourteen countries of
Central-Eastern Europe, we demonstrate two types of a conditioning
effect of norms. First, the impact of tax rates on respondents'
propensity for tax evasion is moderated by the perceived norms of the
society at large (descriptive norms). In particular, an increasing tax
rate lowers the probability of evasion as long as one views ``most
others{''} as honest taxpayers, which highlights the importance of
equitability (fairness) concerns for tax compliance decisions. In
contrast, the impact of punishment is moderated by the perceived norms
of one's immediate reference group (subjective norms). Strong subjective
compliance norms tend to effectively replace penalties as a mechanism
discouraging tax evasion, suggesting that the deterrent effect of a
penalty can be entirely suppressed when subjective norms are strong.
These findings have important implications for the understanding of tax
compliance decisions under different formal and informal regimes.

N2  - Traditional survey research faces declining response rates due to
changing cultural habits and technological developments. Researchers
have developed novel approaches to increase respondents' likelihood of
participating in web surveys. However, we lack information about whether
these methods indeed increase response rates and, if so, whether they
bias the resulting data. This article focuses on the use of nonmaterial
incentives in the form of a video that provides the invitees with
information tailored to their life situation. Analysis of our
experimental data shows that instead of increasing respondents'
probability of starting the survey, the video treatments actually
decrease it. We provide evidence that the lower salience of the
intrinsic benefits of survey participation in the invitation email
significantly contributes to this reduction. Additionally, the effect of
the nonmaterial incentive differs across subgroups, affecting
nonresponse biases in line with employment status, gender, and migration
background. We therefore conclude that using additional information in
the form of a video as a nonmaterial survey incentive is only suitable
under specific conditions.

decline in response rates, which has posed numerous challenges for
researchers, most notably concerns about nonresponse bias. We present
results from three studies conducted in an attempt to increase response
rates and reduce nonresponse bias for a U.S. national household survey.
We examined design features related to mode (i.e., mail-only vs.
web-push), incentive, reminder type, nonresponse follow-up, and
messaging. Results showed that a combination of a mail-only approach and
the use of US$2 prepaid incentives increased response rates. However,
using incentives did not bring into the respondent pool sample members
who were less likely to respond. Additionally, we found that the use of
a seventh follow-up contact only slightly increased response rates.
Finally, we found that the use of a friendly message not only suppressed
response rates but also increased potential nonresponse bias for sample
members aged 35-48.

N2  - Background
Successive health system reforms have steadily eroded physician
autonomy. Escalating accountability demands placed on physicians
concurrent with diminishing autonomy plus widespread ``cost cutting{''}
endanger clinical work-life quality and, in turn, threaten patient-care
quality, safety, and continuity. This has engendered a renewed emphasis
on bettering physician work-life to safeguard patient care. Research
indicates that autonomy support could be an effective intervention point
in this dynamic, and that improving healthcare practitioners' experience
of autonomy can promote better patient outcomes. New measures of
autonomy support towards physicians during systemic/organizational
transformation are thus needed.
Objective
We investigated the validity and reliability of two versions of a brief
measure of physicians' perceptions of autonomy support.
Design
Psychometric evaluation of practitioners' responses to a theory-based,
pilot-tested, multi-center, cross-sectional survey-questionnaire.
Participants
Physicians serving in California, Massachusetts, or upstate New York
clinical practices implementing pay-for-performance incentives were
eligible. We obtained responses from 1,534 (35.14%) of 4,365 physicians
surveyed.
Analysis
We randomly partitioned the study sample equitably into derivation and
validation subsamples. We conducted parallel analysis,
inter-item/point-biserial correlations, and item-response-theory-based
graded response modeling on six autonomy support items. Three items with
the highest (a) point-biserial correlations, (b) item-level
discrimination and (c) information capture were used to construct a
short-form (3-item) version of the full (6-item) autonomy scale. We
utilized exploratory structural equation modeling and confirmatory
factor analysis to establish the factor structure and construct validity
of the full-length and short-form scales before comparing their factor
invariance, reliability and interrater agreement across physician
subgroups.
Findings
All six autonomy support items loaded highly onto one factor accounting
for the majority of variance and demonstrating good data fit. The three
most discriminating and informative items loaded equally well onto a
single factor with similar goodness-of-fit to the data. The three-item
scale correlated highly with its six-item parent, showing equally high
sensitivity and specificity in discriminating high autonomy support.
Variability in scores nested predominantly at within- rather than
between-subgroup levels.
Conclusions and implications
Our data supported the factor structure, construct validity, internal
consistency, and reliability of six- and three-item autonomy support
scales. These brief tools are easily incorporated into multi-dimensional
questionnaires at relatively low cost.

This research examined how Australian construction projects perform in
the area of client-led innovation. The purpose of this paper is to test
the influence of a set of enablers in promoting the innovative
performance of construction projects and examine how Australian
construction projects perform in relation to innovation.
Design/methodology/approach
A questionnaire was developed and distributed to over 300 construction
industry practitioners to obtain perceptions of industry practitioners
regarding client-led enablers to promoting innovation at the project
level, with 131 valid responses received. The data from the survey were
subjected to statistical analyses including mean comparisons, using the

Findings
This research identified a number of enablers that clients can employ in
construction projects to enhance innovative performance. It also
revealed that the innovative performance of construction projects in
Australia appears to be above average, although the perceived level is
not too high. The main finding of the research is that Australian
clients could achieve higher outcomes from construction projects by
promoting innovativeness in their projects, especially by promoting
innovativeness in their own organizations and providing
incentives/rewards and other support for innovative activities in
projects.
Originality/value
Past research focusing on client-led enablers at the project level is
limited. This research identified a number of enablers that clients can
employ to achieve greater benefits from their projects through
innovation.

N2  - Background: The nursing workforce is critical for the provision of
quality health-care and positive patient outcomes. There is a global
trend of migration of nurses from under-developed to developed countries
due to attractive job offers in the host countries. Lebanon presents
such a case where nurses are migrating abroad, leading to shortages in
the nursing workforce in their home country.
Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate reasons for the
migration of Lebanese nurses, and incentives that would attract them
back to their home country in order to enhance the nursing workforce in
Lebanon.
Design: This study is a cross-sectional survey of emigrant Lebanese
nurses.
Settings: Recipient countries where Lebanese nurses emigrated.
Participants: 440 Emigrant Lebanese nurses were identified through the
registration database of the Order of Nurses in Lebanon. The survey was
sent to all of them via email; 153 responses were received.
Methods: Data were collected from November 2017 to March 2018. Analysis
included univariate and bivariate tests to present descriptive
statistics of the respondents, and to examine region of residence and
gender in relation to their current job satisfaction, reasons for
leaving Lebanon, intention to return to Lebanon, and aspects that would
attract them back to their home country. Logistic regression analysis
was used to determine the socio-demographic and work-related
characteristics associated with the odds of returning to practice
nursing in Lebanon.
Results: A total 136 completed responses were considered. Emigrant
Lebanese nurses were highly educated, with more years of work
experience, and older than nurses remaining in their home country. Top
reasons for nurses to leave Lebanon included unsatisfactory salary or
benefits, better work opportunities in other countries, and lack of
professional development or career advancement. The majority of surveyed
nurses (59%) expressed willingness to return to practice nursing in
Lebanon. Aspects that would attract emigrant Lebanese nurses back to
their home country include attractive salary or better benefits and
opportunities for professional development, career advancement, or
continuing education. Emigrant Lebanese nurses residing in the Gulf,
staff nurses, and nurses with more years of work experience were more
likely to return to practice nursing in Lebanon.
Conclusion: Highly educated and experienced nurses are departing from
Lebanon. This presents a challenge for the less experienced nurses
remaining in the country, who could benefit from the mentorship and
experience of their migrating peers. Creating an environment that could
enhance the professional development of nurses in Lebanon, with
financial incentives could retain the nursing workforce in the country.

N2  - Rationale and Objective: To review response rates published in medical
imaging journals, and to analyze potential factors which contributed to
a low response rate.
Materials and Methods: A literature search was performed in MEDLINE and
Embase to identify and assess published medical imaging survey studies.
Variables assessed were response rate, incentives such as reminders and
remuneration, and rationales provided for a potential low response rate.
Statistical significance was calculated using unpaired t tests, ANOVA,
Mann-Whitney, and Kruskal-Wallis tests.
Results: Three hundred and fifty-six unique surveys were included for
analysis. The mean survey response rate in the current age of
predominately electronic surveys was 45%. Factors which statistically
significantly demonstrated a difference in response rate were survey
location (European countries: 52%, Canada: 47%, United States: 42%; p
< 0.05), survey topic (musculoskeletal: 69%, nuclear medicine: 64%,
and education: 47%; p < 0.05), survey delivery method (telephone: 76%,
email: 41%; p < 0.0001), and survey question type (short answer: 62%,
multiple choice: 43%; p < 0.01). Statistically significant linear
correlations were observed between the response rate compared to the
number of reminders sent (r = 0.27; p < 0.01) and the number of
participants (r = -0.26; p < 0.0001).
Conclusion: The survey response rate serves as a surrogate marker for
non-response bias. Survey response controlled for intrinsic
nonadjustable characteristics offer achievable research goals.
Adjustable factors to low response, including survey delivery method,
question type, and number of reminders demonstrated statistical
difference in response rate, and can be utilized by researchers to
prospectively minimize nonresponse bias.

N2  - To improve access to maternal health services, Benin introduced in 2009
a user fee exemption policy for caesarean sections. Similar to other
low- and middle-income countries, its implementation showed mixed
results. Our study aimed at understanding why and in which circumstances
the implementation of this policy in hospitals succeeded or failed. We
adopted the realist evaluation approach and tested the initial programme
theory through a multiple embedded case study design. We selected two
hospitals with contrastive outcomes. We used data from 52
semi-structured interviews, a patient exit survey, a costing study of
caesarean section and an analysis of financial flows. In the analysis,
we used the intervention-context-actor-mechanism-outcome configuration
heuristic. We identified two main causal pathways. First, in the
state-owned hospital, which has a public-oriented but administrative
management system, and where citizens demand accountability through
various channels, the implementation process was effective. In the
non-state-owned hospital, managers were guided by organizational
financial interests more than by the inherent social value of the
policy, there was a perceived lack of enforcement and the implementation
was poor. We found that trust, perceived coercion, adherence to policy
goals, perceived financial incentives and fairness in their allocation
drive compliance, persuasion, positive responses to incentives and
self-efficacy at the operational level to generate the policy
implementation outcomes. Compliance with the policy depended on
enforcement by hierarchical authority and bottom-up pressure. Persuasion
depended on the alignment of the policy with personal and organizational
values. Incentives may determine the adoption if they influence the
local stakeholder's revenue are trustworthy and perceived as fairly
allocated. Failure to anticipate the differential responses of
implementers will prevent the proper implementation of user fee
exemption policies and similar universal health coverage reforms.

N2  - Purpose: The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a challenge.
CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) for suspected PE has become the primary
imaging modality, but concerns regarding overutilization, overdiagnosis,
radiation, and costs have led to algorithms that combine a clinical
decision rule (CDR) and highly sensitive D-dimer to identify patients in
whom PE can be safely excluded without further studies. This has been
identified as a top five Choosing Wisely recommendation in pulmonary
medicine, but adherence is modest at best and actual utilization is
unknown. Therefore, a survey was conducted to determine the prevalence
of this approach in the Veterans Administration (VA) healthcare system.
Methods: A web-based questionnaire survey (SurveyGizmo.com) was
developed and validated to query the utilization of CDR +/- D-dimer in
suspected PE. Key stakeholders identified from national VA mailing lists
of radiology, pulmonary, and emergency medicine chiefs were sent an
email describing the survey and provided a link for response. This study
was reviewed and approved by our local institutional review board and
accessing the link represented consent for participation. No personally
identifiable data were collected and a drawing for a gift card was
provided as an incentive.
Results: There were a total of 159 responses, with 120 fully completed
surveys for analysis. The majority of respondents were chiefs (63%)
with 11 + years of experience (80%), from hospitals with house staff
(86%) and an emergency department (97%). Respondents were from
emergency medicine (31%), pulmonary (27%), radiology (26%), and other
departments (9%). The overwhelming majority of respondents (85%) did
not require results of a CDR +/- D-dimer before ordering a CTPA. Only
6.7% required a CDR + D-dimer, with others requiring either only a CDR
(5.8%) or D-dimer (2.5%). The most common CDR was the Wells score,
with only one using the Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria. Nine of 18
(50%) regional Veterans Integrated Service Networks reported at least
one site requiring a CDR before CTPA. An average of 9.6 CTPAs were
estimated to be performed per week. Sorted by CDR and D-dimer use, 8
(CDR + D-dimer), 6.9 (CDR only), 8 (D-dimer only), 10.1 (no
requirements) CTPA studies were performed weekly. The average CTPA yield
for PE was estimated at 11.9% (CDR + D-dimer), 8% (CDR only), 2.5%
(D-dimer only), and 7.6% (no requirements).
Conclusions: The vast majority of hospitals within the VA system do not
use a CDR +/- D-dimer in the evaluation of patients with suspected PE.
Utilization of a CDR and D-dimer may decrease CTPA utilization and
increase yield, but this assessment is limited by the scope of the
survey.
Clinical Implications: CDR-guided strategies are recommended in the
evaluation of suspected PE. Adherence within the VA healthcare system is
very low. Further investigation is warranted to better characterize and
improve the adherence to CDR-guided strategies and CTPA utilization.

N2  - Landscapes are changing, with rural areas becoming increasingly
urbanized. Children and adolescents are underrepresented in the
sense-of-place literature. Our study aimed to understand how adolescent
residents of a rural-urban transition area perceive and value their
urbanizing landscape by examining sense of place and perceptions of
landscape change. A Public Participation GIS approach, accompanied by a
questionnaire survey, was applied to elicit responses from a sample of
747 students aged 12-18 in Colmenar Viejo, Madrid (Spain). Respondents'
sense of ``self-in-place{''} or home range was small, around 1 km,
although valued places were identified up to around 17 km away, and
occasionally further afield. Most responses were associated with urban
land, with clear difference between the urban core, strongly associated
with emotions, and the suburbs, with activities. Functional locations
(i.e. sports facilities) and places which were valued for their social
meaning (i.e. shopping malls), could be differentiated. Students were
perceptive about change processes in the urban area, but not about those
on the peripheral semi-natural land. Younger children were less aware
than older children of spaces outside of the town and carried out fewer
activities there. Females carried out fewer outdoor activities than male
adolescents. In contrast to the adult population, students were more
strongly focused on urban areas than on their surrounding rural
landscapes. Here, awareness-raising and incentives are needed,
particularly those encouraging females into the use of areas beyond the
urban land. Our results suggest a lack of meaningful integration between
the core city and the periphery, with lessons for urban planners.

N2  - Survey-based welfare measures for public goods are often very sensitive
to value elicitation methods, for example, whether the elicitation is
framed as an up-or-down vote or an open-ended willingness-to-pay (WTP)
question. Leading hypotheses for elicitation effects are tied to either
behavioral factors (e.g., psychological cues) or differences in
perceived economic incentives. Past research that emphasizes behavioral
drivers does not precisely control economic incentives, potentially
confounding inferences. We conduct an experiment that controls economic
incentives through incentive-compatible elicitation methods and compare
single binary choice, double-bounded binary choice, payment card, and
open-ended response formats. Our experiment retains important field
survey characteristics, including the valuation of an environmental
public good with passive-use value. All formats elicit statistically
indistinguishable WTP distributions, suggesting that behavioral factors
may not be the primary drivers of elicitation effects. To the extent
that our laboratory methods can be mirrored in the field, this offers a
pathway for mitigating elicitation effects.

This paper aims to investigate the motivating and dissuading factors,
which develop consumers' attitude towards permission based marketing.
Design/methodology/approach
A conceptual model is proposed and validated by following the various
studies on mobile and email marketing. A survey of 325 respondents was
conducted in the Mumbai city, out of which 271 survey questionnaires
were deemed fit for analysis, representing 83.38 per cent response rate.
The researcher has used structural equation modelling to test the causal
relationships among the constructs.
Findings
The results of the study indicate that increase in personal relevant
messages, perceived monetary incentives and perceived entertainment
increases consumers' attitude towards permission based marketing,
whereas increase in perceived registration effort decreases consumers'
attitude towards permission based marketing. Furthermore, contrary to
the existing literature, perceived consumer empowerment, perceived
intrusiveness and perceived privacy issues have no significant
relationship with the attitude towards permission marketing. The
findings are based on a particular region in India, so it may be
different from previous studies.
Originality/value
Fewer research studies have been done to examine the motivating and
dissuading factors developing consumers' attitude towards permission
based marketing, therefore, the present research is conducted. After
intensely reviewing the available literature, the factors were carefully
chosen.

but there is uncertainty about how to respond.
Background We sought New Zealand ophthalmologists' opinions on climate
change, sustainability and the role of ophthalmologists in responding to
these issues, as well as information on the extent that ophthalmology
practices are acting on sustainability.
Design Anonymous online survey of New Zealand fellows and trainees (178)
of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists
(RANZCO) was conducted.
Participants Forty-seven respondents (response rate 26%) were included
in the study.
Methods Respondents were asked their level of agreement with statements
on climate, health and sustainability and invited to comment. Current
sustainability activities were collected from clinical leaders and
directors of hospital departments and private practices.
Main Outcome Measure Distribution of agreement scores was the main
outcome measure.
Results Agreement with mainstream positions on climate change was as
expected. A minority of up to 19% expressed the opinion that climate
change was not due to human activity, and did not require mitigation.
Younger ophthalmologists tended to have greater agreement with the need
for broad-based political action on climate mitigation than those aged
over 50 years. Most practices had room to improve on reducing waste,
travel and carbon footprints.
Conclusions and Relevance The majority of New Zealand ophthalmologists
are concerned about anthropogenic climate change. Currently,
sustainability is not a performance indicator for New Zealand district
health boards, so there is limited incentive to drive improvements.
These data form a reference point to compare future opinions and
ophthalmology carbon footprinting.

N2  - Background: The use of insulin pump and glucose sensor is advantageous,
but unfortunately many experience skin problems. To reduce or overcome
skin problems, patients use additional products or change their sets
preterm. Therefore, the aim was to investigate costs related to skin
problems.
Materials and Methods: Two hundred sixty-three patients from four
different hospitals in Denmark participated in a cross-sectional survey
about skin problems related to insulin pump and/or glucose sensor use.
Additional costs aside technology and diabetes treatment were calculated
based on adhesives, patches, lotion, and preterm shifts of infusion or
sensor sets due to skin problems. Descriptive statistics and linear
regression were used.
Results: The total costs for all these expenses were 11493.9 U.S.
dollars (USD) in 145 pediatric patients and 4843 USD in 118 adult
patients. The costs were higher in patients with, than without, skin
problems and for skin problems due to the glucose sensor compared with
insulin pump. Pediatric patients with eczema and/or wound due to the
glucose sensor did cost 154.3 USD more, than patients without these skin
problems (P < 0.01). We found a clear dose/response relationship between
costs and severity of skin problems, especially in pediatric patients.
Conclusions: Our data show that skin problems due to use of insulin pump
and/or glucose sensor have significant costs on the Danish welfare
system. This leaves an economic incentive for developing more
skin-sensitive adhesive for the infusion set and sensors, at least for a
certain subgroup of patients.

However, failure to return needles can cause friction with local
communities. The purpose of this study was to identify perceived
barriers to needle return. Participants were 192 individuals who were
recruited from needle exchange programs. Participants completed and
returned a brief survey including free-response questions about barriers
to needle return. Results suggested several barriers to needle return,
including both individual and structural issues. Participants largely
advocated for use of incentives and stricter regulations to encourage
higher rates of needle return. These results suggest some initial steps
that programs can take to increase needle return rates, such as working
with participants to reduce problems with needle storage and
maintenance.

N2  - Many rural areas throughout the Great Plains, including Kansas, have
been affected by ``brain drain{''} or the out-migration of well-educated
people. In response to this negative outlook, in 2012, Kansas
implemented the Rural Opportunity Zone (ROZ) Program to encourage
college-educated adults to move to the state's rural counties. This
brief aims to identify what influences individuals to participate in the
program and what types of individuals are likely to participate. This
study employed a survey of Kansas State University students and
interviews with local officials who manage the program. Survey results
reveal that most students do not view themselves as likely to
participate in the program despite its financial incentives. Students
likely to participate come from ROZ counties, are likely to find
employment in rural areas, and hold positive views of rural life.
Interviews with county officials revealed that the program primarily
benefits individuals who had already intended to live in a rural area,
and that the program rarely attracts newcomers. The program is poorly
funded in many counties, and a lack of high-paying jobs limits growth in
a way that the ROZ cannot outweigh. This brief also highlights the need
for changes concerning the program's benefits and awareness.

best practices and 3 types of outcomes. Design: A cross-sectional design
used data from the HERO Scorecard Benchmark Database. Setting: Data were
voluntarily provided by employers who submitted web-based survey
responses. Sample: Analyses were limited to 812 organizations that
completed the HERO Scorecard between January 12, 2015 and October 2,
2017. Measures: Independent variables included organizational and
leadership support, program comprehensiveness, program integration, and
incentives. Dependent variables included participation rates, health and
medical cost impact, and perceptions of organizational support.
Analysis: Three structural equation models were developed to investigate
the relationships among study variables. Results: Model sample size
varied based on organizationally reported outcomes. All models fit the
data well (comparative fit index > 0.96). Organizational and leadership
support was the strongest predictor (P < .05) of participation (n = 276
organizations), impact (n = 160 organizations), and perceived
organizational support (n = 143 organizations). Incentives predicted
participation in health assessment and biometric screening (P < .05).
Program comprehensiveness and program integration were not significant
predictors (P > .05) in any of the models. Conclusion: Organizational
and leadership support practices are essential to produce participation,
health and medical cost impact, and perceptions of organizational
support. While incentives influence participation, they are likely
insufficient to yield downstream outcomes. The overall study design
limits the ability to make causal inferences from the data.

on the availability of flexible appliances and control technologies and
their willingness to conduct automated DR. Taking cross-cutting flexible
appliances in the subsectors offices, trade and hotels/restaurants into
account, our estimations result in approximately 22 TWh of theoretical
potential (similar to 35% of total electricity consumption of the
subsectors), 4 TWh of technical potential and 1 TWh of practical
potential. Relevant barriers to DR are its perceived low priority and
inadequate financial incentives due to a small share of energy costs
within firms, whereas customer image of DR is perceived as an important
driver. Knowledge of barriers and drivers is valuable for designing
policies, which incorporate the needs of applicants and enable companies
to participate in DR. Across European countries, the structure and share
of electricity demand of the service sector is fairly comparable (with
differences arising from climatic context); hence the insights derived
here are in its main conclusions also relevant for the entirety of
Europe.

N2  - Noncognitive skills (e.g., persistence and self-control) are typically
measured using self-reported questionnaires in which respondents rate
their own skills. In many applications-including program evaluation and
school accountability systems-such reports are assumed to measure only
the skill of interest. However, self-reports might also capture other
dimensions aside from the skill, such as aspects of a respondent's
situation, which could include incentives and the conditions in which
they complete the questionnaire. To explore this possibility, this study
conducted 2 experiments to estimate the extent to which survey
administration conditions can affect student responses on noncognitive
skill questionnaires. The first experiment tested whether providing
information about the importance of noncognitive skills to students
directly affects their responses, and the second experiment tested
whether incentives tied to performance on another task indirectly affect
responses. Both experiments suggest that self-reports of noncognitive
skills are sensitive to survey conditions. The effects of the conditions
are relatively large compared with those found in the program evaluation
literature, ranging from 0.05 to 0.11 5Ds. These findings suggest that
the effects of interventions or other social policies on self-reported
noncognitive skills should be interpreted with caution.

N2  - The study investigates the awareness, practices and attitudes of
researchers in regard to open data - i.e. the sharing and reuse of
research data - which is part of a larger study that concentrated on the
scholarly communication readiness of Malaysian researchers in Open
Science. The data were gathered by means of a survey which obtained 135
responses from researchers based in five research universities in
Malaysia. The main conclusions are: (a) the researchers are aware of
open data, yet, they are not practising it as shown in the mean scores,
as well as in their responses towards the statements asked; (b) unclear
information on data privacy policy, misuse of data, and the fear of
losing publication opportunity are part of disincentives for data
sharing. The requisite for open data understanding, practices and
attitudinal change is needed for these may impact research practices,
government policies and scientific knowledge, leading to research
transparency and accountability, social benefit and economic growth.
This paper concludes with a discussion that policies incentivizing the
sharing and reuse of open data, as well as tools and guidance to support
data sharing, and a strong incentives and rewards to implement open data
among researchers, should be encouraged. Future studies should look into
the importance of rewards for data sharing among researchers'
institutions. Studies bridging the gap between policy and practices of
open data should be examined, if true openness in research is to be
established in Malaysia.

N2  - This two-part paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey on how
emerging technologies, e.g., wireless and networking, artificial
intelligence (AI) can enable, encourage, and even enforce social
distancing practice. In Part I, an extensive background of social
distancing is provided, and enabling wireless technologies are
thoroughly surveyed. In this Part II, emerging technologies such as
machine learning, computer vision, thermal, ultrasound, etc., are
introduced. These technologies open many new solutions and directions to
deal with problems in social distancing, e.g., symptom prediction,
detection and monitoring quarantined people, and contact tracing.
Finally, we discuss open issues and challenges (e.g.,
privacy-preserving, scheduling, and incentive mechanisms) in
implementing social distancing in practice. As an example, instead of
reacting with ad-hoc responses to COVID-19-like pandemics in the future,
smart infrastructures (e.g., next-generation wireless systems like 6G,
smart home/building, smart city, intelligent transportation systems)
should incorporate a pandemic mode in their standard
architectures/designs.

N2  - Introduction: This study is a part of an effort to determine the
challenges faced by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) radiographers towards
role extension and advanced practice. It reflects the current practice
and challenges facing role extension compared to international
advancement. The study aimed to assess the radiographers who worked at
mammography screening perception and readiness to accept role extension
and advanced practice in mammography.
Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study using an online survey was
conducted among radiographers who practice mammography. The survey
captured demographics, qualifications, professional education, future
development plans, interest in role extension, and incentive to pursue
the mammography profession.
Results: Forty-five radiographers were invited to participate in the
study the response rate was 71% (n=32), 34.4 (11%) were UAE nationals
with the remainder being expats. The majority were young between 25 and
45 years old (84.4%), 81.3% hold a BSc qualification. 56.3% completed
a post-qualification training specialized mammography certificate. 81%
of the participants showed interest in role extension after appropriate
education, training, and supervision by radiologists.
Conclusion: This study reports on the perceptions and readiness of
radiographers on advanced practice within breast-screening centers. The
results show acceptance and support after proper training, clear career
pathway, and licensing body recognition. The role of the radiographer in
the UAE is still growing.

N2  - In this paper, we examine rates of careless responding and reactions to
detection methods (i.e., attention check items and instructions) in an
experimental setting based on two different samples. First, we use a
quota sample (with monetary incentive), a central data source for
internet-based surveys in sociological and political research. Second,
we include a voluntary opt-in panel (without monetary incentive) well
suited for conducting survey experiments (e.g., factorial surveys).
Respondents' reactions to the detection items are analyzed by objective,
nonreactive indicators (i.e., break-off, item nonresponse, and
measurement quality), and two self-report scales. Our reaction analyses
reveal that the detection methods we applied are not only well suited
for identifying careless respondents, but also exert a motivational
rather than a demotivating influence on respondents' answer behavior
and, hence, contribute to data quality. Furthermore, we find that
break-off behavior differs across both samples suggesting that results
from methodological online studies on the basis of incentivized samples
do not necessarily transfer to online studies in general.

N2  - Background: Providing quality clinical sites and preceptors is one of
the greatest challenges for nurse practitioner programs.
Purpose: To conduct a national survey of nurse practitioner (NP) program
directors to better understand the complex process for clinical site
placement in the United States.
Methods: In 2018, a web-based survey was sent to program directors to
ascertain the faculty and staff effort allocation and processes related
to NP student placements, the number of required clinical rotations, the
total hour requirement, and preceptor incentives and barriers.
Findings: There was a 47% survey response rate. Variation in processes
was found across NP programs. Almost 14% of respondents said that
students were required to find sites entirely on their own. Ten percent
of faculty reported devoting 90% to 100% of their effort to finding
preceptors. Preceptors and sites were rarely paid, but other incentives
were common.
Discussion: It is vital for NP programs to streamline clinical placement
processes, to foster academic-practice partnerships, and to advocate for
federal funding to train the future NP workforce.

N2  - Objective. To determine how changes to the student evaluation of
teaching (SET) survey instrument and process at a college of pharmacy
contributed to improved student response rates and to understand how the
process could be further refined.
Methods. Pharmacy students from the class of 2018 who had participated
in both the old and new SET process were recruited to participate in one
of four focus group interviews. An inductive approach was used for data
collection and analysis. A focus group guide was created based on two
major domains: comparing changes between the old and new SET process and
survey form, and determining how the new SET process could be further
refined.
Results. In South Jordan, UT, six students participated in one of the
focus groups and seven students participated in the other focus group.
In Henderson, NV, seven students participated in each of the two focus
groups. Twenty-seven total students participated in the four focus
groups across two campuses. Students stated that reducing the number of
questions on each SET survey instrument and using a 5-point rather than
a 10-point Likert scale were positive changes. The changes also
motivated them to complete the surveys, which improved overall response
rates. Although students reported that the monetary incentive
(contributions toward the cost of the class banquet) that had been added
to the new SET process was a strong motivator, the incentive itself
would have likely been insufficient without the other changes. Several
participants stated that receiving feedback from faculty members on
changes made to teaching materials based upon previous student
evaluations was also an important motivator for students to continue
completing the surveys.
Conclusion. Students identified several motivators for SET
participation. Improving the process for survey completion is essential
to improve response rates to more accurately represent the feedback of
the entire student body. Additionally, the evaluation process must
ensure that the data gathered are robust, accurate, and insightful, to
be of good use of student and faculty time.

N2  - Background: Social isolation, loneliness and anxiety-depressive states
are emerging health conditions in the elderly. Research question: To
assess whether a 4-month programme of physical activity in a group
improves the emotional, social and quality of life situation in a sample
of subjects over 64 years old people. Methods: Multi-centre randomized
clinical trial of two groups. Study population: Patients older than 64
years assigned to three primary care teams from different locations.
Inclusion criteria: Submit a score <32 on the DUKE-UNC-11 social support
scale, or >12 on the Beck Depression Scale, or >10 on the Generalized
Anxiety Scale (GAD-7), at the start of the study. The intervention group
participated in a group physical activity program for 4-months that
consisted of progressively walking sessions two days a week, 60-150
minutes long depending on the physical condition of each participant.
Results: Enrolled were 94 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Mean
age was 74 years (SD 5.18) and 76.6% were women. No significant
differences were found at the beginning of the study between the two
groups in relation to the outcome of the scales evaluated. Once the
intervention was completed, improvement in the quality of life and
social support was detected in the intervention group (p<.05). Both
groups improved the depression and anxiety clinic but the improvement in
the participants of the intervention group was higher. Those with
initial depression improved 8.6 points on the scale, compared to the
control that improved 3.3 points, with the final average of 17.4. Those
who presented initial anxiety improved 8 points (final average: 7.5
points, cut-off point for the diagnosis of anxiety 10), compared to the
control that improved 5.1 points. Conclusion: The results of this study
indicate that the program developed has positive effects on improving
the quality of life, social support and depression and anxiety clinic.
Background: Tourism represents 45% gross domestic product in Balearic
Islands. Working as a hotel housekeeper (HH) has been associated with
important morbidity, especially musculoskeletal, chronic pain, a
significant number of sick leaves, a high consumption of medication,
poor psychological well-being and worse quality of life. Research
question: Explore perceptions and opinions regarding the HH's work and
health problems. Estimate and evaluate HH's health determinants, the
exposition to several occupational risk factors, their lifestyles and
health problems and their quality of life. Methods: Design: mixed
methods: (1) exploratory qualitative study (QS) including 10
semi-structured interviews and six focus groups; (2). descriptive study
(DS): individual interviews and clinical medical records. Inclusion
criteria: older than 18 years, had worked during the last summer season
in the Balearic Islands. Analysis: QS: transcription and content
analysis; DS: descriptive statistical analysis. Results: QS: Identified
positive aspects of their work: timetables, relationship with
co-workers, attending clients. Highlighted negative aspects: working
conditions, hard physical workload, stressful duties and insufficiently
rewarded. HH associated their health problems with their work; coping
strategies: self-medication or visiting their general practitioner. DS:
1.043 HH included. Mean age 43.3 years, mean working years as HH 10.7
years. Mean rooms/day: 18.1 (+/- 6.5); mean beds/day: 44.6 (+/- 20.7).
HH reported often pain during the last summer season: 68.2% (IC 95%
65.3-71.0) low back pain; 60.9% (IC 95% 57.8-63.8) wrist and hands;
55.3% (IC 95% 52.2-58.3) cervical. 41.6% and 35.1% self-reported
regular and poor health status, respectively. Conclusion: HH perceived
hard and stressful working conditions, partly justified by the number of
rooms and beds made per day. They also perceived health problems related
to their work. HH frequently reported pain during the last summer
season. Moreover, they perceive regular or poor health status, weaker
than women from the same social class do.
Background: Gender-based violence (GBV) is a public health and human
rights issue, being highly prevalent (12-51%), repetitive and having a
severe impact on women's health, with a high sanitary and social cost.
Primary care has a key role in detection and management. There is low
detection and delay in diagnosis. There is a lack of preparation to
recognize abuse, especially in the approach and action after detection.
Greater awareness and sensitization is required. Research question: Can
a brief specific training intervention in GBV imparted to primary health
care professionals in their primary health centre increase knowledge,
improve attitudes and skills? Methods: A cluster-randomized clinical
trial was carried out in Vigo area primary health centres with at least
20 health care professionals. A basal evaluation was made through a
validated inquiry (PREMIS), which they had to retake after three months.
In the intervention centres, a clinical session was imparted. pResults:
Out of 264 primary health care professionals, 145 participated. There
was a 63.5% loss out of 145 professionals. A statistically significant
difference was detected in the field of knowledge, increasing an average
of two points on a scale from 0 to 5 in these aspects: how to make
appropriate questions; connections between GBV and pregnancy; why do not
they leave their partners; risk determination and phases of GBV. There
was also a decrease in the idea that if the patient does not recognize
gender violence, there is very little that can be done. No significant
differences were detected in the detection and follow-up. Conclusion:
Significant differences were found in the knowledge and attitude
sections after performing the intervention to the professionals. The
results support the implementation of continuous brief training on GBV
in primary care.
Background: Out-of-hours (OOH) primary care is a topic of great interest
in European countries. Reasons for this are similar across borders: to
guarantee continuity of care with decreasing numbers of health care
workers and to guard equity in OOHcare for all patients. In OOHcare
research, valid and accessible research data are needed to fill the
knowledge gap. iCAREdata aims to offer valid and immediately available
information from OOHcare. Research question: How feasible is it to
collect, store and link data of different OOH services in Belgium and to
improve data quality registration? How useful are aggregated data to
inform stakeholders, to evaluate (the quality of) services in OOH care
and the effects of interventions? Methods: As a first achievement, data
flows, encryption and encoding were carefully designed and implemented.
Solid cooperation with the federal eHealth web services as a trusted
third party was crucial. Ethical approval and approval by the data
protection authority was obtained. Clear agreements were established
concerning access control. A strict code of conduct was agreed upon. A
steering committee was established to guard the procedures. Results:
First data were collected in 2015. iCAREdata now receives +/- 3000
unique patient contacts per weekend, spread over 14 general practice
cooperatives, and covering about a quarter of the Flemish population.
Aggregated data, directly processed, are provided weekly on . This
portal site offers an overview of, among others, the latest diagnostics,
drug prescriptions and workload. iCAREdata project also collects data
from emergency departments in hospitals and community pharmacists and
link them to evaluate further OOH primary care. Conclusion: Developing a
research database on OOHcare is feasible. The iCAREdata project succeeds
in an automated output every week, offering insights on the evolution of
morbidity, services and effects of interventions. Careful validation and
interpretation of the data is a crucial ongoing challenge.
Background: More than half of decompensations of heart failure are
attended in primary care setting. No score that helps to ascertain the
short-term prognosis in these patients. Research question: To develop
and validate a short-term score (30 days) to predict hospitalizations or
death in patients attended in primary care as a consequence of
decompensation of heart failure, based on variables easily measurable in
primary care setting Methods: Prospective multinational cohort study
including patients treated because of a heart failure decompensation in
primary care setting. There were a derivation (Spain) and a validation
cohort (nine European countries). Results: The derivation cohort
included 561 patients, women were 56%, mean age was 82.2 (SD 8.03)
years and 31.5% of patients were hospitalized or died in the first
month. In the validation cohort, 238 patients were included, women were
54%, mean age was 79.0 (10.4) years and 26.9% of patients were
hospitalized or died in the first month. According to the multivariate
models, sex, age, hospital admission due to heart failure the previous
year, and a heart rate greater than 100 beats/minute, orthopnoea,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, NYHA functional stage III or IV,
saturation of oxygen lower than 90% or an increase in the dyspnoea at
the consultation with the General practitioner were included in the
HEFESTOS-SCORE. The multivariate model including these variables showed
a good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow p=.35) and discrimination (AUC 0.81,
95% CI 0.77-0.85). In the validation cohort, the model presented an
adequate external validation with good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow
p=.35) and discrimination (AUC 0.74, 95% CI 0.67-0.82). Conclusion: The
HEFESTOS-SCORE, based on clinical and demographical variables easily
measurable in primary care is a useful tool to stratify the short-term
hospitalization and mortality in patients attended because of a heart
failure decompensation.
Background: Despite recommendations against long-term benzodiazepine
(BZD) use, they are often prescribed during months or years in primary
care. Research question: To determine facilitators and barriers that
explain the variation in implementation of a primary care educational
and feedback intervention targeted to general practitioners (GPs) to
reduce BZDs prescriptions. Methods: A hybrid type I clinical trial:
qualitative data to evaluate the implementation outcomes. Three health
districts of Spain: Balearic Islands, Tarragona-Reus district
(Catalonia) and Arnau de Vilanova lliria district (Valencia). Forty
stakeholders (GPs) participated in five focus groups; they were selected
based on their effectiveness of the intervention results: high (three
groups) or low (two groups) and individual interviews to two GP of low
efficiency. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research
(CFIR) was used to guide collection and analysis of qualitative data.
Two researchers evaluated the qualitative data of the focus groups by
the Codebook and Rating Rules of CFIR, independently. Results: Of the 31
CFIR constructs assessed, three constructs strongly distinguished
between GPs with low versus high success of the intervention
(intervention complexity, individual state of change, key stakeholders
engaging), seven additional constructs weakly distinguished
(adaptability, external policy and incentives, implementation climate,
compatibility, relative priority, self-efficacy, formally appointed
internal implementation leaders), 10 had insufficient data to assess and
11 were non-related to the success of the intervention. Conclusion: We
identified the constructs that explain the variation in the
effectiveness of the intervention; this information is relevant to
redesign successful implementation strategies focused on these
constructs to implement the BENZORED intervention in health services.
Background: Despite recommendations against long-term benzodiazepine
(BZD) use, they are often prescribed during months or years in primary
care. Research question: To evaluate the effectiveness of a primary care
educational and feedback intervention targeted to general practitioners
(GPs) to reduce BZDs prescriptions. Methods: Design: A two-arm parallel
cluster randomized clinical trial. Settings: Primary Healthcare centres
from three health districts of Spain: Balearic Islands (IbSalut),
Catalonia (Institut Catala de la Salut; Tarragona-Reus district) and
Community of Valencia (Conselleria de Salut Universal; Arnau de Vilanova
lliria district). Participants: All GPs from the health districts
included were invited to participate. Ninety percent of the GPs accepted
to participate. Intervention: GPs received an educational two hours
workshop training about the rationale for prescribing BZDs and
deprescribing strategies for long-term BZD users, audit and monthly
feedback about their prescription and access to a support web page with
information to help them and leaflets to give to the patients. Control
group: GPs did not receive any component of the intervention. Outcomes:
Defined daily dose (DDD)/1000 inhabitants/year (DHD) of BZDs prescribed
by GP at 12 months. Proportion of long-term BZD users (>6 months) and in
patients aged 65 or more at 12 months. Statistical analysis: Generalized
mixed linear random effect models to account for clustering at the level
of healthcare centre and all analyses were based on an intention to
treat principle. Results: We included 749 GPs and 49 (6.5%) were lost
to follow-up. Adjusted difference between groups in DHD at 12 months was
-3.26 (-4.87;-1.65), p<.001. The differences in the proportion of
long-term BZD users was -0.39 (-0.58;-0.19), p<.001 and in patients
older than 65 was -0.87 (-1.35;-0.26), p=.004. Conclusion: An
educational and feedback intervention targeted to GPs is effective to
reduce BZD prescription in primary care.
Background: Patients who might also go to the general practitioner (GP)
frequently consult emergency departments (ED). This leads to decreased
efficiency, high workload at the ED and additional costs for both
government and patient. Research question: The primary outcome is the
proportion of patients who enter the ED and are handled by the GP after
triage. Secondary outcomes: Referral rate to the ED by the GP,
proportion of patients not following the triage advice, compliance of
the nurse to the triage-instructions and health insurance expenditures.
Furthermore, facilitators and barriers will be studied and an incident
analysis will be performed. Methods: This is a randomised controlled
trial with weekends serving as clusters. Patients presenting at the ED
during OOH are triaged and allocated to either ED or GP by a trained
nurse using an extension to the Manchester Triage System (MTS). During
control clusters, all patients remain at the ED. Data are collected
using a database for OOH care (iCAREdata). Results: So far, 296 out of
2733 (11%) patients were allocated to the GP. Two-thirds (194) of these
patients did go to the GP leading to a primary outcome of 7% for 14
intervention weekends. Only eight patients were referred back to the ED.
Compliance of the nurse to the extended MTS was 93%, in 6% of the
cases the nurse chose ED instead of GPC and in less than one percent GPC
instead of ED. The nurses chose higher urgency categories and more
discriminators, leading to the GP during intervention clusters. Using an
automated system, these results are updated weekly, on our poster, we
will show more results that are complete. Conclusion: These first
results reveal a low efficiency but a high safety of the intervention.
More prolonged data collection combined with a process analysis and cost
efficiency study is necessary before definitive conclusions can be
drawn.
Background: Low back pain is a multifactorial condition with individual
and societal impact. Psychosocial factors play a larger prognostic roll.
Therefore, earlier multidisciplinary treatment strategy (physical,
psychological and social/occupational) could be applied to search
improvement in fear-avoidance beliefs with positive effect in the
evolution of low back pain. Research question: Evaluate the
effectiveness of a biopsychosocial multidisciplinary intervention
(physiotherapy, cognitive-behavioural and pharmacological therapy)
through the changes in fear-avoidance beliefs (FABs), in working
population with sub-acute non-specific LBP, compared to usual clinical
care at 3 and 12 months. Methods: A cluster randomised clinical trial,
conducted in 39 Primary Health Care Centres (PHCC) in Barcelona.
Participants between 18 and 65 years old (n = 369; control group =188,
PHCC 26 and intervention group =181, PHCC 13). Control group received
usual care, according to guidelines. Intervention group received usual
care plus a biopsychosocial multidisciplinary intervention (sessions 10
hours/total). The main outcome was the Fear-Avoidance Beliefs
questionnaire (FABQ). Other outcomes: Evolution to chronicity.
Assessment at baseline, 3 and 12 months. Analysis was by intention to
treat and analyst blinded. Multiple imputations. Results: Of the 369
enrolled patients with LBP, 421 (84.0%) provided data at the three
months of follow-up, and 387 (77.2%) at 12 months. Mean age of study
subjects at baseline was 45.1 (SD: 10.4) years-old and 61.2% were
women. At baseline, there were no differences. Both groups showed a
decrease in FABQ (FAB physical and FAB-work) at three months and twelve
months, with a significant difference at long-term. At FAB-physical
performance, there was no significant difference over the follow-up time
and at FAB-Work, a substantial difference at 12 months between groups.
Conclusion: A multidisciplinary biopsychosocial intervention showed a
positive effect in FABs by improving fear behaviours and avoidance at
work.
Community participation in primary healthcare is enshrined in
international policies since the 1970s and has been re-emphasised since
then, most recently in the 2018 WHO Astana Declaration (). The concept
comes from a social justice perspective. It emphasises that the
participation of communities who experience poverty and social exclusion
is essential to the development of primary health care services shaping
these services and making them relevant to those with the greatest need.
This is important if we are to address the well-documented Inverse Care
Law. There is, however, a translational gap between policy and practice.
The stability of policies for community participation in primary
healthcare is patchy. The implementation of policies into conventional
ways of working is patchy. Where implementation has occurred, the
coverage of community participation initiatives can be patchy - not all
community members are involved. The literature shows a pattern of
exclusion whereby so-called `hard to reach' groups are not adequately
involved in primary healthcare decision-making. This is the case for
refugees and migrants who arrive to settle and integrate into host
countries in Europe. The recent WHO Strategy and Action Plan for Refugee
and Migrant Health (2016; ) is a call for action to disrupt this pattern
of exclusion and improve the health of refugees and migrants. Drawing on
the rich tradition of participatory health research is a valuable way
forward because it provides important concepts, tools and techniques for
research that is more inclusive and primary care practice. This
presentation will describe innovative examples of success in family
practice settings from around Europe. These have brought together
refugees and migrants with primary care stakeholders and enabled them to
work together to introduce and sustain changes in clinical practice.
This evidence can be used to guide and strengthen community
participation in primary healthcare, for all.
Background: Community participation is essential for effective
implementation of research programmes in primary healthcare (PHC) but
also appropriate interpretation of results and optimal delivery of
subsequent care. Stakeholder engagement undertaken under defined and
evaluated frameworks may be key for the establishment of concrete
collaboration and communication between communities and other parties
involved in research. This abstract aims to report on community and
stakeholder engagement methodologies, plans and activities of European
research projects conducted in Crete, Greece. Research question: Could a
consensus be reached regarding the methods and tools for enhancing
stakeholder engagement in community-oriented PHC research? Methods:
Examined programmes included RESTORE (FP7), FRESH AIR (Horizon2020) and
VIGOUR (Health Programme). Identified methodologies included
Normalisation Process Theory, Participatory Learning and Action, Five
Steps of Stakeholders' Engagement, establishment of Stakeholder
Engagement Groups under the 9 C's model (commissioners, customers,
collaborators, contributors, channels, commentators, consumers,
champions, competitors) and Structured Democratic Dialogue. These were
implemented to a range of stakeholders, including community members,
patients, migrants, Roma populations, healthcare professionals and
policy-makers. Qualitative research (focus groups, individual
interviews) and Thematic Content Analysis were used for design and
analysis of engagement activities. Results: In RESTORE, migrants and
other stakeholders selected guidelines and training supporting
cross-cultural communication in PHC consultations, based on their own
needs and expectations. Community members, healthcare professionals and
healthcare authorities were actively involved in FRESH AIR by
identifying local priorities and contextual factors for designing
project interventions, providing access to communities and supporting
dissemination of project achievements. In VIGOUR, multidisciplinary
stakeholders were brought together and formulated a joint ambition
statement for the future of integrated care in Crete. Conclusion:
Various stakeholder engagement methods with documented effects are
currently available. Their systematic identification, appraisal,
synthesis and consolidation may serve with enhancing community
participation in PHC, sustaining research results and translating
findings into appropriate actions.
Background: Screening for prostate cancer remains controversial,
implying a trade-off between benefits and harms, and a shared
decision-making process has been advocated. Decision aids are
evidence-based tools that improve decision quality. For limited-resource
countries, translating and making cultural adaptations to high-quality
decision aids is a reasonable alternative to developing new ones.
Research question: We aimed to translate and culturally adapt an English
language patient decision aid addressing prostate cancer screening, so
that Portuguese men can use it. Methods: We followed the European Centre
for Disease Prevention and Control's (ECDC) five-step, stakeholder-based
approach to adapting health communication materials: (1) selection of
materials and process coordinators; (2) early review; (3) translation
and back translation; (4) comprehension testing with cognitive
semi-structured interviews; (5) proofreading. Cognitive interviews were
conducted with 15 men, ages 55-69, from the Oporto district local
community to refine the decision aid after its translation. Content
analysis was performed using Ligre (TM) software. Results: Five main
themes are presented: informational content, information comprehension,
socio-cultural appropriateness, feelings and primary message, and
personal perspective concerning prostate cancer screening. For each
theme, illustrative quotes extracted from men's interviews are
presented. Most men found the translated version of the decision aid to
be clear, comprehensive and appropriate for its target population,
albeit some suggested that medical terms could be a barrier. The data
collected from men's interviews allowed the researchers to clarify
concepts and expand existing content. Conclusion: The final version of
the decision aid can be used in the real world clinical setting and our
ECDC based approach can be replicated by other workgroups to translate
and culturally adapt decision aids.
What are we talking about when we talk about value? In 2006, Michael
Porter and Elizabeth O. Teisberg published; Redefining Health Care,
Creating Value-Based Competition on Results, Harvard Business School
Press. Affirming that payers and providers, including doctors and
nurses, are very concerned in demonstrating that they work a lot, and
very little, or nothing, in assessing what their work contributes to the
health of people and communities. Michael Porter is famous in the
business world for his work on competitiveness based on the value of
products and services. He has introduced this concept in the provision
of health services, all summarised in a phrase: Health systems should
seek to obtain the maximum possible value for the health of people for
every dollar they spend. However, to define the value in healthcare, the
patient must be introduced into the equation, so, in Porterian terms,
the value is the perception that people have about clinical
effectiveness and the costs of therapeutic processes. Clinical
effectiveness is measurable from epidemiology (to be readmitted to a
hospital fewer times or living longer); value, on the other hand, is
reflected by people's experience. We need to ask questions such as do
patients with advanced diseases want to live longer, or they want to
enjoy the highest quality of life possible. Depending on the response,
we can develop different delivery models. What is value-based
healthcare? According to NEJM Catalyst, Value-based healthcare is a
healthcare delivery model in which providers, including hospitals and
physicians, are paid based on patient health outcomes (). Under
value-based care agreements, providers are rewarded for helping patients
improve their health, reduce the effects and incidence of chronic
disease, and live healthier lives in an evidence-based way. How to
achieve a Value-Based Healthcare Model The following six drivers are the
key to make a primary health care system a value-based healthcare model:
1. Prioritising patient-centred care. 2. From clinical pathways to care
delivery value chains. 3. Promoting the right care and reducing medical
overuse. 4. Turning a fragmented model into another integrated model. 5.
Creating the enabling environment for healthcare transformation. 6.
Fostering community health. How to develop a Value-Based Community
Health Michael Marmot states that if the determinants of health are
mostly social, solutions must also be social, so to improve the quality
of community life, political systems require economic, housing,
education, security and infrastructure programs (Am J Public Health.
2014;104:S517-S519). Nevertheless, the healthcare system must know how
to adjust resources according to the social circumstances of each
community and to understand how to provide a health-oriented vision of
all the social programs. On the other hand, community health is an
intervention model that aims to improve the health of a defined
community that should operate from primary care services to adjust their
actions to the social reality of each territory.
Background: Geriatric care needs to be increased with growing elderly
populations. The Borgholm jurisdiction in the Baltic Island of oland
(Kalmar region) has an older than average senior population and had
difficulties recruiting primary care physicians (PCPs) resulting in high
elderly hospital care consumption. Research question: Could a new model
of geriatric care be able to decrease the hospital care needs of
Borgholm as compared to the rest of Kalmar region? Methods: A new model
of care was developed in Borgholm 2016-2017 where the PCP list was
limited to 1000 patients, daily slots for PCP home care visits could be
booked by community nurses or ambulance nurses and PCPs had daily
anticipatory care planning contacts with Kalmar hospital staff. Results:
Between 2014 and 2018, Borgholm home care patients >75 years old
increased by 70% vs. a 2% decrease for the rest of Kalmar region.
Similarly, Kalmar emergency department visits decreased by 19% in
Borgholm vs. 9% increase for the rest of Kalmar. Also, Kalmar hospital
care episodes decreased 7% in Borgholm vs. 13% increase for the rest
of Kalmar; Kalmar hospital outpatient visits decreased 8% in Borgholm
vs. 21% increase for the rest of Kalmar; total care consumption for >75
years old decreased 4% in Borgholm vs. a 10% increase for the rest of
Kalmar region. Conclusion: A new geriatric care model consisting of a
comprehensive collaboration between strengthened primary care and
community care, hospital care and ambulance care was associated with a
reduction in total care consumption for senior citizens in a rural
Swedish jurisdiction.
Background: Primary health care, the general practitioner, plays a
critical role for early identification and care of patients with
dementia. Early diagnosis of dementia allows starting therapy and
improving the quality of life of the patients. Research question: To
estimate the prevalence and care of patients with dementia in North
Macedonia. Methods: Forty-six general practitioners (GPs) surgeries from
20 cities in Macedonia took part in the project. All individuals age
over 65 years with a diagnosis of dementia were identified from GP
electronic disease registers. Results: Based on the diagnosis, 450
(3.5%) patients were identified from a total population of 12,926 over
65s. The most common dementia was Alzheimer's dementia 294 (65.3%)
followed by vascular dementia 27.11%. The average age of respondents in
the study was 77.5 +/- 8.2 years, with 50% patients under the age of 79
years, 65.6% were female and 68.4% were with elementary school. In the
entire sample, most of the patients diagnosed with dementia 195 (43.3%)
said they lived with another family member. The most common risk factor
was hypertension (85.1%), followed by stroke/ transitory ischemic
attacks (29.3%) and equal percentage, i.e. 26.4% of patients had high
levels of cholesterol and diabetes. To 242 (53.8%) acetylcholinesterase
inhibitors were prescribed (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine), 77
(17.1%) memantine, while 247 (54.9%) another OTC therapy. 227 (50.4%)
reported that they did not receive treatment. An additional analysis of
the reasons for not receiving treatment was made on this sample of
patients who did not receive treatment. It was found that in the
majority of these patients (more than 50%) the reason for not receiving
therapy was that it was not prescribed, in 142 (62.6%). Conclusion:
This is the first national representative study of dementia prevalence
in North Macedonia. Those data can provide information for healthcare
needs people with dementia.
Background: Emotional experience for medical students during clinical
internships is often ignored. Yet, its influence on professional skills
is certain. Research question: `What is the emotional experience of
second and third-year medical students during their first clinical
internship? How do they perceive the management of their experience by
their supervisors?' Methods: A qualitative study was conducted with 12
students in their second or third year of medical training at the
University of Lille, in France, between 2016 and 2019. Interviews were
carried out comprehensively for a total of 17 hours. Following a
grounded theory approach, the analysis terminated when data were
sufficient to offer a conclusive model. Results: Emotional experience
during clinical internship was rich and intense. It was most often
ignored and was not taken into account in the development of
professional skills. The organized management was deficient. Informal
training existed: when a wilful student met a dedicated teacher.
Students would have welcomed a possibility to experience intense
emotions in a protective environment, and only then in an empowering
environment. They expressed the same desire about early exchanges on the
experiences of the internship. A modelling of the informants' emotional
experiences was realized in the form of three diagrams. Conclusion:
Students ask to be challenged to face patients, and then to be listened
to about it. Possible interventions are trauma prevention and detection
of malaise in the workplace; teaching of humanist values; providing
experience and reflexivity through new pedagogical means (such as
cinema, theatre, literature, writing), or relational means (such as
exchange groups, companionship, solidarity commitment, immersive
internships and tutoring); and training supervisors.
Background: Oral anticoagulants (OAC) reduce the risk for stroke and
death from all causes in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation
(NVAF). Research question: To explore adherence rates to OAC among
patients with NVAF and to compare head-to-head adherence rate of
different medications in long-term chronic use. Methods: We conducted a
population-based cohort study Clalit Health Services, Israel. All
patients, 30 years and over, with a diagnosis of NVAF before 2016 and
were treated with OAC were included. We included patients that filled at
least one prescription per year in the three consecutive years
2016-2018. We analysed all prescriptions that were filled for the
medications from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017. We considered
purchasing of at least nine monthly prescriptions during 2017 as `good
medication adherence.' Results: Twenty-six thousand and twenty-nine
patients with NVAF who were treated with OAC were identified. Ten
thousand and two hundred and eighty-four (39.5%) were treated with
apixaban, 6321 (24.3%) were treated with warfarin, 6290 (24.1%) were
treated with rivaroxaban 3134 (12.0%) were treated with dabigatran.
Rates of good medication adherence were 88.9% for rivaroxaban, 84.9%
for apixaban, 83.6% for dabigatran and 55.8% for warfarin (p<.0001).
Good adherence with OAC was associated with lower LDL cholesterol and
glucose levels. Advanced age was associated with higher adherence rates
(p<.001). SES was not associated with medication adherence. Conclusion:
Adherence rates to DOAC among patients with NVAF are high and are higher
than the adherence rate to warfarin. It should be taken into
consideration when choosing OAC treatment for NVAF.
Background: In France, cervical cancer screening by pap-smears should be
conducted triennially. Screening statistics are based on the number of
cytology examinations of smears reimbursed by the Health Insurance
appearing in the claim databases. The percentage of screened women is
lower based on these data than on declarative surveys. If surveys are
overestimating the number of screened women, it is likely that claim
databases underestimate it. Research question: The primary objective was
to determine the underestimation of screened women in claim databases.
The secondary purpose was to estimate the proportion of female patients
not reachable by their GP for a cervical cancer screening in an
organized screening trial. Methods: The population was the 6327 female
patients aged 30-65 years of the 24 GP investigators of the PaCUDAHL-Ge
trial. We compared the lists of their female patients that had no
cytology of Pap test reimbursed during the three prior years, extracted
from the Health Insurance claim databases in 2015 and 2018. We selected
the patients appearing on both lists meaning they had not responded to
the invitation of their GP to be screened in the trial. We searched in
the GPs' records valid reasons not to be screened (hysterectomy, history
of cervical lesion, pregnancy, other conditions making screening
irrelevant) or evidence of screening. Results: The total number of
`unscreened' women in 2018 was 2731, 1737 patients appeared on both
lists, 1522 could be included for analysing, 65 had been screened, 95
had hysterectomy, three had a history of cervical lesion, nine were
pregnant and 10 had other conditions making screening irrelevant, 166
patients were lost to view. Conclusion: Based on GPs' records, health
insurance claim databases underestimate the number of screened women by
7.6%. The percentage of patients not responding to the invitation of
their GP to be screened in the PaCUDAHL-Ge trial is 24.18%.
Background: Over the past decade, the amount of digital data created by
humans with or without connected tools has grown exponentially. The
field of primary care (PC) did not escape this digitization, nor the use
of Big Data algorithms. To evaluate the results of Big Data research in
PC it seemed useful to identify which algorithms are used. Research
question: What are the algorithms used for Big Data research in PC
research and how are they described? Methods: Systematic review of the
literature according to the recommendations of the PRISMA guide. A
search equation using the following MeSH terms `big data, data mining,
Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning, Deep Learning,
Neural Networks Natural Language Processing, general practice,
electronic health records, health records' has been applied to the
PUBMED database. After a selection of the titles and article summaries
according to the inclusion criteria, the full versions of the eligible
articles were read and analysed. Referenced articles of the sources
articles were added to the analysis. The algorithms described in the
articles were extracted and analysed. Results: In total, 778 articles
were identified, 169 were eligible for full reading and 26 articles were
finally selected. The algorithms listed in the articles are poorly
described. The description is usually limited to a general explanation
about how the algorithm works. Seven articles gave a partial description
of the algorithm; a logic diagram was given in four articles and the
codes in only two. Actually, only one article fully describes the
algorithm with its mathematical description, its code and its logic
diagram. Conclusion: Big Data algorithms in PC are not satisfactorily
described. The lack of reproducibility is not compatible with a
consistent scientific approach. Researchers should provide more
information about the way they extract and analyse their data to give
their readers more confidence in Big Data.
Background: As a collaborative project of the Family Practice Depression
and Multimorbidity group of European General Practice Research Network,
the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25) scale was identified as
valid, reproducible, effective and easy to use. Subsequently, it has
been translated and adapted to 13 languages, including Castilian.
Currently, the scale is being validated in different languages. Research
question: What are the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of
HSCL-25 (HSCL-25e) for depression detection in Primary Care? Methods:
HSCL-25e was administered to outpatients recruited by their physicians
in six health centres involved in Spanish EIRA3 study, a trial to
promote healthy behaviours in people aged from 45 to 75. Patients
complimented HSCL-25 themselves. Sample size was calculated with R
package (pROC). Statistical analysis: responsiveness was analysed with
missing data and detecting ceiling and floor effects for the items.
Principal component analysis (PCA) was done to determine the dimensions
of HSCL-25e. Item-total correlation, Cronbach's alpha (global and
dimensions coefficient) and squared multiple correlation were carried
out to calculate internal consistency. Results: Seven hundred and
sixty-nine patients out of 806 complimented HSCL-25e, 738 answered to
all of the items. No patterns of missing answers were found. No ceiling
effects, expected floor effect in item 18. Item 17 was the most
consistent one and item 24 was the lower one. All items showed positive
discrimination index for both cut-off points (1.55 and 1.75). PCA
indicated two factors; 13 items corresponding to depression dimension
and the other 12 items corresponding to anxiety subscale. Global
Cronbach's alpha was 0.92 (0.88 calculated for depression dimension and
0.84 for anxiety dimension). Conclusion: The HSCL-25e has excellent
psychometric properties when applied to Primary Care population. It has
two dimensions as the original version, although the items included are
not exactly the same. There are more item coincidences with the French
version.
Background: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the first mortality cause
worldwide with 17.5 million death in 2012. Spices (Scaling-up Packages
of Interventions for CVD prevention in selected sites in Europe and
Sub-Saharan Africa) gathered five countries around CVD primary
prevention interventions, especially for populations with low access to
prevention and health care system. In France, a rural area where people
were more deprived and with a low settlement of general practitioners
(GPs) fitted with the project. Research question: What are the barriers
and the facilitators for cardiovascular primary prevention
implementation from caregivers and patients' point of view of a deprived
rural area? Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted until
theoretical saturation of data. Purposive samplings of GPs, patients,
patients' families, nurses and pharmacists were designed. Five interview
guides explored cardiovascular prevention, cardiovascular health
promotion in the setting, actors of CVD prevention, capacities for CVD
prevention, patients' and healthcare professionals' representations,
barriers and facilitators in implementing CVD prevention, possible
solutions. Guides were adapted concurrently to the analysis. A blinded
thematic analysis and a mind-mapping were achieved for each group.
Results: Thirteen GPS, 11 pharmacists', 14 nurses, 12 patients' and 12
patients' family members' interviews were achieved. Professionals
highlighted a disconnection between them and national prevention
programs, lack of time, payment and training for CVD prevention.
Countryside was either protective or aggressive regarding CVD risk
balancing gardening and space against isolation and lack of structures.
GPs had poor connections with the community. Patients described their
recklessness and feeling of invulnerability until their CVD appeared.
Families could be a barrier to CVD prevention and lifestyle change.
Risky behaviours were handed down from one generation to another.
Conclusion: Innovative interventions for Spices should focus on these
community specificities and individual behavioural strategies in
contrast with the six national plans addressing CVD in France. These
plans solely concentrate on dissemination of prevention messages and
knowledge, which is of little use according to this survey.

N2  - Compulsive smartphone use has attracted extensive social attention
because of serious and even fatal outcomes associated with it. However,
there has been little theory-driven research systematically
investigating the mechanism of compulsive behavior in smartphone use.
Although a significant line of literature exists in the area of
personal-computer based technology addiction, the mechanism underpinning
compulsive smartphone use differs significantly because the unique and
specific characteristics of smartphones have given rise to a
fundamentally different usage context with new usage behavioral
patterns. In order to comprehensively theorize this issue, we first
defined compulsive behavior in smartphone use, focusing on mobile social
networking services (SNSs) in particular, and then extended the
stimulus-response-reinforcement framework to investigate the theoretical
network of compulsive use of mobile SNSs. We used online survey data
from 368 active mobile SNS users in China to empirically test and
validate the proposed model and hypotheses. Our results indicate that
both positive and negative reinforcements, as well as the compensatory
component, invoke the feeling of urge that leads to compulsive mobile
SNS use. The positive effects of interactivity as an incentive stimulus
on those reinforcements and compulsive mobile SNS use were also found to
be significant.

N2  - Whereas adaptations to climate change in the agriculture sector are well
studied, non-climatic drivers thereof are considerably less explored.
This is particularly true for market related factors. Every change in
farming practices is attributed to climate change. This article presents
new evidence of how adaptations to market risks may be incorrectly
attributed to climate change risk because of causal attribution bias
emerging from poorly structured survey instrument and response inducing
questions. Through a quasi-experiment administered on 400 rural fanning
households from four districts of Pakistan, we demonstrate that when
farmers are not sensitized about climate change prior to questions on
adaptations they assign market factors such as availability of new
market opportunities, improved purchasing power, and net profitability
as major reason for changes in sowing date, growing new crop verity and
use of fertilizers. To be exact, less than 2% and 1% of farmers
indicated climate change as the reason behind the change in crop variety
and use of fertilizers respectively. Similarly, only 10% of farmers
associated late sowing with climate change. Findings of the study imply
a stronger role of the market-related factors in changing agricultural
practices over the time asking policymakers to design better
market-based interventions and incentives for increasing the adaptation
in the agriculture community. Findings have also implications for mix
method research and can be generalized for all research fields involving
survey design.

N2  - Demand response (DR) has been widely recognized as an important approach
to balance the power grid and reduce peak load of power systems. In
order to better estimate the capability and the expense of peak load
reduction through DR, we need to obtain the residential load profile and
customers' attitudes toward DR programs. Based on a large-scale online
survey collected among over 1500 customers from New York and Texas in
the U.S., this paper investigates the relationships among household
appliance activities (e.g., electric water heater and air conditioner),
load profiles, and incentive-based DR (IBDR) participation for peak load
curtailment through reward payment. The daily load profiles of major
home appliances are developed. Additionally, this paper estimates the
expense of reducing the yearly peak of the local grid load. Finally,
this paper addresses the importance of investigating the multifaceted
factors of affecting IBDR participation and provides useful suggestions
to utility companies when implementing DR programs.

N2  - Background Although there is a great deal of literature regarding
effective recruitment and challenges of recruiting specific patient
populations, there is less known about best practices for recruitment of
nurses as study subjects. Objectives The purpose of this article is to
report our experience with recruitment and retention for a randomized
trial of an online educational program to prepare oncology nurses to
discuss oncology clinical trials with patients. Methods The study
population included currently employed oncology nurses with direct
patient interaction. There were three phases of this study: (1)
qualitative interviews, (2) a pilot test, and (3) the randomized trial.
Phase 3 was rolled out in five waves of recruitment. The distinct phases
of the study-and the gradual roll out of recruitment during Phase
3-allowed us to test and refine our recruitment and retention methods
for the randomized trial. Upon analysis of our response rate and
attrition after the first wave of recruitment in Phase 3, we made
several changes to improve recruitment and retention, including adding
incentives, shortening the survey, and increasing the number of
reminders to complete the program. Results The response rate was higher
when we used both e-mail and U.S. postal mail solicitations. After the
first wave of recruitment in the final phase, changes in our strategies
did not increase our overall response rate significantly; however, the
rate of attrition following baseline declined. Discussion Recruitment
planning is an important component of successful clinical research. The
use of the Internet for both recruitment of subjects and testing of
interventions remains a cost-effective and potentially high yield
methodology. Our research demonstrated several successful approaches to
yield increased participation and retention of subjects, including
seeking formal relationships with professional organizations as sponsors
or supporters, providing meaningful incentives to participants, keeping
surveys or questionnaires as short as possible, and planning multiple
follow-up contacts from the outset.

N2  - Owing to countless advancements in information technology, all
residential consumers, in any part of the world, are empowered to
contribute to demand response (DR) programs, to manage their electricity
usage and to cut associated expenses using a suitable energy management
system. Solutions based on consumer participation in meeting the growing
electricity demand are carried out through different programs, and
incentive-based demand response (IBDR) programs play an important role
in these circumstances. However, introducing such programs to any new
market needs consumers' willingness along with a good policy support.
This study assesses the willingness and interest of consumers to
participate in different IBDR programs and the associated need for
developing policies, based on the consumers' feedback, in a subsidized
electricity market such as that of Kuwait. A survey was conducted to get
feedback from consumers on three different IBDR programs and four
incentive schemes.
After establishing the association between incentivization and load
reduction, and identifying consumers' choice on the most preferred IBDR
programs and incentive schemes, the results were used to assess the need
for different policy strategies for a typical subsidized market. The
results of this study can be taken as a reference for formulating
policies and programs for similar markets. The analysis on the impact of
the programs indicates that by implementing IBDR programs, in addition
to the financial benefit to both consumers and implementer, Kuwait can
maintain its reserve capacity without any further addition of power
plants.

programmes in real time-and in particular to identify and manage their
emergent uncertainties and interdependencies. In this paper, we offer a
worked example of how NASSS can also inform ex post (i.e. retrospective)
evaluation.
Methods: We studied the TORPEDO (Treatment of Cardiovascular Risk in
Primary Care using Electronic Decision Support) research programme, a
multi-faceted computerised quality improvement intervention for
cardiovascular disease prevention in Australian general practice. The
technology (HealthTracker) had shown promise in a cluster randomised
controlled trial (RCT), but its uptake and sustainability in a
real-world implementation phase was patchy. To explain this variation,
we used NASSS to undertake secondary analysis of the multi-modal TORPEDO
dataset (results and process evaluation of the RCT, survey responses,
in-depth professional interviews, videotaped consultations) as well as a
sample of new, in-depth narrative interviews with TORPEDO researchers.
Results: Ex post analysis revealed multiple areas of complexity whose
influence and interdependencies helped explain the wide variation in
uptake and sustained use of the HealthTracker technology: the nature of
cardiovascular risk in different populations, the material properties
and functionality of the technology, how value (financial and
non-financial) was distributed across stakeholders in the system,
clinicians' experiences and concerns, organisational preconditions and
challenges, extra-organisational influences (e.g. policy incentives),
and how interactions between all these influences unfolded over time.
Conclusion: The NASSS framework can be applied retrospectively to
generate a rich, contextualised narrative of technology-supported change
efforts and the numerous interacting influences that help explain its
successes, failures, and unexpected events. A NASSS-informed ex post
analysis can supplement earlier, contemporaneous evaluations to uncover
factors that were not apparent or predictable at the time but dynamic
and emergent.

employer offered wellness incentive program. Design: Qualitative and
quantitative study that includes a survey with close-ended and
open-ended questions. Setting: The study setting was a hospital in
Wisconsin. Participants: Participants (n = 105). Measures and Analysis:
Quantitative responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics in
Qualtrics and logistic regression in Statistical Analysis System.
Results: Sixty-three percent participated in the wellness incentivized
program because their employer offers them a reward; 52% said they
would participate without a reward; 48% feel like they must participate
in this year's program; and 34% feel like they would have to disclose
information about their health at or below the current reward level.
Conclusion: Income does not have a significant effect on whether
employees feel they must participate or disclose health information.
However, income has a significant effect on employee's beliefs about
whether or not employers should play an active role in improving the
health of their employees.

N2  - Background The prevention of nosocomial infections requires
participation from the patients themselves. In the past, however,
patients have been apprehensive to point out hygiene-relevant behaviour
to the personnel. In the project AHOI, the possibilities of active
patient involvement in infection prevention are identified, tested and
realized. The goal is a prevention strategy based upon three dimensions:
``adherence{''}, ``empowerment{''} and ``acceptance{''}. ``AHOI{''}
stands for the ``Activation of patients, persons in need of care and
care givers for a Hygiene-conscious participatiOn in Infection
control{''}. Results from the AHOI pilot study on the implementation of
a multimodal intervention bundle are reported. Methods In 2017, a
two-stage patient survey was conducted on two surgical wards for 14
weeks. In addition to the intervention bundle, acceptance, adherence and
empowerment regarding individual hygiene behaviour and perception were
evaluated. The bundle included an AHOI-welcome-box with an informational
and entertaining brochure and supportive incentives. Furthermore,
multiple visual materials like video presentations for patients' bedside
TV, posters and visual reminders in the patients' bedrooms and sanitary
facilities were installed. Results 179 respondents were surveyed at
admission, 139 at discharge and 133 at both time points. Almost all
respondents wanted to contribute to infection control. The AHOI project
was well accepted by patients. Two-thirds wanted to be more involved.
More than a third expected a negative response from staff after pointing
out hygiene deficiencies. Four respondents observed a deficiency in
hygiene with healthcare personnel and reported a very positive reaction
once this was communicated to the personnel. More than four-fifths of
the respondents felt well integrated and adequately informed post
intervention. The feeling of active involvement correlated significantly
with subjective participation and adherence to hygienic measures,
especially self-reported hand disinfection. Conclusion The results
demonstrated that the required inclusion of patients in infection
control is possible with AHOI. Active involvement of patients and
relatives is associated with improvements in adherence to infection
prevention measures.

N2  - Background: Questionnaires are valuable data collection instruments in
public health research, and can serve to pre-screen respondents for
suitability in future studies. Survey non-response leads to reduced
effective sample sizes and can decrease representativeness of the study
population, so high response rates are needed to minimize the risk of
bias. Here we present results on the success of different postal
questionnaire strategies at effecting response, and the effectiveness of
these strategies at recruiting participants for a field study on the
effects of aircraft noise on sleep.
Methods: In total, we mailed 17 rounds of 240 questionnaires (total n =
4080) to randomly selected households around Atlanta International
Airport. Different mailing rounds were varied in the length of the
questionnaire (11, 26 or 55 questions), survey incentive (gift card or
$2 cash), number of follow-up waves (0, 2 or 3), incentive for
participating in a 5-night in-home sleep study ($100, $150 or $200),
and address personalization.
Results: We received completed questionnaires from 407 respondents
(response rate 11.4%). Personalizing the address, enclosing a $2 cash
incentive with the initial questionnaire mailing and repeated follow-up
mailings were effective at increasing response rate. Despite the
increased expense of these approaches in terms of each household mailed,
the higher response rates meant that they were more cost-effective
overall for obtaining an equivalent number of responses. Interest in
participating in the field study decreased with age, but was unaffected
by the mailing strategies or cash incentives for field study
participation. The likelihood that a respondent would participate in the
field study was unaffected by survey incentive, survey length, number of
follow-up waves, field study incentive, age or sex.
Conclusions: Pre-issued cash incentives and sending follow-up waves
could maximize the representativeness and numbers of people from which
to recruit, and may be an effective strategy for improving recruitment
into field studies.

N2  - Flood preparedness of private households is regarded an essential
building block of integrated flood risk management. In the past decade,
numerous empirical studies have employed the protection motivation
theory (PMT) to explain flood mitigation behavior at the household
level. However, much of this research has produced mixed results and
could not consistently confirm the strength and direction of the
relationships between the PMT components. Based on a survey of 2,007
households in flood-prone areas, this study revisits the model structure
of the PMT by means of structural equation modeling. Compared to the
methods used in previous studies, this modeling technique allows us to
capture the PMT components in greater detail and to comprehensively test
their hypothesized interrelations. Our results point to two separate
routes leading to two different response types: A protective route from
coping appraisal to protective behavior, and a non-protective route from
threat appraisal to non-protective responses. Risk perception is not
found to be part of the protective route, neither are non-protective
responses confirmed to undermine protection motivation. The two separate
routes are observed consistently across all combinations of the six
protective and four non-protective responses assessed in this study. In
the light of encouraging private flood adaptation, risk communication
measures should specifically target the protective route and avoid
(accidentally) providing incentives that fall within the non-protective
route. This cross-sectional study, however, cannot establish how the two
routes interrelate over time. More experimental and longitudinal
research is required to address potential feedback effects and the role
of decision stages.

created {[}multi college bystander efficacy evaluation (mcBEE)]. Through
this consortium 24 public colleges were recruited and their choices
regarding bystander programming options were queried. Concurrently,
rates of violence perpetration and victimization were measured over 4
years among undergraduate students at each college. Description and
details of experiences in recruiting colleges into a college consortium,
addressing regulatory compliance, approaches to selecting and launching
college-wide surveys to undergraduate students across several large

N2  - Networks of roadside ditches criss-cross the landscape, and have played
a significant but previously unrecognized role in flooding and water
pollution. This study surveyed town and county highway professionals
across New York State (NYS) to determine their ditch management
practices. There was a 41% response rate from the 999 highway staff
surveyed, representing 54 of the 57 counties statewide. 36.8% of the
agencies reported using full scraping or reshaping without reseeding as
their primary method of ditch management and half scraped their ditches
on average once every 1 to 4 years. It is estimated that one-third to
one-half of the roadside ditches across upstate NYS are therefore in
fair to poor condition. This translates to thousands of miles of exposed
substrate vulnerable to storms, acting as a source of sediment and
pollution. Limited resources including time, labor, equipment, and money
were the primary reasons given for the practices used. Additional
challenges identified included interactions with landowners over
rights-of-way, farm-field drainage, and increasing frequency of
downpours. A comprehensive, state-wide program will be necessary to
actualize ditch improvement. It will require a complete toolbox of
strategies, from financial support and training to regulatory mandates
and penalties, and needs to include a ditch inventory system. Incentives
in the form of grants and shared services should be offered by state
agencies working collaboratively with local governments. Valuing highway
department managers as water stewards and supporting the improved
management of roadside ditches can provide an important new mechanism
for protecting NYS's water resources.

N2  - Objectives The primary objective was to assess the accuracy (calibration
and validation status) of digital blood pressure (BP) monitors used
within community pharmacy in England and the secondary objectives were
to assess the overall quality of the BP service by assessing service
prevalence, service utilisation and other in-service considerations.
Design A cross-sectional survey.
Setting Primary-care retail-pharmacies.
Participants 500 pharmacies that contribute to government
dispensing-data were invited by post to complete the survey. Private
contractors were excluded.
Interventions We conducted a questionnaire survey with a follow-up
(September 2018 to December 2018).
Results 109 responses were received. 61% (n=66) of responding
pharmacies provided a free BP check to their patients. 40 (61%)
pharmacies used recommended validated clinical metres, 6 (9%) had
failed validation and 20 (30%) provided too little information to
enable us to determine their monitors status.
Conclusions Responding pharmacies were able to provide useful BP
monitoring services to their patients, though quality enhancements need
to be implemented. Majority of pharmacies use validated BP monitors,
however, there was a lack of range of cuff sizes, variation in
replacement and calibration of monitors and apparent absence of such
practice in a minority of pharmacies alongside variation in training
standards. We noted higher frequency of BP screening in the most
deprived postcodes.
We recommend in-service redesign and delivery improvements, and suggest
professional bodies and researchers work together to create clearer
frameworks for front-line practitioners, creating appropriate incentives
to facilitate this service redesign.
Funders and policy setters should consider the value added to the
National Health Service and other healthcare agencies of such screening
by pharmacy providers both nationally and internationally. It has the
potential to reduce complications of undiagnosed hypertension and the
medicines burden that it creates. Future work should examine the impact
of pharmacist-led BP screening on patients.

N2  - Simple Summary The demand for products with higher farm animal welfare
(FAW) standards is increasing within the European Union. In response,
representatives from agricultural associations, the slaughtering
industry and food retailing started the industry solution Initiative
Animal Welfare (IAW) in 2015 with the aim of establishing higher FAW
standards on a broad basis in both poultry and pig production in
Germany. In contrast to other available animal welfare programs (AWPs),
the IAW receives considerable support from farmers and enjoys a large
number of participants. This article focuses on the question why the IAW
is gaining positive resonance among German livestock farmers. Applying
partial least squares path modeling to analyze the determinants of
farmers' intention to participate in the IAW, we found that the
determinants performance expectancy, social influence, facilitating
conditions, hedonic motivation, price value, trust and experiences with
the IAW have a significant influence on the behavioral intention to
participate in the IAW program. It is shown that the farmers' hedonic
motivation has the greatest impact on participation. The prospect of
improving the image of pig fattening and the economic incentive motivate
many farmers to participate. Additionally, many farmers confirmed that
they enjoy providing a more superior welfare status to their pigs. The
social determinant was also identified as a strong influencing factor.
The results suggest that participation in AWPs could be improved by
appropriate remuneration and measures promoting farmers' intrinsic
motivation to engage in AWPs.
Abstract Farmers are considered a highly important stakeholder group for
the successful implementation of higher farm animal welfare (FAW)
standards, but so far little is known about their attitudes and the
determinants of their participation in programs that request higher FAW
standards. To close this research gap, fattening pig farmers in Germany
were questioned via a large-scale online survey in 2018 (n = 239). Based
on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, a partial
least squares path modeling (PLS) was run. Results show that the
expected performance as well as the expected costs associated with the
Initiative Animal Welfare (IAW) substantially influence fattening pig
farmers' behavioral intention to participate in the IAW. Furthermore,
the decision is influenced by social determinants and facilitating
conditions such as deadweight effects. Farmers' hedonic motivation, fair
remuneration and previous experiences with the establishment of higher
FAW standards can influence their intention to take part in the IAW. In
addition, farmers' trust in the program is a major determinant. There
are also moderating variables such as age and work experience that
influence farmers' intention to take part in the IAW. Our results have
important managerial implications for the IAW and can help to design
further tailor-made animal welfare programs (AWPs) that fulfill the
requirements of both fattening pig farmers and the broader public not
only in Germany but the European Union.

N2  - Background The use of electronic medical record (EMR) is anticipated to
bring benefits for patients, physicians, and organizations. But limited
physicians' acceptance of EMR presents a serious threat to its effective
implementation. Objectives The current study incorporates technology
acceptance model (TAM) with two antecedents, gender, and clinical
specialty and one context-specific factor, financial incentives, to
identify the factors that influence physicians' intention to use EMR in
Taiwan. Methods The survey methodology was used to collect data from the
physicians, working in the regional hospital that had implemented EMR
system. A total of 119 out of 213 questionnaires returned in a response
rate of 56%. But four responses were considered ineffective due to
missing values. The structural equation modeling (SEM) technique was
employed to analyze the research framework. Results The partial least
squares (PLS) regression indicated that three factors perceived
usefulness, financial incentives, and attitude toward using EMR
significantly affect physicians' intention. But concerning perceived
ease of use (PEOU), an insignificant path coefficient was reported.
Additionally, regression analysis showed gender, and clinical specialty
positively influenced physicians' intention to use EMR. Discussion and
Conclusions The proposed research framework contributes to the
conclusive explanation for interpreting physicians' intention to use
EMR. Physicians generally have a higher level of computer literacy.
Therefore, the factor of PEOU could not be critical regarding adopting
new health information technology (HIT). This study also brings
perspectives from the gender, and clinical differences have primarily
been missing in the literature of the physicians' intention to use HIT.
In doing so, it infers how gender, and clinical specialty, may
complement (and in some instances, reinforce) the influence of
technological and attitudinal factors of HIT use. Thus, health care
providers must take these factors into consideration in the development
and validation of the theories regarding the intention to use EMR.

incentives. Specifically, we considered the impact of winning an initial
non-guaranteed survey incentive on students' response to future surveys
(both with and without guaranteed incentives). We found that winning or,
more importantly, losing the initial incentive predicted future survey
response even when future surveys guaranteed a prize. These and other
findings are reviewed, adding to the knowledge base of how to most
efficiently encourage student survey response in light of financial

sent to participating ICUS.
Results: Survey was answered by 366 ICUs from 17 CCRNs (median response

(n=133; 70%), the collaboration with experts (n=284; 85%), and
improving practices (n=286; 86%) are incentives reported to belong to a
CCRN.
Conclusions: Despite different organizations, CCRN share similar
ventures including the value of improving quality of critical care
delivery. Participating ICUs share several structural and managerial

N2  - This paper presents a systematic way of understanding and modeling
traveler behavior in response to on-demand mobility services. We
explicitly consider the sequential and yet inter-connected
decision-making stages specific to on-demand service usage. The
framework includes a hybrid choice model for service subscription, and
three logit mixture models with inter-consumer heterogeneity for the
service access, menu product choice and opt-out choice. Different models
are connected by feeding logsums. The proposed modeling framework is
essential for accounting the impacts of real-time on-demand system's
dynamics on traveler behaviors and capturing consumer heterogeneity,
thus being greatly relevant for integrations in multi-modal dynamic
simulators. The methodology is applied to a case study of an innovative
personalized on-demand real-time system which incentivizes travelers to
select more sustainable travel options. The data for model estimation is
collected through a smartphone-based context-aware stated preference
survey. Through model estimation, lower values of time are observed when
the respondents opt to use the reward system. The perception of
incentives and schedule delay by different population segments are
quantified. These results are fundamental in setting the ground for
different behavioral scenarios of such a new on-demand system. The
proposed methodology is flexible to be applied to model other on-demand
mobility services such as ride-hailing services and the emerging
mobility as a service.

N2  - Background Strong consensus exists on the need to expand participation
of URM doctoral students in STEM fields, to increase their retention,
reduce their average time to degree, and provide these students with the
preparation necessary to compete for faculty positions. This paper
provides a model for implementing effective strategies to support the
success of URM STEM graduate students across a system with various types
of institutions. An innovative professional development, participation
incentive, and community building program for underrepresented minority
(URM) Graduate students in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics) fields was instrumental in preparing them to secure
academic positions, navigating graduate school successfully, and form a
support network that helped them excel at the next level. The program
provided sustained support and several activities in a collaborative
environment for 84 Ph.D. and 84 Master's students, in over 43 graduate
programs. Data were collected using evaluation questionnaires containing
open-ended responses and responses to specific items sent to the
students after each activity, and a survey seeking their feedback on the
program. Results In only 4 years, the program helped 13 students to
secure faculty or post-doctoral positions, and improved the opinion of
the professoriate career as thirteen students transitioned to the Ph.D.
program and are now more interested in applying for faculty positions.
The program was successful in developing and sustaining large-scale,
distributed, yet interconnected STEM communities among the diverse
Alliance system institutions and increased participation (from 58 in
2013 to 98 in 2017), reduced barriers, and promoted the success of URM
doctoral students preparing for careers in the professoriate.
Conclusions We have developed activities that connected students and
faculty across institutions, providing multiple paths to the
professoriate that align with students' diverse academic career
aspirations. This article illustrates that professional development,
incentives, and community building interventions are essential in
generating URM STEM education transformation.

N2  - Many colleges and universities conduct web-based campus climate surveys
to understand the prevalence and nature of sexual assault among their
students. When designing and fielding a web survey to measure a
sensitive topic like sexual assault, methodological decisions, including
the length of the field period and the use or amount of an incentive,
can affect the representativeness of the respondent sample leading to
biased or imprecise estimates. This study uses data from the Campus
Climate Survey Validation Study (CCSVS) to assess how the interaction
between field period length and survey incentive amount affects
nonresponse, sample representativeness, and the precision of survey
estimates. Research suggests that using robust incentives gives
potential survey respondents a reason to complete the survey beyond
their intrinsic motivation to do so. Likewise, extending the field
period gives more time to people who may be less intrinsically motivated
to complete the survey. Both serve to increase sample size and
representativeness, minimize bias, and improve estimate precision.
Schools, however, sometimes lack the time and/or resources for both a
robust incentive and a lengthy field period, and this study examines the
extent to which the potential negative impacts of not using one can be
mitigated by the presence of the other. Findings indicate that target
response rates can be achieved using a smaller incentive if the field
period is lengthy but, even with a lengthy field period, the use of a
smaller incentive can result in biased estimates due to a lack of
representativeness. Conversely, when a robust incentive is used and
weights are developed to adjust for nonresponse, a shorter field period
will not have a significant impact on point estimates, but the estimates
will be less precise due to fewer respondents participating in the
survey.

N2  - Background Although the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) created
new incentives for organizations to improve healthcare value,
Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) have achieved only modest
reductions in the use of low-value care. Objective To assess ACO
engagement of clinicians and whether engagement was associated with
clinicians' reported difficulty implementing recommendations against
low-value care. Design Cross-sectional survey of ACO clinicians in 2018.
Participants 1289 clinicians in the Physician Organization of Michigan
ACO, including generalist physicians (18%), internal medicine
specialists (16%), surgeons (10%), other physician specialists (27%),
and advanced practice providers (29%). Response rate was 34%. Main
Measures Primary exposures included clinicians' participation in ACO
decision-making, awareness of ACO incentives, perceived influence on
practice, and perceived quality improvement. Our primary outcome was
clinicians' reported difficulty implementing recommendations against
low-value care. Results Few clinicians participated in the decision to
join the ACO (3%). Few clinicians were aware of ACO incentives,
including knowing the ACO was accountable for both spending and quality
(23%), successfully lowered spending (9%), or faced upside risk only
(3%). Few agreed (moderately or strongly) the ACO changed compensation
(20%), practice (19%), or feedback (15%) or that it improved care
coordination (17%) or inappropriate care (13%). Clinicians reported
they had difficulty following recommendations against low-value care
18% of the time; clinicians reported patients had difficulty accepting
recommendations 36% of the time. Increased ACO awareness (1 standard
deviation {[}SD]) was associated with decreased difficulty (- 2.3
percentage points) implementing recommendations (95% confidence
interval {[}CI] - 3.8, - 0.7), as was perceived quality improvement (1
SD increase, - 2.1 percentage points, 95% CI, - 3.4, - 0.8).
Participation in ACO decision-making and perceived influence on practice
were not associated with recommendation implementation. Conclusions
Clinicians participating in a large Medicare ACO were broadly unaware of
and unengaged with ACO objectives and activities. Whether low clinician
engagement limits ACO efforts to reduce low-value care warrants further
longitudinal study.

N2  - This study uses an online survey experiment to test whether the pairing
of profit-seeking with mission-related programs in the social sector
attracts or deters donations from individual donors. We test
individuals' response to three types of profit incentives allowed under
current U.S. public policy: (1) non-distributed profit to an
organization, which is allowed for nonprofit entities; (2) profit to the
organization's equity investors and owners, which is allowed under
for-profit social enterprise governance charters; and (3) profit to
lending investors, which is introduced by social impact bonds, a
pay-for-success policy tool. We test trust theory, under which profit
incentives deter donors against entrepreneurial orientation (EO) theory,
which suggests that donors are attracted to organizations that use
innovative, market-driven programs. Findings indicate support for both
theories, but the support depends on how the specific profit incentive
is structured. Donors support organizations that use profit-generating
social enterprise programs-but only when the profits are
non-distributable; donors' support is significantly lower for social
enterprises in which owners and equity investors may profit. Importantly
however, this negative effect is not found for pay-for-success policy
tools where lending investors, rather than equity investors and owners,
receive profits.

N2  - Economists and philosophers disagree about the concept of choice used in
economics. Some behavioural economists argue that economic models of
choice will improve as they become more and more psychologically
realistic. Don Ross argues that this argument fails because its hidden
assumption - that the economic concept of choice is the same as the
psychological counterpart - is false. Ross conjectures that the economic
concept of choice concerns a population-scale pattern of behavioural
changes in response to incentives. We conduct a survey experiment to
test two predictions that Ross's conjecture generates. The statistical
analysis of our data confirms our predictions, although with some
qualifications. In interpreting our results, we distinguish two versions
of commonsensible realism, strong and weak, and propose the weak one as
a plausible explanation of our results. Weak commonsensible realism also
produces further testable hypotheses. Some methodological implications
of our study are discussed.

N2  - IMPORTANCE Using social media to recruit participants is a common and
cost-effective practice. Willingness to participate (WTP) in biomedical
research is a function of trust in the scientific team, which is closely
tied to the source of funding and institutional connections.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether WTP and willingness to share social media
data are associated with the type of research team and online
recruitment platform.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This mixed-methods longitudinal survey
and qualitative study was conducted over 2 points (T1 and T2) using
Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform. Participants were US adults
aged 18 years or older who use at least 1 social media platform.
Recruitment was stratified to match race/ethnicity proportions of the
2010 US Census. The volunteer sample consisted of 914 participants at
T1, and 655 participants completed the follow-up survey 5 months later
(T2).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Outcomes were (1) past experience with online
research and sharing social media data for research; (2) WTP in research
advertised online; (3) WTP in a study sponsored by a pharmaceutical
company, a university, or a federal agency; and (4) willingness to share
social media data. Opinions were solicited regarding the European
Union's General Data Protection Regulation statute, which came into
effect between T1 and T2.
RESULTS Of 914 participants completing the first survey (T1), 604
(66.1%) were aged 18 to 39 years and 494 (54.0%) were female. Of
these, 655 participants (71.7%) responded at T2. While 680 participants
(74.4%) indicated WTP in biomedical research, only 454 (49.3%) were
willing to share their social media data. Participants were
significantly less likely to participate in federally sponsored (odds
ratio {[}OR], 0.58; 95% CI, 0.51-0.64; P <.001) or pharmaceutical
company (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.53-0.66; P <.001) research than
university-led studies. They were also less likely to share their social
medial data for federal (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.58-0.72; P <.001) or
pharmaceutical company (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.44-0.56; P <.001) research
compared with academic studies. Willingness to participate in
pharmaceutical company-led research decreased 11.89% from T1 to T2 (OR
for T2, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.54-0.77; P <.001). Reasons for WTP were
interest in furthering science, financial incentives, trust in the
organization, and data security. While 63.0% of respondents reported
seeing new privacy policy emails related to the General Data Protection
Regulation law, only 27.1% indicated this positively influenced their
WTP. Thematic analysis of responses indicated that WTP may improve with
stronger data security measures.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study suggests that researchers may see
reduced online research participation and data sharing, particularly for
research conducted outside academia.

N2  - We examine the incidence on household consumption of the introduction of
tax incentives to retirement saving. First, using data from a panel of
tax returns we document that most contributions to pension funds are by
older/high-income individuals. Then we use panel data from a consumption
survey spanning the period 1985 and 1991 to find that there is
substantial heterogeneity in the response of household saving to tax
incentives. While the overall amount of new saving we estimate is
limited (at most 19 cents per euro contributed on average), saving
responses differ substantially across age groups: among the group of
households between 56 and 65 years of age, the group that most actively
contributed to the plan, there are very small consumption changes; among
the group of households between 46 and 55 years of age, the decrease in
(mostly durable) consumption expenditures is much larger.

N2  - In this study, a preliminary list of drivers, barriers, and enablers to
end-of-life management of photovoltaic panels and battery energy storage
systems obtained from a systematic literature review was firstly
evaluated and then expanded through an iterative expert review process.
Subsequently, a questionnaire survey was administered in Australia to
elicit stakeholder perceptions on each driver, barrier, and enabler
factor. A total of 57 complete responses was obtained. A two-step
cluster analysis was performed to compare the perceived drivers,
barriers, and enablers between four stakeholder categories including
research/education institutions, product stewardship arrangement (PSA)
parties, governments, and consultants. Findings indicated that there is
a high degree of agreement among stakeholders on various drivers,
barriers, and enablers; however, some factors exhibited differences. It
appeared that all stakeholders were driven to address triple bottom line
issues, however, research/education institutions put more emphasis on
the economic and environmental drivers. Stakeholders reported the lack
of profitability, unavailability of regulations and incentives, as well
as a lack of awareness of safe disposal options, as being the most
significant barriers. Only government respondents recognised the current
lack of on-shore recycling infrastructures as a critical barrier.
Introducing a product stewardship scheme, implementing business models
for collection, economic incentives, as well as developing recycling
technologies and infrastructures were regarded as the most important
enablers. Policy and practice implications and recommendations were also
discussed in this study.

N2  - Incentive programs to encourage landowners to protect habitat should be
carefully designed to avoid motivation crowding: basically, replacing
intrinsic reasons such as a land ethic with extrinsic ones like
payments. Little research on motivation crowding tests real programs,
and no such work has been done in Canada. We surveyed farmers in Nova
Scotia in 2017 to explore whether participation in a new incentive
program called Wood Turtle Strides, or knowledge about a similar
incentive program potentially available in the future, would alter
reported motivations to use riparian setbacks and buffers. Motivations
to use setbacks or buffers were heavily intrinsic across all four survey
cohorts: wildlife stewardship and sacrifice motivated actions more than
social pressures. We were not able to statistically test for
motivational crowding due to low program uptake and thus post-program
survey responses, but there was no evidence of second-hand crowding:
farmers being motivated by hearing about a program in an adjacent
jurisdiction. Findings point to the significance of wildlife stewardship
for many farmers, and persistent resistance to conservation among
others, as well as a risk of low additionality. More post-program
research is necessary to fully understand the program's net impact on
motivations and conservation.

N2  - Background: The association between health literacy and health care
costs, particularly for hospitalizations and emergency room services,
has been previously observed. Health information interventions aimed at
addressing the negative impacts of inadequate health literacy are
needed. The MedEncentive Mutual Accountability and Information Therapy
(MAIT) Program is a Web-based system designed to improve health and
lower costs by aligning patient-doctor incentives.
Objective: In this mixed methods study of a Web-based patient-doctor
aligned-incentive, information therapy program conducted in an
1800-member employee health plan, we aimed to (1) determine the
program's quantitative impact on hospitalization and emergency room
utilization and costs, and (2) assess survey responses about the
program's perceived value.
Methods: We used a mixed methods, single within-group, pre-post,
descriptive study design. We analyzed quantitative data using pre-post
mean utilization and cost differences and summarized the data using
descriptive statistics. We used open-ended electronic survey items to
collect descriptive data and analyzed them using thematic content
analysis.
Results: Hospitalizations and emergency room visits per 1000 decreased
32% (26.5/82.4) and 14% (31.3/219.9), respectively, after we
implemented the program in 2015-2017, relative to 2013-2014.
Correspondingly, the plan's annual per capita expenditures declined US
$675 (95% CI US $470-865), or 10.8% ($675/$6260), after program
implementation in 2015-2017 (US $5585 in 2013-2014 dollars), relative
to the baseline years of 2013-2014 (US $6260; P<.05). Qualitative
findings suggested that respondents valued the program, benefiting from
its educational and motivational aspects to better self-manage their
health.
Conclusions: Analyses suggested that the reported reductions in
hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and costs were associated with
the program. Qualitative findings indicated that targeted users
perceived value in participating in the MAIT Program. Further research
with controls is needed to confirm these outcomes and more completely
understand the health improvement and cost-containment capabilities of
this Web-based health information, patient-doctor, aligned-incentive
program.

N2  - Maintaining high response rates over time is critical for the integrity
of longitudinal studies. A best practice for encouraging survey
participation in cross-sectional studies is to send sample members a
pre-incentive with the survey invitation. However, in longitudinal
studies this may change sample members' future expectations of
incentives. Instead researchers can use a prenotice to remind
longitudinal sample members of the study and inform them of the upcoming
wave. A unique greeting card format for a prenotice was experimentally
tested against a $10 pre-incentive in the longitudinal study Add
Health. The prenotice card, which thanked sample members for their
ongoing contributions to the study over the last 20-plus years,
significantly increased response rates and decreased survey response
times over the 12-month course of data collection compared to the
control. At the end of data collection, the prenotice card was equally
effective as a $10 pre-incentive. However, in the first month of data
collection, the combination of the prenotice card and pre-incentive was
the most effective approach, suggesting that the best approach may
depend on the planned duration of data collection. Additionally, sample
members who did not participate in a previous wave had higher response
rates this wave with the pre-incentive compared to the control. The
findings suggest that long-term longitudinal study participants may
evaluate researchers' gratitude as a type of benefit on par with
monetary incentives, offering researchers opportunities to reduce
incentive costs, but this may differ based on previous wave
participation.

N2  - Background The global proliferation of mobile phones offers opportunity
for improved non-communicable disease (NCD) data collection by
interviewing participants using interactive voice response (IVR)
surveys. We assessed whether airtime incentives can improve cooperation
and response rates for an NCD IVR survey in Bangladesh and Uganda.
Methods Participants were randomised to three arms: a) no incentive, b)
1X incentive or c) 2X incentive, where X was set to airtime of 50
Bangladesh Taka (US$0.60) and 5000 Ugandan Shillings (UGX; US$1.35).
Adults aged 18 years and older who had a working mobile phone were
sampled using random digit dialling. The primary outcomes, cooperation
and response rates as defined by the American Association of Public
Opinion Research, were analysed using log-binomial regression model.
Results Between 14 June and 14 July 2017, 440 262 phone calls were made
in Bangladesh. The cooperation and response rates were, respectively,
28.8% (353/1227) and 19.2% (580/3016) in control, 39.2% (370/945) and
23.9% (507/2120) in 50 Taka and 40.0% (362/906) and 24.8% (532/2148)
in 100 Taka incentive groups. Cooperation and response rates,
respectively, were significantly higher in both the 50 Taka (risk ratio
(RR) 1.36, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.53) and (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.38),
and 100 Taka groups (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.56) and (RR 1.29, 95%
CI 1.16 to 1.43), as compared with the controls. In Uganda, 174 157
phone calls were made from 26 March to 22 April 2017. The cooperation
and response rates were, respectively, 44.7% (377/844) and 35.2%
(552/1570) in control, 57.6% (404/701) and 39.3% (508/1293) in 5000
UGX and 58.8% (421/716) and 40.3% (535/1328) in 10 000 UGX groups.
Cooperation and response rates were significantly higher, respectively
in the 5000 UGX (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.42) and (RR 1.12, 95% CI
1.02 to 1.23), and 10 000 UGX groups (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.45) and
(RR 1.15, 95% 1.04 to 1.26), as compared with the control group.
Conclusion In two diverse settings, the provision of an airtime
incentive significantly improved both the cooperation and response rates
of an IVR survey, with no significant difference between the two
incentive amounts.

SWITZERLAND, AUG 13-17, 2017
N2  - Background There is inequity and maldistribution of the surgical
workforce in Nigeria. Most specialists practice in second- and
third-level hospitals often located in urban or semi-urban areas. A
knowledge of the proposed choice of practice location of surgical
trainees and the factors that influence the choice could provide insight
into future surgical coverage and help in planning and policy-making.
Methods This is a cross-sectional survey of surgical trainees attending
the mandatory integrated revision and update course of the West African
College of Surgeons. Anonymous structured questionnaires were
self-administered to 200 trainees, of which 143 completed the
questionnaires. Results The response rate was 71.5%. One hundred and
six (74.1%) trainees preferred to work in a tertiary hospital on
completion of training, 13 (9.1%) were in a Private Hospital, and 16
(11.2%) were undecided. Nearly all tertiary hospitals are in urban or
semi-urban towns. The commonest factors influencing choice of practice
location were proximity to family 19 (13.3%), proximity to hometown 11
(7.6%), availability of working facilities 10 (6.9%), income 7 (4.9%)
and underserved areas 7 (4.9%). Of 122 (85.3%) trainees who agreed to
work for some period each year (ranging from 1 week to 6 months) in a
rural setting, 42 (29.3%) would do it without additional financial
incentive. Conclusion The choice of most surgical trainees not to work
in a rural setting as specialists would exacerbate the ongoing surgical
workforce maldistribution and inequity in Nigeria. However, the
willingness of 85.3% to provide periodic rural surgical coverage could
be leveraged in planning of initiatives to address the maldistribution.

N2  - Background: There is a need to deliver smoking cessation support at a
population level, both in developed and developing countries. Studies on
internet-based and mobile phone based smoking cessation interventions
have shown that these methods can be as effective as other methods of
support, and they can have a wider reach at a lower cost.
Objective: This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to compare, on a
population level, the efficacy of an identical, tailored smoking
cessation intervention delivered by mobile text messaging versus email.
Methods: We conducted a nationwide 2-arm, double-blinded, fully
automated RCT, close to a real-world setting, in Norway. We did not
offer incentives to increase participation and adherence or to decrease
loss to follow-up. We recruited users of the website, slutta.no, an
open, free, multi-component Norwegian internet-based smoking cessation
program, from May 2010 until October 2012. Enrolled smokers were
considered as having completed a time point regardless of their response
status if it was 1, 3, 6, or 12 months post cessation. We assessed 7315
participants using the following inclusion criteria: knowledge of the
Norwegian language, age 16 years or older, ownership of a Norwegian cell
phone, having an email account, current cigarette smoker, willingness to
set a cessation date within 14 days (mandatory), and completion of a
baseline questionnaire for tailoring algorithms. Altogether, 6137
participants were eligible for the study and 4378 participants (71.33%)
provided informed consent to participate in the smoking cessation trial.
We calculated the response rates for participants at the completed 1, 3,
6, and 12 months post cessation. For each arm, we conducted an
intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis for each completed time point. The
main outcome was 7-day self-reported point prevalence abstinence (PPA)
at the completed 6 months post cessation. We calculated effect size of
the 7-day self-reported PPA in the text message arm compared with the
email arm as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs for the 4 time points post
cessation.
Results: At 6 months follow-up, 21.06% (384/1823) of participants in
the text message arm and 18.62% (333/1788) in the email arm responded
(P=.07) to the surveys. In the ITT analysis, 11.46% (209/1823) of
participants in the text message arm compared with 10.96% (196/1788) in
the email arm (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86-1.30) reported to have achieved 7
days PPA.
Conclusions: This nationwide, double-blinded, large, fully automated RCT
found that 1 in 9 enrolled smokers reported 7-day PPA in both arms, 6
months post cessation. Our study found that identical smoking cessation
interventions delivered by mobile text messaging and email may be
equally successful at a population level.

N2  - This study seeks to determine what participants prefer when taking
online surveys with regard to conjoint design (number of concepts per
screen) and format for grid questions. Respondents were mixed on their
preference for two versus three concepts per screen. However, importance
scores for incentive amount and type reversed when taking a conjoint
exercise with two concepts per screen versus three concepts per screen.
Participants seemed to focus more on incentives when presented with
three concepts per screen than when presented with two concepts per
screen. This finding was not expected and implications are discussed. In
addition, the use of radio buttons versus drop-down menus in grid style
questions was also explored. Respondents preferred radio buttons, and
the means (repeated measures) were higher for responses for radio
buttons than drop-down menus.

N2  - Purpose: To understand factors influencing the choice and ranking of
Interventional Radiology (IR) training programs among a cohort of
medical students and diagnostic radiology residents pursuing careers in
IR.
Materials and methods: An IRB approved, 34 question online survey
(surveymonkey.com ) evaluated the impact of twenty-two different factors
and demographics on IR training program selection for medical students
and residents. The factors analyzed included programmatic features,
location characteristics, academic reputation, program size,
benefits/financial incentives, emphasis on clinical care, and future job
opportunities. Comparison of Likert scale responses between medical
students and residents were performed by using unpaired two-sample
t-tests.
Results: 181 (145 male, 35 female) individuals responded to the survey,
74 medical students (40.9%) and 107 residents (59.1%). Medical
students and residents both selected variety of IR cases as the most
important and highest rated factor when choosing an IR program. Medical
students ranked availability of a mentor (p = .03), inpatient
consultation service (p = .003), outpatient clinic experience (p =
.003), and ICU rotation experience (p < .001) significantly higher.
Residents rated job placement/accomplishments of prior fellows (p = .03)
and opinion of spouse/significant others (p = .002) significantly higher
than medical students.
Conclusions: The top rated factors are similar among medical students
and residents however medical students value the clinical aspects of the
program (ICU experience, inpatient consultation service, outpatient
clinic) more than residents. Residents placed more value on job
placement opportunities in selecting an IR program.

N2  - We examine the charitable giving behavior of warm-glow givers in
response to the same donation incentive structure, but with formally
different schemes. At this aim we implement a large online survey
(N=1655) using the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform. First, we elicit and
measure warm-glow giving. Then, we employ a between-subjects design in
which each warm-glow donor (N=881) is randomly assigned to one of two
treatment groups that differ for the subsidy (rebate or matching) and is
asked to make a series of allocation decisions between himself and a
charity of his choice. The results show that contributions are
significantly more responsive to matching (-1.15) than to rebate
subsidies (-0.17). Moreover, we provide evidence that, under rebate,
price elasticity decreases as the warm-glow magnitude increases. For
weak warm-glow givers, price elasticity is double that for strong
warm-glow donors. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Predatory journals fail to fulfill the tenets of biomedical
publication: peer review, circulation, and access in perpetuity. Despite
increasing attention in the lay and scientific press, no studies have
directly assessed the perceptions of the authors or editors involved.
Objective: Our objective was to understand the motivation of authors in
sending their work to potentially predatory journals. Moreover, we aimed
to understand the perspective of journal editors at journals cited as
potentially predatory.
Methods: Potential online predatory journals were randomly selected
among 350 publishers and their 2204 biomedical journals. Author and
editor email information was valid for 2227 total potential
participants. A survey for authors and editors was created in an
iterative fashion and distributed. Surveys assessed attitudes and
knowledge about predatory publishing. Narrative comments were invited.
Results: A total of 249 complete survey responses were analyzed. A total
of 40% of editors (17/43) surveyed were not aware that they were listed
as an editor for the particular journal in question. A total of 21.8%
of authors (45/206) confirmed a lack of peer review. Whereas 77%
(33/43) of all surveyed editors were at least somewhat familiar with
predatory journals, only 33.0% of authors (68/206) were somewhat
familiar with them (P<.001). Only 26.2% of authors (54/206) were aware
of Beall's list of predatory journals versus 49% (21/43) of editors
(P<.001). A total of 30.1% of authors (62/206) believed their
publication was published in a predatory journal. After defining
predatory publishing, 87.9% of authors (181/206) surveyed would not
publish in the same journal in the future.
Conclusions: Authors publishing in suspected predatory journals are
alarmingly uninformed in terms of predatory journal quality and
practices. Editors' increased familiarity with predatory publishing did
little to prevent their unwitting listing as editors. Some suspected
predatory journals did provide services akin to open access publication.
Education, research mentorship, and a realignment of research incentives
may decrease the impact of predatory publishing.

N2  - There is growing interest in developing effective interventions to
manage socially and environmentally damaging conservation conflicts.
There are a variety of intervention strategies that can be applied in
various contexts, but the reasons one type of intervention is chosen
over another remain underexplored. We surveyed conservation researchers
and practitioners (n = 427) to explore how characteristics of conflicts
and characteristics of decision makers influence recommendations to
alleviate conservation conflict. Using a full-factorial design, we
experimentally manipulated 3 aspects of the descriptions of 8 different
wildlife-conflict scenarios (development status of the conflict country,
conflict framing, and legality of killing wild animals) and recorded
which of 5 intervention types (wildlife impact reduction, awareness,
enforcement, economic incentives, or stakeholder engagement) respondents
prioritized. We also recorded information on respondents' demographic
and disciplinary backgrounds. Stakeholder-based interventions were
recommended most often in the survey and in written feedback. However,
when we fitted multinomial mixed logit models with fully completed
scenario responses (n = 411), recommendations were influenced by small
changes in the details of conflict and differed according to respondent
characteristics. Enforcement and awareness interventions were
prioritized relatively more for conflicts in more highly developed
nations and by respondents with more natural science backgrounds and
relatively less experience with conflict. Contrastingly, economic
interventions were prioritized more when wildlife killing was described
as illegal. Age, gender, and development status of the respondent's home
country also predicted some intervention decisions. Further,
interrogating the influences shaping conservation decision making will
further helps in the development of evidence-informed interventions.

N2  - A growing body of research has found that linking products to charitable
causes enhances sellers' reputations. This paper tests with a field
experiment whether the use of the option of giving to charity to signal
genuine intentions in mail surveys can enhance the effectiveness of
small financial incentives. We find that they do significantly increase
individuals' responsiveness to the differences in the amount of the
incentives. Cash incentives lead to an approximated constant response
rate. Adding the option to donate the incentive to a specific charity
significantly increases the effect of the financial incentive on the
likelihood of responding.

N2  - Objective Guidelines for cancer screening have been debated and are
followed to varying degrees. We wanted to study whether and why doctors
recommend disease-specific cancer screening to their patients.
Design Our cross-sectional survey used a postal questionnaire. The data
were examined with descriptive methods and binary logistic regression.
Setting We surveyed doctors working in all health services.
Participants Our participants comprised a representative sample of
Norwegian doctors in 2014/2015.
Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary outcome is whether
doctors reported recommending their patients get screening for cancers
of the breast, colorectum, lung, prostate, cervix and ovaries. We
examined doctors' characteristics predicting adherence to the
guidelines, including gender, age, and work in specialist or general
practice. The secondary outcomes are reasons given for recommending or
not recommending screening for breast and prostate cancer.
Results Our response rate was 75% (1158 of 1545). 94% recommended
screening for cervical cancer, 89% for breast cancer (both established
as national programmes), 42% for colorectal cancer (upcoming national
programme), 41% for prostate cancer, 21% for ovarian cancer and 17%
for lung cancer (not recommended by health authorities). General
practitioners (GPs) adhered to guidelines more than other doctors. Early
detection was the most frequent reason for recommending screening; false
positives and needless intervention were the most frequent reasons for
not recommending it.
Conclusions A large majority of doctors claimed that they recommended
cancer screening in accordance with national guidelines. Among doctors
recommending screening contrary to the guidelines, GPs did so to a
lesser degree than other specialties. Different expectations of doctors'
roles could be a possible explanation for the variations in practice and
justifications. The effectiveness of governing instruments, such as
guidelines, incentives or reporting measures, can depend on which
professional role(s) a doctor is loyal to, and policymakers should be
aware of these different roles in clinical governance.

N2  - Objectives To evaluate a county-wide deincentivisation of the Quality
and Outcomes Framework (QOF) payment scheme for UK General Practice
(GP).
Setting In 2014, National Health Service England signalled a move
towards devolution of QOF to Clinical Commissioning Groups. Fifty-five
GPs in Somerset established the Somerset Practice Quality Scheme
(SPQS)-a deincentivisation of QOF-with the goal of redirecting resources
towards Person Centred Coordinated Care (P3C), especially for those with
long-term conditions (LTCs). We evaluated the impact on processes and
outcomes of care from April 2016 to March 2017.
Participants and design The evaluation used data from 55 SPQS practices
and 17 regional control practices for three survey instruments. We
collected patient experiences ('P3C-EQ'; 2363 returns from patients with
1+LTC; 36% response rate), staff experiences ('P3C-practitioner'; 127
professionals) and organisational data ('P3C-OCT'; 36 of 55 practices at
two time points, 65% response rate; 17 control practices). Hospital
Episode Statistics emergency admission data were analysed for 2014-2017
for ambulatory-sensitive conditions across Somerset using interrupted
time series.
Results Patient and practitioner experiences were similar in SPQS versus
control practices. However, discretion from QOF incentives resulted in
time savings in the majority of practices, and SPQS practice data showed
a significant increase in P3C oriented organisational processes, with a
moderate effect size (Wilcoxon signed rank test; p=0.01; r=0.42).
Analysis of transformation plans and organisational data suggested
stronger federation-level agreements and informal networks, increased
multidisciplinary working, reallocation of resources for other
healthcare professionals and changes to the structure and timings of GP
appointments. No disbenefits were detected in admission data.
Conclusion The SPQS scheme leveraged time savings and reduced
administrative burden via discretionary removal of QOF incentives,
enabling practices to engage actively in a number of schemes aimed at
improving care for people with LTCs. We found no differences in the
experiences of patients or healthcare professionals between SPQS and
control practices.

N2  - Geography is fostering a diverse range of methodologies that engage the
more-than-human dimensions of research. Debates surround the efficacy of
both longstanding and emergent methodological approaches in grappling
with how to do more-than-human geography. Much attention has been given
to the methodological implications of theoretical debates that evoke
distributed agency and calls to ``enliven{''} research. To date,
however, questionnaire surveys have not been considered as part of these
deliberations. Survey response rates are normally reported as
percentages, with scholarly attention focusing on how question design,
financial incentives, and delivery format may influence human engagement
with the questionnaire. Little attention has been paid to questionnaire
survey methods in or for more-than-human research. Inversely, there is
also little discussion of the agency of non-human bodies, processes, and
materials, and how they work for or against survey completion. This
paper contributes to these deliberations by exploring more-than-human
agency in the delivery and completion of a postal questionnaire,
distributed to rural households that are self-sufficient for water on
the south coast of New South Wales, Australia. By focusing on the
elements, infrastructure, and animals that work with and against survey
delivery and completion, we show that questionnaire surveys are a
more-than-human achievement. Consideration of the chewed and weathered
survey, and the more-than-human processes that influence its delivery
and completion, matters in challenging ``human-centred{''} notions of
field research. We argue that what we know about the world through a
survey is always a performative process, not only by considering how
research design aligns with politics and knowledge practices, but also
the more-than-human.

N2  - Automation offers a promising solution to improve competitiveness for
the labor-intensive furniture manufacturing sector in Malaysia. This
study evaluated the level of application of automation, the factors
driving it, and the readiness of the furniture manufacturers towards
Industry 4.0. A questionnaire-based survey was targeted to large and
medium-sized furniture manufacturers throughout Malaysia, with responses
from 312 manufacturers. The results revealed that the panel-based
furniture manufacturers were more responsive towards the adoption of
automated technologies than other types of furniture manufacturers. The
machining centers and finishing operations within the furniture
factories showed the highest application of automated technologies. The
factor analysis revealed that the drivers for the application of
automated technologies were the desire for higher production capacity,
cost involved, product characteristics, and government policy. This
study emphasized that in the cost-sensitive furniture manufacturing
industry, the economic benefits of applying automation outweigh any
other factor in the decision to explore such technologies. The study
also revealed that furniture manufacturers are not ready to adopt
Industry 4.0, and any efforts by the government to push for such
transformation will require the provision of incentives and other
tangible economic benefits.

N2  - A variety of social credit systems (SCSs) are being implemented in China
in order to steer the behavior of Chinese individuals, businesses,
social organizations, and government agencies. The government and
industry architects of these SCSs claim that such systems will
eventually lead to more honest and law-abiding behavior, thus improving
the quality of life among China's citizenry. However, very little is
known about citizens' experience with and responses to different types
of SCS initiatives. This article helps to address this gap. On the basis
of a cross-regional survey and interviews with SCS participants, we find
that a surprisingly high share of respondents changed their behavior at
least once, with changes concentrated in a few categories, including
changing shopping behavior and following traffic regulations. Citizens
who were part of a mandatory government-run SCS pilot report altered
their behavior in more ways than citizens who joined a commercial SCS.
Interestingly, behavioral responses are driven mainly by material or
symbolic (i.e., social recognition) motivations to influence scores in a
positive way, with punitive elements playing less of a role. Finally, we
find that SCSs currently reach only specific citizen groups due to
variable responsiveness to the incentives provided by commercial and
government-run SCSs.

N2  - This paper explores whether agricultural advisors employed by chemical
companies or agricultural companies selling pesticides
(supplier-affiliated advisors) are more likely to recommend more
intensive use of pesticides than advisors employed by companies without
an economic interest in selling pesticides (independent advisors). We
further test whether potential differences in advice are caused by
differences in advisors' perceived demands for advice from farmers,
different environmental risk perceptions about pesticide use or
different weighing of the purposes of pesticide use. The analysis is
based on a survey administered to the whole population of 540 advisors
in Denmark; we received 227 valid responses. The main finding is that
pesticide advice differs across company type. We find that
supplier-affiliated advisors are less likely to recommend lower doses -
scoring on average 3.9 on a scale from 1 (never) to 5 (always).
Independent advisors employed at Danish Agricultural Advisory Services
score an average of 4.3. The difference is statistically significant.
The analysis does not offer strong support for the different causal
mediators we examined. Advisors across company type tend to weigh
different objectives equally; tend to agree on environmental risk
perception of using pesticides; and differ only slightly on perceived
farmer demand. One possible conclusion, therefore, is that explanation
is as simply that differences in economic incentives produce different
recommendations between advisory companies. Policy implications of the
findings are that the European Union should consider addressing this
difference more directly when regulating the use of pesticides in
European agriculture through e.g. the Sustainable Use of Pesticides
Directive (Directive, 2009/128/EC). More differentiation in the
approaches for informing different types of advisors might be needed.
Moreover, our results point towards the need for knowledge about whether
advisors in other countries than Denmark tend to believe that approved
pesticides are innocuous to the environment because such perceptions
might hamper initiatives to reduce the doses of approved pesticides.

N2  - BackgroundPostal surveys are widely used in scientific studies,
including dietary surveys, but few studies about methods to increase
participation in national dietary surveys are published. In the present
study we compared response rates in a pilot study to a national dietary
survey among infants using two different incentives (gift certificate or
lottery), personalization in the form of handwritten name and address
vs. a printed label and mode of sending out invitations (e-mail or
postal invitation).MethodsIn this parallel-design pseudo-randomized
pilot trial, a nationally representative sample of 698 mothers of
infants aged 6 and 12months was drawn from the Norwegian National
Registry and invited to complete a food frequency questionnaire about
their infant's diet. One half of the mothers of 6month olds were
randomized by alternation to the lottery group (n=198) and offered to
participate in a lottery of two prizes (500 EUR and 1000 EUR). The other
half (n=200) was offered a gift certificate (50 EUR) upon completion of
the questionnaire. Each incentive group was randomized by alternation to
receiving an invitation with handwritten name and address or a printed
label. For the mothers of infants aged 12months (n=300), 150 mothers
received an e-mail invitation and 150 mothers received a postal
invitation. Logistic regression was used for testing differences between
the groups.ResultsThe response rate was significantly higher (p=0.028)
in the gift certificate group (72%) than in the lottery group (62%).
No difference was seen between those receiving an invitation with a
handwritten name and address (68%) compared to a printed label (66%,
p=0.72). A somewhat higher response rate was seen when using the postal
(50%) compared to the e-mail invitation (43%, p=0.25).ConclusionsIn
this pseudo-randomized parallel-design trial of women participating in a
national dietary survey among infants, the response rate was higher when
offered a gift certificate than when participating in a lottery.
Handwritten name and address did not affect participation compared to a
printed label. Only a moderate difference was seen between the postal
and e-mail invitation. Others conducting similar methodological studies
are encouraged to publish their results to expand the knowledge basis in

N2  - BackgroundMonetary incentive is often used to increase response rate in
smokers' survey, but such effect of prepaid and promised incentives in a
follow-up survey is unknown. We compared the effect of different
incentive schemes on the consent and retention rates in a follow-up
survey of adult cigarette smokers.MethodsThis was a randomized
controlled trial (RCT) in Hong Kong, China. Smokers who completed a
non-incentivized baseline telephone smoking survey were invited to a
3-month follow-up, with randomization into (1) the control group (no
incentive), (2) a promised HK$100 (US$12.8) incentive upon completion,
(3) a promised HK$200 (US$25.6) incentive upon completion, or (4) a
prepaid HK$100 incentive plus another promised HK$100 incentive (mixed
incentive). Crude risk ratios from log-binomial regression models were
used to assess if the 3 incentive schemes predicted higher rates of
consent at baseline or retention at 3-month than no incentive.ResultsIn
total, 1246 smokers were enrolled. The overall consent and retention
rates were 37.1 and 23.0%, respectively. Both rates generally increased
with the incentive amount and offer of prepaid incentive. The mixed
incentive scheme marginally increased the retention rate versus no
incentive (26.8% vs 20.3%; risk ratio (RR)=1.32; 95% CI: 1.00-1.76;
P=0.053), but not the consent rate (RR=1.13; 95% CI: 0.93-1.38;
P=0.22). Among the consented participants, approximately 50% in the
mixed incentive group received the mailed prepaid incentive, who
achieved a higher retention rate than the group without incentives
(82.8% vs 56.1%; RR=1.48; 95% CI: 1.21-1.80; P<0.01).ConclusionThe
mixed incentive scheme combining the prepaid and promised incentive was
effective to increase the follow-up retention rate by 48%. We recommend
this mixed incentive scheme to increase the follow-up retention rate.
More efficient methods of delivering the incentive are needed to
maximize its effects.Trial registrationU.S. Clinical Trials registry

N2  - Current primary care in Finland is based on the Primary Health Care Act
(1972), which addressed numerous new tasks to all municipalities. All of
them had to find a new health centre organization, which provides a wide
range of health services, including prevention and public health
promotion. Multiple tasks require multiprofessional staff, and thus, the
Finnish health centre personnel consisted not only of GPs but of public
health nurses, midwives, physiotherapists, psychologists, social
workers, dentists, etc. During the next decade, there have been some
changes but the idea of multiprofessional structure has remained.
According to the QUALICOPC study (2012) Finnish GPs are still co-located
with several other healthcare professionals compared to most of the
European countries; even compared to other Nordic countries which
otherwise have many similarities in their primary healthcare. During the
last 10 or 15 years, healthcare providers and researchers have
recognized a new challenge: our current systems do not meet the needs of
patients with multiple health and social problems-and the proportion of
these patients is increasing all the time as the population is getting
older. One could suppose that preconditions of handling multimorbidity
would be excellent in multiprofessional surroundings like ours, but
actually, a person with multiple problems is a challenge there, too.
Multiprofessional organization in primary care does not guarantee proper
care of patients with multiple diseases, if we do not acknowledge the
challenge and revise our systems. We have to develop new ways of
collaboration and new models of integrated care. The problematic part is
secondary care, which is organized with logic of one medical speciality
per visit. In Tampere University Hospital district, we have created a
care pathway model, which defines the roles of primary healthcare and
secondary care. Nationwide, we have recently started to prepare national
guidelines for the care of patients with multimorbidity. What we need
more in the future is more research on new practices and models.
Background: Most patients with antihypertensive medication do not
achieve their blood pressure (BP) target. Several barriers to successful
hypertension treatment are well identified but we need novel ways of
addressing them. Research question: Can using a checklist improve the
quality of care in the initiation of new antihypertensive medication?
Methods: This non-blinded, cluster-randomized, controlled study was
conducted in eight primary care study centres in central Finland,
randomized to function as either intervention (n = 4) or control sites
(n = 4). We included patients aged 30-75 years who were prescribed
antihypertensive medication for the first time. Initiation of medication
in the intervention group was carried out with a nine-item checklist,
filled in together by the treating physician and the patient. The
treating physician managed hypertension treatment in the control group
without a study-specific protocol. Results: In total, 119 patients were
included in the study, of which 118 were included in the analysis (n =
59 in the control group, n = 59 in the intervention group). When
initiating medication, an adequate BP target was set for 19% of the
patients in the control group and for 68% in the intervention group.
Shortly after the appointment, only 14% of the patients in the control
group were able to remember the adequate BP target, compared with 32%
in the intervention group. The use of the checklist was also related to
more regular agreement on the next follow-up appointment (64% in the
control group vs 95% in the intervention group). Conclusion: Even
highly motivated new hypertensive patients in Finnish primary care have
significant gaps in their treatment-related skills. The use of a
checklist for initiation of antihypertensive medication was related to
substantial improvement in these skills. Based on our findings, the use
of a checklist might be a practical tool for clinicians initiating new
antihypertensive medications.
Background: Immediate feedback is underused in the French medical
education curriculum, specifically with video-recorded consultation.
Research question: The objective of this study was to evaluate the
feasibility and the interest in this teaching method as a training and
assessment tool in the learning process of general practitioner (GP)
trainees. Methods: During the period November 2017 to October 2018,
trainees in ambulatory training courses collected quantitative data
about recording consultations with a video camera: numbers of
recordings, feedback, patients' participation refusals, and information
about the learning process and competencies. The trainees' level of
satisfaction was measured by means of a questionnaire at the end of
their traineeship. Results: Sixty-seven trainees were recruited and 44
of them 65.7% actively participated in the study; 607 video recordings
and 243 feedback with trainers were performed. Few patients (18.5%)
refused the video-recording. Most trainees considered video recording
with immediate feedback to be a relevant learning tool. It made it
possible for the participants to observe their difficulties and their
achievements. `Relation, communication, patient-centred care' was the
most built competency, non-verbal communication, in particular. Time was
the main limiting factor of this teaching method. Most trainees were in
favour of its generalization in their university course. Conclusion:
Video recording with immediate feedback in real-time consultation needs
to be adapted to training areas and depends on time and logistics. This
teaching method seems to be useful in the development of communication
skills. It could lift the barriers of the trainer's physical presence
near GP trainees during immediate feedback in real-time consultation. It
could help trainees to build their competencies while enhancing the
place of immediate feedback in the general practice curriculum. It could
also constitute an additional tool for the certification of GP trainees.
Background: Perinatal depression has been associated with psychiatric
morbidity in mothers and their offspring. This study assessed the
prevalence of perinatal depressive symptoms in a large population of
women and investigated associations of these symptoms with demographic
and clinical factors. Research question: Which factors (including
sociodemographic, medical, lifestyle, and laboratory test) are
associated with perinatal depression? Methods: All members of Maccabi
Health Services who completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale
(EPDS) during 2015-2016 were included in the study. Odds ratios (ORs)
were calculated for associations of sociodemographic, medical,
lifestyle, and laboratory test factors with perinatal depressive
symptoms, according to a score >10 on the EPDS. Results: Of 27 912 women
who filled the EPDS, 2029 (7.3%) were classified as having peripartum
depression. In a logistic regression analysis, the use of antidepressant
medications, particularly for a period greater than three months, Arab
background, current or past smoking, a diagnosis of chronic diabetes and
age under 25 years were all associated with increased ORs for perinatal
depression; while Orthodox Jewish affiliation, residence in the
periphery and higher haemoglobin level were associated with lower ORs.
Incidences of depression were 17.4% in women with a history of
antidepressant medication, 16% among women with diabetes, and 11.8%
among current smokers. Conclusion: Several demographic, medical, and
lifetime factors were found to be substantially more prevalent among
women with symptoms of perinatal depression than those without.
Encouraging women to complete the EPDS during and following pregnancy
may help identify women in need of support.
Background: Regulating the quality and effectiveness of the work of
general practitioners is essential for a sound healthcare system. In the
Republic of Macedonia this is regulated by the Health Insurance Fund
through a system of penalties/sanctions. Research question: The goal of
this study is to evaluate the types and effectiveness of the sanctions
used on primary care practitioners. Methods: This is a quantitative
research study for which we used an anonymous survey with 18 questions.
This survey was distributed to 443 randomly selected general
practitioners from different parts of Macedonia and 438 of them
responded. For the quantitative data, we used the Pearson's chi-squared
test, correlation and descriptive statistics. Part of the survey is
qualitative, consisting of comments and opinions of the general
practitioners. Results: From the participants, 336 were female and 102
were male. The doctors' gender was not associated with sanctioning. Most
general practitioners were in the age categories of 30-39 and 40-49
years. The participants' age had a significant influence on
sanctioning-older doctors were sanctioned more frequently. Out of 438
participants, 33.3% were specialists in family medicine and 66.7%
general practitioners. Specialists in family medicine were sanctioned
significantly more frequently than general practitioners. Doctors that
worked in the hospital or 19 km from the nearest hospital were
significantly more frequently sanctioned. The three most common reasons
for sanctions were financial consumption of prescriptions and referrals
above the agreed amount, higher rate of sick leaves and/or justification
of sick leaves and unrealized preventative goals or education.
`Financial sanction by scale' was the most common type of sanction:
49.8% of participants. Doctors who followed the guidelines, but who
were exposed to violence were sanctioned significantly more frequently.
Conclusion: We can observe that age, speciality, the distance of the
workplace from the nearest hospital and violence influence sanctioning.
Background: Biases are major barriers to external validity of studies,
reducing evidence. Among these biases, the definition and the reality of
the Hawthorne effect (HE) (or observation bias) remains controversial.
According to McCambridge in a review from 2013, the Hawthorne effect is
a behaviour change occurring when the subject is being observed during a
scientific study. This effect would be multifactorial, and he suggests
the term `effects of research participation.' However, the reviewed
studies were conflicting and evidence is sparse. Research question: We
updated McCambridge's review to actualize the definition of the HE.
Methods: McCambridge's most recent article dated back to January 3,
2012. We focused on the articles published between January 1, 2012 and
August 10, 2018 searching Medline. We used the sole keyword `Hawthorne
Effect.' The search was filtered based on the dates, the availability of
an abstract and the languages English and French. We included articles
defining or evaluating the HE. Articles citing the effect without
defining it or irrelevant to the topic were excluded. Two independent
readers searched and analysed the articles. Discrepancies were solved by
consensus. Results: Out of 106 articles, 42 articles were included. All
the articles acknowledged an observation bias, considered as significant
or not, depending on the population (education, literacy), the methods
and the variable of interest. It was a psychological change, limited in
time. The HE was defined as a change of behaviour related to direct or
indirect observation of the subjects or the investigators, to their
previous selection and commitment in the study (written agreement) and
to social desirability. Despite observations, articles were conflicting.
Some do confirm the existence of the HE, others deny it. Meta-analysis
is ongoing. Conclusion: No formal consensus regarding the definition of
the effect has been reached so far. However, the authors agree on its
implication as an experimental artefact.
Background: Polypharmacy and multimorbidity are on the rise.
Consequently, general practitioners (GPs) treat an increasing number of
multimorbid patients with polypharmacy. To limit negative health
outcomes, GPs should search for inappropriate medication intake in such
patients. However, systematic medication reviews are time-consuming.
Recent eHealth tools, such as the `systematic tool to reduce
inappropriate prescribing' (STRIP) assistant, provide an opportunity for
GPs to get support when conducting such medication reviews. Research
question: Can the STRIP assistant as electronic decision support help
GPs to optimize medication appropriateness in older, multimorbid
patients with polypharmacy? Methods: This cluster randomized controlled
trial is conducted in 40 Swiss GP practices, each recruiting 8-10
patients aged >= 65 years, with >= 3 chronic conditions and >= 5 chronic
medications (320 patients in total). We compare the effectiveness of
using the STRIP assistant for optimizing medication appropriateness to
usual care. The STRIP assistant is based on the STOPP/START criteria
(version 2) and, for this trial, it is implemented in the Swiss eHealth
setting where some GPs already share routine medical data from their
electronic medical records in a research database (FIRE). Patients are
followed-up for 12 months and the change in medication appropriateness
is the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes are the numbers of falls and
fractures, quality of life, health economic parameters, patients'
willingness to deprescribe as well as implementation barriers and
enablers for GPs when using the STRIP assistant. Results: Patient
recruitment started in December 2018. This presentation focuses on the
study protocol and the challenges faced when testing this new software
in Swiss primary care. Conclusion: Finding out whether the STRIP
assistant is an effective tool and beneficial for older and multimorbid
patients, who are usually excluded from trials, will have an impact on
the coordination of chronic care for multimorbid patients in Swiss
primary care in this new eHealth environment.
Background: Workplace violence (WPV) towards healthcare staff is
becoming a common problem in different healthcare settings worldwide.
Moreover, the prevalence is 16 times higher than in other professions.
How often it happened towards young doctors working as general
practitioners (GPs) at the beginning of their careers has been rarely
studied. Research question: To investigate the frequency and forms of
WPV, experienced by the young Croatian GPs from their patients, and
violence reporting pattern to the competent institutions. Methods: The
cross-sectional study was carried out on 74 GP residents, during their
postgraduate study in family medicine in May 2018. A specially designed
anonymous questionnaire, developed by Association of Family Physicians
of South Eastern Europe, was used to investigate the prevalence and
forms of WPV, the narrative description of the traumatic event itself
and the process of reporting it. Results: The response rate was 91.9%,
female 87%, the median of years working as a GP was 3.5 years. Most of
the residents were working in an urban practice (63%), others in the
rural and the suburban once (27%, 10%). All GP residents experienced
patients' and caregivers' violent behaviour directed towards them.
High-intensity violence (e.g. physical violence, sexual harassment) was
experienced by 44%, middle intensity (e.g. intimidation, visual sexual
harassment) by 84% while all residents experienced verbal violence.
Only 13.2% residents reported WPV to the competent institutions. Most
of GP residents reported the appearance of the new form of violence: the
one over the internet. Conclusion: The high prevalence of all types of
violence towards young Croatian doctors is worrisome, as is the fact
that violent acts are seldom reported to the competent institutions.
Those alarming facts could become a threat to GPs career choosing.
Background: About 50% of patients adhere to chronic therapy in France.
Improving adherence should improve their care. Identifying the patient's
difficulties in taking medication is complex for the physician, because
there is no gold standard for measuring adherence to medications. How
can the general practitioner in his/her practice identify patient
compliance? Research question: Analyse studies that develop or validate
scales used to estimate adherence in primary care. Methods: A systematic
review of the literature from PubMed, the Cochrane Library and PsycINFO
databases. The search terms used were the MeSH terms (or adapted to the
database's vocabulary): questionnaire, compliance and primary care. All
articles were retained whatever the language of writing. Selection
criteria were: assessment of the development, validation or reliability
of one or more compliance scales; taking place in primary care. One
reviewer screened titles, which included the term adherence then
abstracts and full text. Only articles evaluating the development,
validity or reliability of a primary care adherence rating scale were
included in analysis. Results: In total 1022 articles were selected and
18 articles were included. Seventeen adherence scales were identified in
primary care, most of which targeted a single pathology, especially
hypertension. The most cited scale is the MMAS Morisky medication
adherence scale. Three scales were developed for patients with multiple
chronic diseases. One scale was developed for patients older than 65
years-the Strathclyde compliance risk assessment tool (SCRAT)-and two
scales were developed for adult patients whatever their age-the
instrument developed by Sidorkiewicz et al., and the DAMS, diagnostic
adherence to medication scale. Conclusion: Two scales have been
developed and validated in primary care to assess patient adherence with
multiple chronic diseases: the DAMS and the instrument developed by
Sidorkiewicz et al. A simple, reliable, reproducible primary care scale
would assess the impact of actions developed to improve adherence:
motivational interviewing, patient therapeutic education, and the ASALeE
protocol.
Background: Multimorbidity prevalence increases with age while declining
quality of life (QoL) is one of its major consequences. Research
question: The study aims to: (1) Assess the relationship between
increasing number of diseases and QoL. (2) Identify the most frequently
occurring patterns of diseases and how they relate to QoL. (3) Observe
how these associations differ across different European countries and
regions. Methods: Cross-sectional data analysis performed on wave six of
the population-based survey of health, ageing and retirement in Europe
(SHARE) (n = 68 231). Data were collected in 2015 among population 50+
years old in 17 European countries and Israel. Multimorbidity is defined
as the co-occurrence of two or more chronic conditions. Conditions were
self-declared and identified through an open-end questionnaire
containing 17 prelisted conditions plus conditions added by
participants. Control, autonomy, self-realization and pleasure
questionnaire (CASP-12v) was used to evaluate QoL. Association between
increasing number of diseases and QoL was assessed with linear
regression. Factor analysis is being conducted to identify patterns of
diseases to evaluate their impact on QoL further. Multilevel analysis
will take into account differences between countries and regions.
Confounding was searched with directed acyclic graph (DAG) method and
included age, sex, education, socio-economic status, behavioural habits,
social support and healthcare parameters. Results: Participants
(49.09%) had two or more diseases. Maximum number of diseases per
person was 13, mean number was 1.9. Unadjusted preliminary analysis
showed that on average QoL decreases by -1.27 (95%CI: -1.29, -1.24)
with each added new condition across Europe. The decline appears to be
the steepest in Spain, -1.61 (95%CI: -1.71, -1.51), and the least so in
Israel, -0.67 (95%CI: -0.82, -0.52). Conclusion: Ongoing analysis will
identify disease patterns, which may have the highest impact on QoL, as
well as to elucidate the role of confounders in the relationship between
increasing number of diseases and disease patterns with QoL.
Background: The burden and preventive potential of disease is typically
estimated for each non-communicable disease (NCD) separately but NCDs
often co-occur, which hampers reliable quantification of their overall
burden and joint preventive potential in the population. Research
questions: What is the lifetime risk of developing any NCD? Which
multimorbidity clusters of NCDs cause the greatest burden? To what
extent do three key shared risk factors, namely smoking, hypertension
and being overweight, influence this risk, life-expectancy and
NCD-multimorbidity? Methods: Between 1990 and 2012 we followed NCD-free
participants aged >= 45 years at baseline from the Dutch prospective
Rotterdam study for incidents of stroke, heart disease, diabetes,
chronic respiratory disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative disease. We
quantified (co-)occurrence and remaining lifetime risk of NCDs in a
competing risk framework, and studied the effects of smoking,
hypertension, and being overweight on lifetime risk and life expectancy.
Results: During follow-up of 9061 participants, 814 participants were
diagnosed with stroke, 1571 with heart disease, 625 with diabetes, 1004
with chronic respiratory disease, 1538 with cancer, and 1065 with
neurodegenerative disease. Among those, 1563 participants (33.7%) were
diagnosed with multiple diseases. The lifetime risk of any NCD from the
age of 45 onwards was 94.0% (95%CI: 92.9-95.1) for men and 92.8%
(95%CI: 91.8-93.8) for women. Absence of shared risk factors was
associated with a 9.0-year delay (95%CI: 6.3-11.6) in the age at onset
of any NCD. Furthermore, overall life expectancy for participants
without risk factors was 6.0 years (95%CI: 5.7-7.9) longer than those
with these risk factors. Participants without these risk factors spent
21.6% of their remaining lifetime with NCDs, compared to 31.8% for
those with risk factors. Conclusion: Nine out of 10 individuals aged 45
years and older will develop at least one NCD during their remaining
lifetime. A third was diagnosed with multiple NCDs during follow-up.
Absence of three common shared risk factors related to compression of
morbidity of NCDs.
Background: This study examined if using electronic reminders increases
the rate of diagnosis recordings in the patient chart system following
visits to a general practitioner (GP). The impact of electronic
reminders was studied in the primary care of a Finnish city. Research
question: How effective is the reminder of the information system in
improving the diagnostic level of primary care? Which is better and how:
financial incentives or reminders? Methods: This was an observational
retrospective study based on a before-and-after design and was carried
out by installing an electronic reminder in the computerized patient
chart system to improve the recording of diagnoses during GP visits. The
quality of the recorded diagnoses was observed before and after the
intervention. The effect of this intervention on the recording of
diagnoses was also studied. Results: Before intervention, the level of
recording diagnoses was about 40% in the primary care units. After four
years, the recording rate had risen to 90% (p < 0.001). The rate of
change in the recording of diagnoses was highest during the first year
of intervention. In the present study, most of the visits concerned mild
respiratory infections, elevated blood pressure, low back pain and type
II diabetes. Conclusion: An electronic reminder improved the recording
of diagnoses during the visits to GPs. The present intervention produced
data, which reflects the distribution of diagnoses in real clinical life
in primary care and thus provides valid data about the public.
Background: Child abuse is widespread, occurs in all cultures and
communities and remains undiscovered in 90% of the cases. In total,
80% of reported child abuse concerns emotional ill-treatment. In the
Netherlands, at least 3% (118 000) of children are victims of child
abuse resulting in 50 deaths each year. Only 1-3% of abuse cases are
reported by general practitioners (GPs) to the Child Protective Services
agency (CPS). To explain this low reporting rate, we examined GPs'
experiences with child abuse. Research question: How does the suspicion
of child abuse arise in GPs' diagnostic reasoning? How do they act upon
their suspicion and what kind of barriers do they experience in their
management? Methods: In total 26 GPs (16 female) participated in four
focus groups. We used purposive sampling to include GPs with different
levels of experience in rural and urban areas spread over the
Netherlands. We used NVivo for thematic content analysis. Results:
Suspected child abuse arose based on common triggers and a gut feeling
that `something is wrong here'. GPs acted upon their suspicion by
gathering more data by history taking and physical examination. They
often found it challenging to decide whether a child was abused because
parents, despite their good intentions, may lack parenting skills and
differ in their norms and values. GPs reported clear signs of sexual
abuse and physical violence to CPS. However, in less clear-cut cases
they followed-up and built a supporting network around the family. Most
GPs highly valued the patient-doctor relationship while recognizing the
risk of pushing boundaries. Conclusion: A low child abuse reporting rate
by GPs to CPS does not mean a low detection rate. GPs use patients'
trust in their doctor to improve a child's situation by involving other
professionals.
Background: The number of people suffering from multiple chronic
conditions, multimorbidity, is rising. For society, multimorbidity is
known to increase healthcare expenses through more frequent contacts,
especially with the primary sector. For the individual, an increasing
number of medical conditions are associated with lower quality of life
(QoL). However, there is no statistically validated condition-specific
patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) for the assessment of QoL among
patients with multimorbidity. A validated PROM is essential in order to
measure effect in intervention studies for this patient group. Research
question: (1) To identify items covering QoL among patients with
multimorbidity in a Danish context. (2) To develop and validate a PROM
for assessment of QoL among patients with multimorbidity. (3) To utilize
the final PROM in a large group of patients with multimorbidity to
measure their QoL when living with different combinations and severity
of multimorbidity. Methods: Phase 1: qualitative individual and focus
group interviews with patients with multimorbidity to identify relevant
QoL items. Phase 2: validation of the items through a draft
questionnaire sent by email to around 200-400 patients with
multimorbidity. Phase 3: psychometric validation of the draft
questionnaire securing items with the highest possible measurement
quality. Phase 4: assessment of QoL among approximately 2000 patients
with multimorbidity from the Danish Lolland-Falster study. Results:
There are no results yet. Currently, the interview guide is under
development. Conclusion: Despite the rising number of patients with
multimorbidity and the known inverse relationship between a patient's
number of medical conditions and their quality of life, there is no
statistically validated condition-specific PROM for assessment of QoL
among this group. Our aim is that this project's developed and validated
PROM will be used in future intervention studies as a valid measure of
QoL among patients with multimorbidity.
Background: Through a systematic review of the literature and
qualitative research across Europe, the European General Practitioners
Research Network (EGPRN) has designed and validated a comprehensive
definition of multimorbidity. It is a concept considering all the
biopsychosocial conditions of a patient. This concept encompasses more
than 50 variables and is consequently difficult to use in primary care.
Consideration of adverse outcomes (such as death or acute
hospitalization) could help to distinguish which variables could be risk
factors of decompensation within the definition of multimorbidity.
Research question: Which criteria in the EGPRN concept of multimorbidity
could detect outpatients at risk of death or acute hospitalization (i.e.
decompensation) in a primary care cohort at 24-months of follow-up?
Methods: Primary care outpatients (131) answering to EGPRN's
multimorbidity definition were included by GPs, during two periods of
inclusion in 2014 and 2015. At 24 months follow-up, the status
`decompensation' or `nothing to report' was collected. A logistic
regression following a Cox model was performed to achieve the survival
analysis and to identify potential risk factors. Results: At 24 months
follow-up, 120 patients were analysed. Three different clusters were
identified. Forty-four patients, representing 36.6% of the population,
had either died or been hospitalized more than seven consecutive days.
Two variables were significantly associated with decompensation: Number
of GPs encounters per year (HR: 1.06; 95%CI: 1.03-1.10, p <0.001), and
total number of diseases (HR: 1.12; 95%CI: 1.03-1.33; P = 0.039).
Conclusion: To prevent death or acute hospitalization in multimorbid
outpatients, GPs may be alert to those with high rates of GP encounters
or a high number of illnesses. These results are consistent with others
in medical literature.
Background: A study of casual versus causal comorbidity in family
medicine in three practice populations from the Netherlands, Malta and
Serbia. Research question: (1) What is the observed comorbidity of the
20 most common episodes of care in three countries? (2) How much of the
observed comorbidity is likely to be casual versus causal? Methods:
Participating family doctors (FDs) in the Netherlands, Malta and Serbia
recorded details of all patient contacts in an episode of care structure
using electronic medical records based on the International
Classification of Primary Care, collecting data on all elements of the
doctor-patient encounter, including the diagnostic labels (episode of
care labels, EoCs). Comorbidity was measured using the odds ratio of
both conditions being incident or rest-prevalent in the same patient in
one-year data frames, as against not. Results: Comorbidity in family
practice expressed as odds ratios between the 41 most prevalent (joint
top 20) episode titles in the three populations. Specific associations
were explored in different age groups to observe the changes in odds
ratios with increasing age as a surrogate for a temporal or biological
gradient. Conclusion: After applying accepted criteria for testing the
causality of associations, it is reasonable to conclude that most of the
observed primary care comorbidity is casual. It would be incorrect to
assume causal relationships between co-occurring diseases in family
medicine, even if such a relationship might be plausible or consistent
with current conceptualizations of the causation of disease. Most
observed comorbidity in primary care is the result of increasing illness
diversity.
Background: The concept of therapeutic alliance emerged in the beginning
of the twentieth century and came from psychoanalysis. This notion was
then extended to the somatic field and aims to replace the paternalistic
model in the doctor-patient relationship. The EGPRN TATA group selected
the WAI SR as the most reliable and reproducible scale to assess
therapeutic alliance. To use it within Europe, it was necessary to
translate it into most European languages. The following study aimed to
assess the linguistic homogeneity of five of these translations.
Research question: Are the translations of the WAI SR homogeneous
between Spain, Poland, Slovenia, France and Italy? Methods:
Forward-backward translations were achieved in five participating
countries (Spain, Poland, France, Slovenia and Italy). Using a Delphi
procedure, a global homogeneity check was then performed by comparing
the five backward translations during a physical meeting involving GP
teachers/researchers from many European countries; the heterogeneity of
the participants' origins was a token of reliability. Results: In the
assessment of the five translations, 107 experts participated. A
consensus was obtained in one to two Delphi rounds for each. During the
`homogeneity check,' some discrepancies were noted with the original
version and were discussed with the local teams. This last stage
permitted to highlight cultural discrepancies and real translation
issues and to correct if needed. Conclusion: Five homogeneous versions
of the WAI SR are now available in five European languages. They will be
helpful to evaluate therapeutic alliance at different levels: for GPs in
daily practice, for students during the initial and continuous training,
and for further research in these five countries.
Background: The patient enablement instrument (PEI) is an established
patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) that reflects the quality of a
GP appointment. It is a six-item questionnaire, addressed to the patient
immediately after a consultation. Research question: The study aimed to
evaluate whether a single-item measure (the Q1), based on the PEI, or a
single question extracted from the PEI itself (the Q2) could replace the
PEI when measuring patient enablement among Finnish healthcare centre
patients. Methods: The study design included (1) a pilot study with
brief interviews with the respondents, (2) a questionnaire study before
and after a single appointment with a GP, and (3) a telephone interview
two weeks after the appointment. The correlations between the measures
were examined. The sensitivity, specificity and both positive and
negative predictive values for the Q1 and the Q2 were calculated, with
different PEI score cut-off points. Results: Altogether 483 patients
with completed PEIs were included in the analyses. The correlations
between the PEI and the Q1 or the Q2 were 0.48 and 0.84, respectively.
Both the Q1 and the Q2 had high sensitivity and negative predictive
value in relation to patients with lower enablement scores. The
reliability coefficients were 0.24 for the Q1 and 0.76 for the Q2.
Conclusion: The Q2 seems to be a valid and reliable way to measure
patient enablement. The Q1 seems to be less correlated with the PEI, but
it also has high negative predictive value in relation to low enablement
scores.
Multimorbidity challenges existing healthcare organization and research,
which remains disease and single-condition focused. Basic science
approaches to multimorbidity have the potential to identify important
shared mechanisms by which diseases we currently think of as distinct
might arise, but there is a pressing need for more applied and health
services research to understand better and manage multimorbidity now.
There are several recent clinical guidelines, which make recommendations
for managing multimorbidity or related issues for patients such as
polypharmacy and frailty. However, the evidence base underpinning these
recommendations is often weak, and these guidelines, therefore, also
help define a research agenda. A key problem for researchers and health
services is that multimorbidity is very heterogeneous, in that
`intermittent low back pain plus mild eczema' presents very different
challenges to researchers and health services compared to `active
psychosis plus severe heart failure'. Identifying important but
tractable research questions is therefore not always straightforward.
This presentation will identify important gaps in the evidence, and
illustrate how they might be filled. The focus will be on two areas
where there is consensus that better evidence is needed to inform care
design and delivery: (1) organizational interventions to implement more
coordinated and holistic care; and (2) interventions to improve
medicines management in people with multimorbidity and polypharmacy.
These illustrate both the potential for imaginative research, but also
the scale.
Background: The accumulation of multiple chronic diseases
(multimorbidity) and multiple prescribed medications (polypharmacy) over
time may influence the extent to which an individual maintains health
and well-being in later life. Research question: This research aims to
describe the patterns (sequence and timing) of multimorbidity and
polypharmacy that accumulate over time among primary healthcare patients
in Canada. Methods: Data are derived from the Canadian primary care
sentinel surveillance network (CPCSSN) electronic medical record (EMR)
database that holds >= 1 million longitudinal, de-identified records.
Multimorbidity will be identified with 20 categories, cut-off points of
>= 2 and >= 3 chronic conditions and the International Classification of
Disease (ICD) classification system. Polypharmacy will be identified
using the cut-off points of >= 5 and >= 10 medication classes and the
Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system. Analyses
will be conducted using Java and Stata 14.2 software. Results: The
prevalence of chronic diseases and prescribed medications will be
presented, as well as the patterns that are observed among adults and
older adults in Canada. The most frequent patterns (combinations and
permutations) of multimorbidity and polypharmacy will be presented,
stratified by sex and age category. The relationships with other
factors, such as the presence of frailty, disability or increased health
service use, will be examined. As well, the methodological challenges to
identifying the presence and sequence of multimorbidity and polypharmacy
in national, longitudinal data will be discussed. Conclusion: This
research will explore the profiles of multimorbidity and polypharmacy in
mid- and late-life using a national, longitudinal database. These
findings can be used strategically to inform healthcare delivery and to
contribute to the understanding of multimorbidity and polypharmacy in
the international literature. Reducing the burden of prescribed
medications and the harms of polypharmacy are key tasks within the
context of multimorbidity.
Background: Multimorbidity and polypharmacy have become the norm for
general practitioners (GPs). Ideally, GPs search for inappropriate
medication and, if necessary, deprescribe. However, it remains
challenging to deprescribe given time constraints and little backup from
guidelines. Furthermore, barriers and enablers to deprescribing among
patients have to be accounted for. Research question: To identify
barriers and enablers to deprescribing in older patients with
polypharmacy. Methods: We surveyed among patients >70 years with
multimorbidity (>2 chronic conditions) and polypharmacy (>4 regular
medicines). We invited Swiss GPs to recruit eligible patients, each of
whom completed a paper-based survey on demography, medications and
chronic conditions. We applied the revised patients' attitudes towards
deprescribing (rPATD) questionnaire and added 12 additional questions
and two open questions to assess barriers and enablers towards
deprescribing. Results: We analysed the first 221 responses received so
far and full results will be presented at the conference. Participants
were 79.3 years in mean (SD 5.8) and 48% female. Thirty-one percent
lived alone, and 85% prepared their medication themselves, all others
required help. Seventy-six percent of participants took 5-9 regular
medicines and 24% took >= 10 up to 22 medicines. Participants (76%)
were willing to deprescribe one or more of their medicines and 78% did
not have any negative experience with deprescribing. Age and gender were
not associated with their willingness to deprescribe. Important barriers
to deprescribing were satisfaction with drugs (96%), long-term drugs
(56%) and noticing positive effects when taking them (92%). When it
comes to deprescribing, 89% of participants wanted as much information
as possible on their medicines. Having a good relationship with their GP
was a further key factor to them (85%). Conclusion: Most older adults
are willing to deprescribe. They would like to be informed about their
medicines and want to discuss deprescribing to achieve shared
decision-making with the GP they trust.
Background: With growing populations of patients with multimorbidity,
general practitioners need insight into which patients in their practice
are most in need for person-centred integrated care ('high-need'
patients). Using data from electronic primary care medical records to
automatically create a list of possible `high need' patients could be a
quick and easy first step to assist GPs in identifying these patients.
Research question: Can `high need' patients with multimorbidity be
identified automatically from their primary care medical records?
Methods: Pseudonymized medical records of patients with multimorbidity
(>= 2 chronic diseases) were analysed. Data was derived from the Nivel
primary care database, a large registry containing data routinely
recorded in electronic health records. This includes data on healthcare
use, health problems and treatment. Logistic regression analysis was
conducted to predict outcomes (frequent contact with the general
practice, ER visits and unplanned hospital admissions). Predictors were
age, sex, healthcare use in the previous year, morbidity and medication
use. Results: In total, 245 065 patients with multimorbidity were
identified, of which 48% were above the age of 65 and 57% female. More
than 42% had five GP contacts in the previous year and 62% used five
or more different medications. Frequent contact with the general
practice could be reliably predicted using only the number of contacts
in the previous year (AUC: 0.82). Adding all other predictors (including
specific chronic conditions) only improved the predictive value of the
model marginally (AUC: 0.84). Identifying patients with a high risk for
ER visits and unplanned hospital admissions proved more difficult (AUC:
0.67 and 0.70, respectively). Conclusion: `High need' patients with
multimorbidity can be automatically selected from primary care medical
records using only the number of contacts with the general practice in
the previous year. Composing a list of these patients can help GPs to
identify those eligible for person-centred integrated care.
Background: Chronic diseases usually have a long duration and slow
progression and, as a result, they tend to aggregate in multimorbidity
patterns (MPs) during the life course and/or due to shared underlying
pathophysiological pathways. Knowledge of how MPs progress over time is
necessary to develop effective prevention management strategies.
Research question: What are the most likely MPs over time? Which
longitudinal shifts from one pattern to another occur during follow-up?
Methods: A prospective longitudinal study based on electronic health
records was conducted during 2012-2016 in Catalonia, Spain. For people
aged >= 65 years, we extracted data on demographics and diagnostic codes
for chronic diseases (ICD-10). Machine-learning techniques were applied
for the identification of disease clusters using fuzzy c-means analysis
to obtain initial clusters. To estimate longitudinal MPs and their
progression for each individual a hidden Markov model was fitted,
estimating: (1) the transition probability matrix between clusters; (2)
the initial cluster probability; (3) the most likely trajectory for each
individual. The prevalence of disease in each cluster, observed/expected
ratios (O/E ratios) and disease exclusivity was determined for each MP.
Criteria used to designate cluster: O/E ratio >= 2. Results: In total,
916 619 individuals were included. Ten MPs were identified. The cluster
including the most prevalent diseases was designated non-specific
(42.0% of individuals). The remaining nine clusters included the
following anatomical systems: ophthalmologic and mental diseases
(19.3%), osteometabolic (7.9%), cardio-circulatory (6.6%), and
others. Most patients, minimum 59.2%, remained in the same cluster
during the study period. The highest transitions to the mortality state
were observed in the cardio-circulatory (37.1%) and nervous (31.8%)
MPs. Conclusion: Ten significant longitudinal MPs were found. The
application of sophisticated statistical techniques ideally suited the
study of the MPs and allowed for characterization over time. This method
is useful to establish a probabilistic evolution of MPs.
Background: Quality of life is an essential theme for quantitative
surveys in primary care. Treatments and procedures need to be assessed
on whether they change patients' quality of life. This has led to the
creation of evaluation scales. The purpose of this study was to
determine reproducibility and efficiency of 11 previously selected
quality of life scales (selected with a systematic review) for the
general population. Research question: What is the best possible
reproducible and efficient quality of life scale for the general
population? Methods: The search was conducted from November 2017 to
April 2018 in PubMed and Cochrane databases, according to the PRISMA
(preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses)
protocol. The inclusion criteria were the psychometric qualities for
each of the 11 scales studied. Articles dealing with subpopulations or
those not written in IMRAD format were excluded. The collected values
were reproducibility and efficiency. Results: Out of 206, 46 selected
articles were included. Cronbach's alpha by domain and Pearson's
coefficient were the most analysed psychometrics. No valid efficiency
data was obtained. The internal consistency was over 0.7 for the SF-36,
SF12v2 and EQ-5D scales. The Pearson coefficient was over 0.4 for the
SF36v2, SF-12 and SF-12v2 scales. The Cohen's kappa ranged from 0.4 to
0.80 for the EQ-5D questionnaire. Conclusion: No scale is fully
validated. Reproducibility values were incomplete (Cronbach's alpha and
Pearson's most expressed). No efficiency data was found. The most
validated scales are the SF family and the EQ-5D. Researchers and
clinicians should be aware of these limitations when choosing a quality
of life scale. They should return to the scales' designs to choose the
one that underlines the type of quality of life they want to assess as
no external validity is available.
Background: Previous studies have shown an increased rate of infection
among patients with diabetes; however, it is unclear from these studies
if the level of HbA1c is correlated with infection. Research question:
This study aimed to examine the association between glycaemic control of
type 2 diabetes patients and the incidence of infections. Methods: An
HMO database was used to identify all DM patients. The first HbA1c test
during the period of the study was selected for each patient; then an
infection diagnosis was searched in the 60 days that followed the test.
We compared the HbA1c test results that were followed by an infection to
those that were not. After applying exclusion criteria: having cancer,
receiving immunosuppressive medication, undergoing dialysis treatment,
anaemia less than 9 mg%, and G6PD deficiency, there remained 33 637
patients in the cohort. The study period was October 2014 to September
2017. The following information was collected: age, gender,
socio-economic index, BMI, use of hypoglycaemic and steroid medication
in the 90 days before infection, and comorbid conditions (IHD, PVD, CVA,
CCF, asthma, COPD, Parkinson's disease, dementia, CRF). Results: In
total, 804 patients had an infection within 60 days following an HbA1c
test. For cellulitis, cholecystitis, herpes zoster, pneumonia and
sinusitis the HbA1c was higher than those patients that had no infection
(for cellulitis 7.603 vs 7.243). When factored into logistic regression
analysis, we found that other chronic diseases increased the risk of
infection between 29 and 60%. Each increase of a gram of HbA1c
increased the risk by 8.5%. Use of steroids in the 90 days before the
infection increases the chance of infection by 734%. Conclusion:
Increasing HbA1c and comorbidity both increase the risk of infection
among type 2 diabetics but use of oral or injectable steroids is a much
more significant risk factor.

N2  - Objective To examine the impact of policy incentives on patient's choice
of health-care providers for primary care and to capture the preferences
for general practitioner (GP) care. Study design Discrete choice
experiment. Methods A random sample of 704 adults and of 181 diabetics
were independently surveyed to elicit patients' preferences for common
disease diagnosis and diabetes care. Mixed logit regression was used for
the analysis. Results On average, the most valued attribute in GP care
are the organizational factors related to whether the provider has
sufficient medicine and equipment to provide capable primary care
service. Policy incentives, such as reducing waiting time, providing
prior expert access, and increasing Medicare reimbursement, can
facilitate the utilization of the GP system. Significant preference
heterogeneity was identified; specifically, patient preferences
significantly differ with regard to demand for common disease diagnosis
and diabetes care. Conclusion The identification of the preferences of
specific groups in regard to GP care is an organizational and political
imperative. Policy incentives are useful tools to guide patients' health
care seeking behavior. To change the perceptions of Chinese patients
with regard to health care, policy makers should consider the
heterogeneous responses of residents to policy incentives and focus
their efforts on key cohorts.

N2  - Objective: To assess the availability and price of naloxone as well as
pharmacy staff knowledge of the standing order for naloxone in
Pennsylvania pharmacies.
Methods: We conducted a telephone audit study from December 2016 to
April 2017 in which staff from Pennsylvania pharmacies were surveyed to
evaluate naloxone availability, staff understanding of the naloxone
standing order, and out-of-pocket cost of naloxone.
Results: Responses were obtained from 682 of 758 contacted pharmacies
(90% response rate). Naloxone was stocked (ie, available for
dispensing) in 306 (45%) pharmacies surveyed. Of the 376 (55%)
pharmacies that did not stock naloxone, 118 (31%) stated that they
could place an order for naloxone for pickup within 1 business day.
Responses by pharmacy staff to questions about key components of the
standing order for naloxone were collected from 581 of the 682
pharmacies who participated in the survey (85%). Of the 581 pharmacy
staff members who stated that they either stocked or could order
naloxone, 64% correctly answered all questions pertaining to
understanding of the naloxone standing order. The respective median
out-of-pocket prices stated in the audit varied by formulation and
ranged from $50 to $4000. Staff from national pharmacies were
significantly more likely than staff from regional/local chain and
non-chain pharmacies to correctly answer that a prescription was not
required to obtain naloxone (68.5%, 57.7%, and 52.4% respectively, (P
= 0.0045).
Conclusions: Multiple barriers to naloxone access exist in pharmacies
across a large, diverse state, despite the presence of a standing order
to facilitate such access. Limited availability of naloxone in
pharmacies, lack of knowledge or understanding by pharmacy staff of the
standing order, and variability in out-of-pocket cost for this drug are
among these potential barriers. Regulatory or legal incentives for
pharmacies or drug manufacturers, education efforts directed toward
pharmacy staff members, or other interventions may be needed to increase
naloxone availability in pharmacies.

N2  - Background The generalizability of data derived from patient-reported
outcome measures (PROMs) depends largely on the proportion of the
relevant population that completes PROM surveys. However, PROM survey
responses remain low, despite efforts to increase participation. Social
incentives, such as the offer to make a charitable donation on behalf of
the survey respondent, have generally not been effective where online
surveys are concerned, but this has not been extensively tested in
medicine.
Questions/purposes (1) Do personalized social incentives increase
response rates or response completeness for postoperative PROM surveys
in an orthopaedic population? (2) Are there demographic factors
associated with response and nonresponse to postoperative PROM surveys?
(3) Are some demographic factors associated with increased response to
social incentive offers?
Methods Participants were selected from an institutional orthopaedics
database. Patients were older than 18 years, had an email address on
file, and had undergone one of the following procedures 1 to 2 years
ago: Achilles tendon repair, ACL reconstruction, meniscectomy, hip
arthroscopy, TKA, or THA. Of 4685 eligible patients, 3000 (64%) were
randomly selected for inclusion in the study. Participants were
randomized to one of four groups: (1) control: no incentive (n = 750);
(2) patient donation: offer of a USD 5 donation to provide medical
supplies to a pediatric orthopaedic patient (n = 751); (3) research
donation: offer of a USD 5 donation to a procedure-specific research
program (n = 749); or (4) explanation: explanation that response
supports quality improvement (n = 750). The four groups did not differ
regarding patient age, gender, race, procedure type, or time since
procedure. All patients were sent an email invitation with the same PROM
survey link. The proportion of patients who responded (defined here as
the response rate) was measured at 4 weeks and compared between
intervention groups. We used a logistic regression analysis to identify
demographic factors associated with response while controlling for
confounding variables and performed subgroup analyses to determine any
demographic factors associated with increased response to social
incentives.
Results There was no difference in the overall response rate (research
donation: 49% {[}353 of 725], patient donation: 45% {[}333 of 734],
control: 45% {[}322 of 723], explanation: 44% {[}314 of 719]; p =
0.239) or response completeness (research donation: 89% {[}315 of 353],
patient donation: 90% {[}301 of 333], control: 89% {[}287 of 322],
explanation: 87% {[}274 of 314]; p = 0.647) between the four groups.
Women (odds ratio {[}OR], 1.175; p = 0.042), older patients (< 58 years:
OR, 1.016 per 1-year increase; p = 0.001; 58-64 years: OR, 1.023 per
1-year increase; p < 0.001; > 64 years: OR, 1.021 per 1-year increase; p
< 0.001), and white patients (OR 2.034 compared with black patients, p <
0.001) were slightly more likely to respond, after controlling for
potential confounding variables such as gender, age, race, and procedure
type. In subgroup analyses, men (research donation: 49% {[}155 of 316],
patient donation: 45% {[}146 of 328], control: 40% {[}130 of 325],
explanation: 39% {[}127 of 325]; p = 0.041) and patients younger than
58 years (research donation: 40% {[}140 of 351], control: 35% {[}130
of 371], patient donation: 32% {[}113 of 357], explanation: 27% {[}93
of 340]; p = 0.004) were slightly more likely to respond to the research
donation than those with other interventions were.
Conclusions Despite small effects in specific subgroups, personalized
social incentives did not increase the overall response to postoperative
orthopaedic surveys. Novel and targeted strategies will be necessary to
reach response thresholds that enable healthcare stakeholders to use
PROMs effectively.

N2  - IMPORTANCE People with complex needs account for a disproportionate
amount of Medicare spending, partially because of fragmented care
delivered across multiple practitioners and settings. Accountable care
organization (ACO) contracts give practitioners incentives to improve
care coordination to the extent that coordination initiatives reduce
total spending or improve quality.
OBJECTIVE To assess the association between ACO-reported care management
and coordination activities and quality, utilization, spending, and
health care system interactions in older adults with complex needs.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this cross-sectional study, survey
information on care management and coordination processes from 244
Medicare Shared Savings Program ACOs in the 2017-2018 National Survey of
ACOs (of 351 Medicare ACO respondents; response rate, 69%) conducted
from July 20, 2017, to February 15, 2018, was linked to 2016 Medicare
administrative claims data. Medicare beneficiaries 66 years or older who
were defined as having complex needs because of frailty or 2 or more
chronic conditions associated with high costs and clinical need were
included.
EXPOSURES Beneficiary attribution to ACO reporting comprehensive (top
tertile) care management and coordination activities.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES All-cause prevention quality indicator
admissions, 30-day all-cause readmissions, acute care and critical
access hospital admissions, evaluation and management visits in
ambulatory settings, inpatient days, emergency department visits, total
spending, post-acute care spending, health care contact days, and
continuity of care (from Medicare claims).
RESULTS Among 1402582 Medicare beneficiaries with complex conditions,
the mean (SD) age was 78 (8.0) years and 55.1% were female. Compared
with beneficiaries assigned to ACOs in the bottom tertile of care
management and coordination activities, those assigned to ACOs in the
top tertile had identical median prevention quality indicator admissions
and 30-day all-cause readmissions (0 per beneficiary across all
tertiles), hospitalization and emergency department visits (1.0 per
beneficiary in bottom and top tertiles), evaluation and management
visits in ambulatory settings (14.0 per beneficiary {[}interquartile
range (IQR), 8.0-21.0] in both tertiles), longer median inpatient days
(11.0 {[}IQR, 4.0-33.0] vs 10.0 {[}IQR, 4.0-32.0]), higher median annual
spending ($14 350 {[}IQR, $4876-$36119] vs $14 229 {[}IQR,
$4805-$36 268]), lower median health care contact days (28.0 {[}IQR,
17.0-44.0] vs 29.0 {[}IQR, 18.0-45.0]), and lower continuity-of-care
index (0.12 {[}IQR, 0.08-0.20] vs 0.13 {[}IQR, 0.08-0.21]). Accounting
for within-patient correlation, quality, utilization, and spending
outcomes among patients with complex needs attributed to ACOs were not
statistically different comparing the top vs bottom tertile of care
management and coordination activities.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The ACO self-reports of care management and
coordination capacity were not associated with differences in spending
or measured outcomes for patients with complex needs. Future efforts to
care for patients with complex needs should assess whether strategies
found to be effective in other settings are being used, and if so, why
they fail to meet expectations.

N2  - Objective: The objective of this study was to determine whether
community-based pharmacists in North Carolina have the personal
confidence, comfort level, and resources needed to care appropriately
for and interact with transgender patients.
Methods: Using the North Carolina Board of Pharmacy database, a link to
a 25-item questionnaire was e-mailed to all actively licensed community
pharmacists in North Carolina. Survey items included pharmacist
demographics, prior or current education on transgender health care,
comfort regarding care provision for transgender patients, and the
ability to care for transgender patients at the practice site.
Questionnaire items were developed in collaboration with a pharmacist
who actively participates in the care of transgender patients. The
questionnaire was pilot-tested among a convenience sample of student
pharmacists and pharmacists for feedback on validity and question
structure. The survey was open for 30 days with a reminder sent on day
15. Upon survey completion, participants had the option to be entered
into a drawing to receive a gift card incentive.
Results: In total, 342 surveys were completed of 4784 surveys
distributed, yielding a 7.1% response rate. Three percent of survey
respondents reported receiving education on treating transgender
patients during their respective pharmacy school curricula, and 12% of
respondents sought other forms of transgender education (i.e.,
continuing education). Seventy-one percent of respondents viewed the
role of the pharmacist as important in the care of transgender patients.
Sixty-six percent of respondents were comfortable welcoming transgender
patients into their practice sites, and 36% were comfortable asking for
pronouns.
Conclusion: Survey participants reported a lack of formal or
postgraduate education, which describes a need for accessible education
on transgender care. North Carolina community-based pharmacists believe
that it is within their role as pharmacists to provide gender-affirming
care, but they may need additional training to feel comfortable in
providing this care. (C) 2019 American Pharmacists Association (R).

N2  - This paper introduces an instrumental variables framework for analyzing
how external factors that affect survey response rates can also affect
the composition of the sample of respondents. The method may be useful
for studying survey representativeness, and for assessing the
effectiveness of some of the conventional corrections for survey
nonresponse bias.The paper applies the method to data collected in the
2011 Swiss Electoral Study (SES), in which survey participation
incentives were randomly assigned across members of the original survey
sample. The empirical analysis shows that the incentives increased
response rates substantially. Estimates of a new instrumental variable
parameter called the Complier Average Survey Response (CASR) suggest
that the incentives induced participation among people with more
nationalist political opinions than those who would have participated
without the incentives. Weighting the respondent data to match the
covariate distribution in the target population did not account for the
discrepancy in attitudes between the two groups, suggesting that the
weights would not succeed in removing nonresponse bias.

N2  - This research examines the behavioural response of commuters within the
Greater Dublin Area (GDA), Ireland, to a range of policy incentives
designed to encourage travellers to make greater use of sustainable
travel modes for work. Several policy measures were evaluated using
discrete choice and four stage modelling methods, to estimate the
propensity of commuters to shift to active modes use (walking and
cycling) rather than single occupancy vehicle (SOV). As a means of
appraising the hypothetical introduction of a range of active mode
policy incentives, a stated preference experiment (SP) was created as an
instrument for gathering decision making, mode choice and
socio-demographic data from a sample of commuters in the GDA, based on a
number of designed policy scenarios. ExtenSive transport modelling work
was subsequently conducted with the National Transport Authority (NTA)
of Ireland using the National Regional Modelling System (RMS). A
representation of the policy changes explored in the SP experiment was
made in this four-stage transport model in order to produce real-life
estimates of trip making behaviour and mode share, to test the
behavioural response of the introduction of the policy incentives.
Changes to parameters in the Mode Choice and Trip Assignment stages of
the four-stage model were made to account for improvements made to the
infrastructure and time attributes of walking and cycling in the model.
The modifications were made based on `Do Nothing/Base', `Do Something',
and `Do Maximum' scenarios, which were determined by attribute level
values taken from the SP survey.
The findings produced in this study show a marked inelasticity of
commuters to react in response to improvements made to the level of
service of cycling, while on the contrary exhibiting high levels of
elasticity to changes made to pedestrian infrastructure. Outputs from
these model scenarios found that pedestrians in the GDA were most
sensitive to the policy incentives tested. The results highlight that
investing in improvements to the public realm may be a more worthwhile
investment in order to encourage a modal shift to walking for commuting
trip purposes.

2 Swiss francs), a voucher (cash card worth 10 Swiss francs) and cash (a
10-Swiss-francs' banknote) on young panellists' cooperation and response
rate in three waves of a mature panel study with a sequential multi-mode
design (web-based online survey, CATI, and PAPI). The survey experiment
involved an alternative procedure to analyse the effect of different
types of prepaid incentives, taking selective attrition into account as
well as considering problems related to causal inference. The subjects
were students, from randomly-selected school classes, who had finished
their compulsory school in 2013. The findings are clear: cash provides
the strongest direct, positive effect on the overall response rate and
also on the latency until response after first contact. The other
incentives did not work as efficiently as did cash. Additionally, cash
is the most likely to minimise social selectivity in response. Finally,
cash provides the potential to convert refusals in previous waves into
cooperation.

N2  - Retaining participants in longitudinal studies is a unique
methodological challenge in many areas of investigation, and
specifically for researchers aiming to identify effective interventions
for women experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV). Individuals in
abusive relationships are often transient and have logistical,
confidentiality, and safety concerns that limit future contact. A
natural experiment occurred during a large randomized clinical trial
enrolling women in abusive relationships who were also heavy drinkers,
which allowed for the comparison of two incentive methods to promote
longitudinal retention: cash payment versus reloadable wireless bank
cards. In all, 600 patients were enrolled in the overall trial, which
aimed to incentivize participants using a reloadable bank card system to
promote the completion of 11 weekly interactive voice response system
(IVRS) phone surveys and 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up phone or in
person interviews. The first 145 participants were paid with cash as a
result of logistical delays in setting up the bank card system. At 12
weeks, participants receiving the bank card incentive completed
significantly more IVRS phone surveys, odds ratio (OR) = 2.4, 95%
confidence interval (CI) = {[}0.01, 1.69]. There were no significant
differences between the two groups related to satisfaction or safety
and/or privacy. The bank card system delivered lower administrative
burden for tracking payments for study staff. Based on these and other
results, our large medical research university is implementing
reloadable bank card as the preferred method of participant incentive
payments.

N2  - Introduction: Web-based epidemiologic surveys are being widely used, but
still present lower response rates compared to traditional methods.
Their design can influence survey response rates. Objective: Analyse the
influence of questionnaire length, frequency of reminders, and the
interaction between them, on the response rates of five web-based
questionnaires. Methods: This is a 2x2 factorial study. Participants
registered into the coortesnaweb platform (n=1,277) were randomly
assigned to respond to short or long questionnaires, and to receive high
or low frequency of reminders. We analysed the influence of these
factors on the response rates of five web-based questionnaires applied
in a longitudinal manner. The relative risk of responding to an
additional questionnaire was also analysed. Results: The mean response
rate was 54.3%. Sending reminders more frequently was positively
associated with the response rates for the first questionnaires.
Questionnaire length did not influence response rates. We found no
interaction between questionnaire length and frequency of reminders.
Women and highly educated participants had, respectively, 13.0% and
28.0% increased probability of responding an additional questionnaire.
Conclusions: We obtained high response rates for the first
questionnaires. Sending reminders more frequently and providing
conditional incentives should be employed. Long questionnaires did not
jeopardize response rates of web-based questionnaires.

N2  - BackgroundTo determine which resident and program characteristics
correlate with ophthalmic knowledge, as assessed by resident Ophthalmic
Knowledge Assessment Program (OKAP) performance.MethodsAn online survey
was sent in June 2017 to all US ophthalmology residents who took the
OKAP in April 2017.ResultsThe survey response rate was 13.8% (192/1387
residents). The mean respondent age was 30.4years, and 57.3% were male.
The mean {[}SD] self-reported 2017 OKAP percentile was 61.9 {[}26.7].
OKAP performance was found to have a significant positive correlation
with greater number of hours spent/week studying for the OKAPs
(p=0.007), with use of online question banks (p<0.001), with review
sessions and/or lectures arranged by residency programs (p<0.001), and
with OKAP-specific didactics (p=0.002). On multivariable analysis,
factors most predictive of residents scoring 75th percentile were,
higher step 1 scores (OR=2.48, {[}95% CI: 1.68-3.64, p<0.001]),
presence of incentives (OR=2.75, {[}95% CI: 1.16-6.56, p=0.022]),
greater number of hours/week spent studying (OR=1.09, {[}95%
CI:1.01-1.17, p=0.026]) and fewer hours spent in research 3months prior
to examination (OR=1.08, {[}95% CI: 1.01-1.15, p=0.020]. Lastly,
residents less likely to depend on group study sessions as a learning
method tended to score higher (OR=3.40, {[}95% CI: 1.16-9.94,
p=0.026]).ConclusionsPrograms wishing to improve resident OKAP scores
might consider offering incentives, providing effective access to
learning content e.g. online question banks, and adjusting the
curriculum to highlight OKAP material. Step 1 scores may help educators
identify residents who might be at risk of not performing as well on the
OKAP.

N2  - Several studies have shown that high response rates are not associated
with low bias in survey data. This paper shows that, for face-to-face
surveys, the relationship between response rates and bias is moderated
by the type of sampling method used. Using data from Rounds 1 through 7
of the European Social Survey, we develop two measures of selection
bias, then build models to explore how sampling method, response rate,
and their interaction affect selection bias. When interviewers are
involved in selecting the sample of households or respondents for the
survey, high reported response rates can in fact be a sign of poor data
quality. We speculate that the positive association detected between
response rates and selection bias is because of interviewers' incentives
to select households and respondents who are likely to complete the
survey.

N2  - Short message service (SMS) surveys are fast, inexpensive, and
increasingly common. However, there is limited research on this new
mode. Using an experimental design, we conducted general population SMS
surveys in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda. This article (1) reports
the levels and components of nonresponse; (2) evaluates the
representativeness of SMS surveys relative to benchmark data; and (3)
explores strategies to improve representativeness. We find that SMS
surveys underrepresent women, older people, those with less education,
and less technologically savvy people. Sending reminders improved
representativeness, but offering shorter surveys or higher incentives
did not. We conclude that presently, general population SMS surveys
cannot replace face-to-face surveys. Our article provides practical
guidance for survey designers and directions for future research.

N2  - Understanding how metapopulations persist in dynamic working landscapes
requires assessing the behaviors of key actors that change patches as
well as intrinsic factors driving turnover. Coupled human and natural
systems (CHANS) research uses a multidisciplinary approach to identify
the key actors, processes, and feedbacks that drive metapopulation and
landscape dynamics. We describe a framework for modeling metapopulations
in CHANS that integrates ecological and social data by coupling
stochastic patch occupancy models of metapopulation dynamics with
agent-based models of land-use change. We then apply this framework to
metapopulations of the threatened black rail (Laterallus jamaicensis)
and widespread Virginia rail (Rallus limicola) that inhabit patchy,
irrigation-fed wetlands in the rangelands of the California Sierra
Nevada foothills. We collected data from five diverse sources (rail
occupancy surveys, land-use change mapping, a survey of landowner
decision making, climate and reservoir databases, and mosquito trapping
and West Nile virus testing) and integrated them into an agent-based
stochastic patch occupancy model. We used the model to (1) quantify the
drivers of metapopulation dynamics, and the potential interactions and
feedbacks among them; (2) test predictions of the behavior of
metapopulations in dynamic working landscapes; and (3) evaluate the
impact of three policy options on metapopulation persistence (irrigation
district water cutbacks during drought, incentives for landowners to
create wetlands, and incentives for landowners to protect wetlands).
Complex metapopulation dynamics emerged when landscapes functioned as
CHANS, highlighting the importance of integrating human activities and
other ecological processes into metapopulation models. Rail
metapopulations were strongly top-down regulated by precipitation, and
the black rail's decade-long decline was caused by the combination of
West Nile virus and drought. Theoretical predictions of the two
metapopulations' responses to dynamic landscapes and incentive programs
were complicated by heterogeneity in patch quality and CHANS couplings,
respectively. Irrigation cutbacks during drought posed a serious
extinction risk that neither incentive policy effectively ameliorated.

N2  - Employee energy benefits (EEBs), such as subsidies for employee home
energy audits and financial incentives for carpooling to work, aim to
influence employees' environmental behaviors outside of work. Exploring
these understudied benefits would offer new insights that can enrich
theories of employer and employee motivations for engaging in
environmental behavior, as well as reveal new strategies for making
significant progress on environment goals. By drawing upon employer
reports and conducting a survey of 482 US adults employed full-time, we
found that there are a wide range of types of EEBs currently offered by
employers, and furthermore, they were more likely to be offered in
certain industries, such as state and local governments but not others
such as retail. These benefits were offered to 17% of employees and
included a vast array of strategies and approaches. Guided by theorizing
on employer and employee motivation, open-ended responses suggested
employers were perceived to offer EEBs to maximize competiveness and
because of social responsibility concerns, and employees tended to
enroll because they wanted to save money and time or because they cared
about the environment. Finally, EEBs were linked to employee
environmental behavior and morale. The findings reveal new information
about the types of EEBs being offered, motivations for offering and
enrolling in EEBs, and their relationship to employee behavior and
morale. This work suggests numerous lines of promising new research.

N2  - This article investigates how parties respond to polling results on the
campaign trail. I argue that parties use pre-election polls as
mobilization and fine-tuning devices. Opinion surveys that exceed
expectations can be exploited to mobilize the party base. Disappointing
polls, in turn, are publicly downplayed and criticized. However, this
information can be used to refine campaign strategies. Parties
underperforming in the polls have incentives to emphasize their own
policy positions and to attack other parties. These arguments are
supported by evidence from 2140 campaign statements by Portuguese party
leaders over two elections, combined with polling results. The findings
suggest that parties carefully adjust their campaign rhetoric in
response to public opinion signals. The study contributes to research on
elite behavior and political representation. Moreover, it shows how
research on campaign effects can benefit from a closer attention to the
supply-side of campaigns.

pro-social populationand ask whether these same conclusions apply.
MethodsTo evaluate the relative effectiveness of different incentive
strategies, we randomly assign individuals to one of five conditions. We
consider altruistic incentives (a narrative appeal or a charitable
donation) and monetary incentives (three separate lotteries).
ResultsAmong pro-social individuals, less is more: altruistic appeals
are just as effective, if not more effective, than costly monetary
incentives. Moreover, the simplest lottery structure (fewer large-payoff
prizes) is the most cost effective of the lotteries.
ConclusionsThe target population of interest matters when designing
survey incentive strategies. Moreover, increasing the incentives budget
is not always beneficial.

N2  - Objectives Community pharmacists dispensed 68.4% of all drugs used in
Korea, but reported only 2.0% of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in 2011.
This study compared community pharmacists' understanding of the
importance of ADR management and their actual practice of it, and
identified relevant factors related to their management of ADR. Methods
With the use of a modified health belief model (HBM), 800 community
pharmacists were surveyed via social network service messaging. A total
of 200 usable responses were obtained for an effective response rate of
25.0%. Descriptive analysis was used to quantify the differences
between community pharmacists' understanding of the importance of ADR
prevention and their practice. A hierarchical regression was performed
with the following predictors: (1) demographic factors, (2) social
impact of ADR prevention, (3) importance of social support, and (4)
cognition about the importance of ADR prevention. Results Although
community pharmacists clearly recognized the importance of ADR
management, their performance was very low. The disparity between
cognition and performance was more pronounced for ADR reporting than for
patient counseling. Social support was the most powerful predictor of
ADR prevention practice, explaining 18.5% of the variance in ADR
prevention practice. Social impact of ADR prevention, demographic
factors, and cognition about the importance of ADR prevention explained
12.6%, 6.2%, and 1.8% of the variance, respectively. Conclusions
Strengthening community pharmacists' performance of population-based ADR
management should be prioritized over patient-oriented ADR management.
To improve public health, community pharmacists should make an effort at
ADR reporting. This can be done with appropriate government support,
such as incentives to community pharmacists, public awareness campaigns,
education, and establishment of feedback systems.

N2  - This paper proposes and tests a better-defined interpretation of the
different responses of gasoline demand to tax changes and to
market-related price changes. Namely, the signaling effect of gasoline
taxes is one that impacts on long-run consumer decisions in addition to
the incentives provided by tax-inclusive gasoline prices. Our hypothesis
is tested using a complete demand system augmented with information on
gasoline taxes and fitted to household-level data from the 2006 to 2013
rounds of the US Consumer Expenditure survey. Information on gasoline
taxes is found to be a significant determinant of household demand
additional to tax-inclusive gasoline prices. The equity implications are
examined by contrasting the incidence across income distribution of a
simulated $0.22/gallon tax increase to that of a market-related price
increase equal in size. The tax increase is clearly regressive, slightly
more than the market-related price increase. However, regressivity is by
no means a reason to give up gasoline taxes as an instrument for
reducing gasoline consumption externalities. Their high effectiveness in
reducing gasoline demand implies that small tax increases can
substantially improve the environment while minimizing the related
distributional effects. Also, gasoline taxes generate revenue that can
be used to offset their regressivity.

mobile technology impacted students' learning motivation and achievement
and how the learning processes proceeded. Data were collected through
surveys, student assignments, exams, learning journals, and interviews.
The results indicated that the implementation of ``Kahoot!{''} can
enhance these rural-area students' learning motivation, gain the
rural-area students' attention, and create incentives for the students
to preview and review learning materials promoting learning efficiency.
Moreover, the integration enhanced learning achievement. On the other
hand, the teachable moments Kahoot! created may not be sustainable. It

N2  - Electric vehicles (EVs) can be regarded as a kind of demand response
(DR) resource. Nevertheless, the EVs travel behavior is flexible and
random, in addition, their willingness to participate in the DR event is
uncertain, they are expected to be managed and utilized by the EV
aggregator (EVA). In this perspective, this paper presents a composite
methodology that take into account the dynamic road network (DRN)
information and fuzzy user participation (FUP) for obtaining
spatio-temporal projections of demand response potential from electric
vehicles and the electric vehicle aggregator. A dynamic traffic network
model taking over the traffic time-varying information is developed by
graph theory. The trip chain based on housing travel survey is set up,
where Dijkstra algorithm is employed to plan the optimal route of EVs,
in order to find the travel distance and travel time of each trip of
EVs. To demonstrate the uncertainties of the EVs travel pattern,
simulation analysis is conducted using Monte Carlo method. Subsequently,
we suggest a fuzzy logic-based approach to uncertainty analysis that
starts with investigating EV users' subjective ability to participate in
DR event, and we develop the FUP response mechanism which is constructed
by three factors including the remaining dwell time, remaining SOC, and
incentive electricity pricing. The FUP is used to calculate the
real-time participation level of a single EV. Finally, we take advantage
of a simulation example with a coupled 25-node road network and 54-node
power distribution system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method.

N2  - In South Korea, renewable energy policy is mainly focused on electricity
and tends to neglect renewable heat (RH). However, for the purpose of
reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the heating sector must sharply
switch from its use of conventional fuels to renewable sources. The
South Korean Government is considering an RH incentive (RHI) program
with financial and policy support schemes and is thus demanding
information about residential consumers' acceptance of the RHI program
to expand the use of RH. Therefore, this study looked into residential
consumers' acceptance of the introduction of the RHI program by applying
contingent valuation (CV). For this purpose, a CV survey of 600
interviewees was conducted using a dichotomous choice question format
that asked a respondent if she/he is willing to pay a given amount.
Furthermore, among the various dichotomous choice question formats, the
one-and-one-half-bounded format, which is considered desirable in terms
of efficiency as well as consistency, was applied. One point to note in
analyzing the CV responses was that not a few interviewees had zero
willingness to pay (WTP). Thus, a spike model was employed to deal with
the dichotomous choice CV data with a number of zero observations. The
results revealed that the household mean WTP amounted to KRW 5753 (USD
5.35) per year. If we look at this value from a national perspective, it
is worth KRW 113.63 billion (USD 105.61 million) per year. This value
corresponds to the economic value or benefits that the introduction of
an RHI program provides to the South Korean people each year and needs
to be compared to the costs that the introduction of RHI will incur.

N2  - Purpose
To measure community-based preceptors' overall satisfaction and
motivations, the influence of students on preceptors' practices, and
compare with 2005 and 2011 studies.
Method
North Carolina primary care preceptors across disciplines (physicians,
pharmacists, advanced practice nurses, physician assistants) received
survey invitations via e-mail, fax, postcard, and/or full paper survey.
Most questions in 2017 were the same as questions used in prior years,
including satisfaction with precepting, likelihood to continue
precepting, perceived influence of teaching students in their practice,
and incentives for precepting. A brief survey or phone interview was
conducted with 62 nonresponders. Chi-square tests were used to examine
differences across discipline groups and to compare group responses over
time.
Results
Of the 2,786 preceptors contacted, 893 (32.1%) completed
questionnaires. Satisfaction (816/890; 91.7%) and likelihood of
continuing to precept (778/890; 87.4%) remained unchanged from 2005 and
2011. However, more preceptors reported a negative influence for patient
flow (422/888; 47.5%) in 2017 than in 2011 (452/1,266; 35.7%) and 2005
(496/1,379; 36.0%) (P < .0001), and work hours (392/889; 44.1%) in
2017 than in 2011 (416/1,268; 32.8%) and 2005 (463/1,392; 33.3%) (P <
.0001). Importance of receiving payment for teaching increased from
32.2% (371/1,152) in 2011 to 46.4% (366/789) in 2017 (P< .0001).
Conclusions
This 2017 survey suggests preceptor satisfaction and likelihood to
continue precepting have remained unchanged from prior years. However,
increased reporting of negative influence of students on practice and
growing value of receiving payment highlight growing concerns about
preceptors' time and finances and present a call to action.

hindered their implementation, resulting in a recast of the

an ongoing change in the housing market, as energy efficiency achieves a
high importance score similar to that of rent resp. price and of
location. Owners are significantly more familiar with the EPC tool,
giving it stronger consideration than tenants do. The results indicate
three main policy implications concerning enhanced (i) transparency
regulation and its compliance, (ii) environmental awareness, and (iii)
communication of economic incentives.

N2  - To reduce energy consumption and environmental pollution, the Chinese
government is vigorously promoting the adoption of electric vehicles
(EVs). As one of the first demonstration and promotion cities for EVs in
China, Beijing has played an important leading role in the promotion of
EVs. Based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB), this study
introduced consumer cognitive status, product perception, and incentive
policy measures (non-monetary incentive policy measures and monetary
incentive policy measures) to build a purchase intention influence
mechanism model for EVs. A questionnaire survey was conducted from March
to April of 2018 among potential consumers in Beijing. A total of 502
valid survey responses were obtained, and a structural equation model
(SEM) was used for an empirical analysis of the factors influencing EV
purchasing intention. The results show that attitude, perceived behavior
control, cognitive status, product perception and monetary incentive
policy measures have significant positive effects on consumers'
intentions to purchase EVs in Beijing. However, subjective norms and non
monetary incentive policy measures have no significant impact on
purchasing intention. In addition, the analysis results of the
multi-group SEM show that there are significant differences in
demographic variables (gender, age, education level, income, and
ownership of cars) in the path of consumer purchase intention.
Implications for policy makers and scope for further research are
discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - A large amount of information is required to model the complex trade-off
processes between travel activities, non-travel activities and budget
assignment at the individual level. This paper describes the development
of a new survey design, which incorporates components of travel surveys,
time use surveys and consumer expenditure surveys in an integrated
format, which is expected to deliver a richer data set allowing deeper
insights into individuals' activity and consumption patterns. The survey
procedure and the incentives paid, which were necessary to obtain
acceptable response rates, are also described. Results from two pilot
studies using a trip-based and an activity-based diary format are
presented. The paper examines to which extent the diaries have been
capable of collecting the required data with high quality and response
rates. The innovative Mobility-Activity-Expenditure-Diary is introduced
and results of the main survey using this design are presented. Travel
behaviour and non-travel activities were reported at high quality.
Expenditures would require longer observation periods (and preferably
not only telephone but also personal support in the survey process) to
reduce unsystematic variations and to better capture individuals' long
term equilibrium.

N1  - 14th International Conference of the

Behaviour Research, Windsor, ENGLAND, JUL, 2015
N2  - The main research question addressed by this study is to what degree
individuals would change travel modes, time allocation and activity
patterns after experiencing large changes in generalized transportation
costs and how they would react regarding their longer-term ownership in
mobility tools, assessing suppressed demand effects from an
activity-based perspective. The empirical basis is a multi-day travel
and online diary that is required to obtain the personalized reference
values for the later stated choice and stated adaptation tasks. This
paper provides first detailed information of the survey methods,
recruitment and fieldwork. An initial investigation of the data and its
quality attributes, descriptions of the sampling structure and response
behavior are presented. Participation choice models indicate that a high
incentive level leads to a higher participation rate, but the net-effect
on completing the survey is zero: once recruited, higher incentives also
lead to a higher drop-out incidence. Certain socioeconomic
characteristics are consistently overrepresented in the sample: season
ticket ownership, better education and higher income strongly increase
participation and completion of the survey. Findings reveal saliency
effects, whereby response behavior is influenced by the respondents'
interest in the survey topic. While general fatigue effects can only be
detected for the number of reported online activities, better educated
and car-less respondents exhibit an increased reporting behavior of
trips over time. Importantly, while showing no effects on completion of
the survey, higher incentives tend to increase response quality in terms
of absolute levels (trips) and stability (online activities).

N2  - Background: Albeit limited, research suggests that students pursuing
careers in health care receive limited training on the provision of
services for people with hearing loss. As the incidence of hearing loss
continues to increase among Americans, it is critical that medical
professionals understand how hearing loss among patients may affect the
manner in which they can provide services most effectively.
Purpose: The aim of this project is to assess the amount of experience
and confidence that preprofessional health-care students at one
university obtain during the course of their training and whether these
students would be interested in additional information related to
hearing health.
Research Design: Preprofessional health-care students in terminal degree
programs at one university completed a survey regarding the provision of
services for individuals with hearing loss. Students were asked to
quantify their prior training on topics related to hearing loss, report
their perceptions of the benefits and barriers to screening hearing, and
report their self-efficacy in providing services for individuals with
hearing loss. Additional survey items investigated students' interest in
receiving further training on these topics.
Study Sample: Participants (n = 95; 16.2% response rate) were students
at a mid-sized, Midwestern university who were pursuing the following
terminal degrees: medicine, physician assistant, nursing, pharmacy,
physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology, and
respiratory therapy (bachelor's degree in respiratory care).
Participants were selected based on membership in an interdisciplinary
education training program. All students in this program received an
invitation to participate in the study. Of the participants, 68 (71.6%)
were Caucasian and 86 (90.5%) were female.
Data Collection and Analysis: A 28-item online survey on various topics
related to hearing loss was used to document student responses. All
students enrolled in a university's interdisciplinary professional
education course (n = 586) received an online link to the survey via an
initial email, which contained a brief introduction to the study, the
assurance of response anonymity, and a statement regarding implied
consent. A second email was sent to students, which reminded
participants of the request to complete the survey.
Results: Overall, 60% of participants reported an interest in receiving
additional information on hearing health and 66.3% of respondents
indicated that they wished to receive training via an in-service or
internet workshop facilitated by their university program. Most of the
participants reported that they had not received training and did not
feel confident identifying the signs and symptoms of hearing loss and
making an appropriate referral, which led to the request for additional
information.
Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that preprofessional
health-care students have an interest in receiving additional education
on various topics related to hearing loss including a better
understanding of how hearing loss impacts the quality of life in
affected individuals. These findings provide an incentive to provide
additional training related to hearing loss identification and
management for preprofessional health-care students to foster increased
competency and improved patient care.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: In recent years, researchers have been working towards
creating a standard conceptual framework of food parenting. To
understand how parents' reports correspond with the proposed model, the
current study examined parents' reports of their feeding behaviours in
the context of a newly established framework of food parenting.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional, with a two-week follow-up for a subset of the
sample. Participants completed a quantitative and qualitative survey to
assess food parenting. The survey included items from common food
parenting instruments to measure the constructs posited in the
framework. Exploratory factor analyses were conducted to ascertain which
items related most closely to one another and factors were mapped on to
existing constructs.
SETTING: Online.ParticipantsParents of children aged 2.5-7 years (n
496). Of these, 122 completed a two-week follow-up.
RESULTS: Analyses revealed eleven aspects of Structure (monitoring;
distraction; family presence; meal/snack schedule; unstructured
practices; healthy/unhealthy food availability; food preparation;
healthy/unhealthy modelling; rules), ten aspects of Coercive Control
(pressure to eat; using food to control emotions; food incentives to
eat; food incentives to behave; non-food incentives to eat; restriction
for health/weight; covert restriction; clean plate; harsh coercion) and
seven aspects of Autonomy Promotion (praise; encouragement; nutrition
education; child involvement; negotiation; responsive feeding; repeated
offering). Content validity, assessed via parents' open-ended
explanations of their responses, was high, and test-retest reliability
was moderate to high. Structure and Autonomy Promoting food parenting
were highly positively correlated.
CONCLUSIONS: In general, parents' responses provided support for the
model, but suggested some amendments and refinements.

N2  - There is a substantial literature estimating the responsiveness of
charitable donations to tax incentives for giving in the USA. One
approach estimates the price elasticity of giving based on tax return
data of individuals who itemize their deductions, a group substantially
wealthier than the average taxpayer. Another estimates the price
elasticity for the average taxpayer based on general population survey
data. Broadly, results from both arms of the literature present a
counterintuitive conclusion: the price elasticity of donations of the
average taxpayer is larger than that of the average, wealthier,
itemizer. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that this
conclusion results from a heretofore unrecognized downward bias in the
estimator of the price elasticity of giving when non-itemizers are
included in the estimation sample (generally with survey data). An
intuitive modification to the standard model used in the literature is
shown to yield a consistent and more efficient estimator of the price
elasticity for the average taxpayer under a testable restriction. Strong
empirical support is found for this restriction, and we estimate a bias
in the price elasticity around -1, suggesting the existing literature
significantly over-estimates (in absolute value) the price elasticity of
giving. Our results provide evidence of an inelastic price elasticity
for the average taxpayer, with a statistically significant and elastic
price response found only for households in the top decile of income.

N2  - Introduction: This study evaluates the effect of program and incentive
characteristics on satisfaction with incentives and perceived impact of
incentives on behavior change among Medicaid beneficiaries who
participated in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Medicaid
Incentives for Prevention of Chronic Diseases program.
Methods: In 2014-2015, an English- and Spanish-language survey was
administered to Medicaid Incentives for Prevention of Chronic Diseases
program participants about their satisfaction with incentives and
perceived impact of incentives. Completed surveys were received from
2,276 eligible sample members (response rate=52.7%). In 2016-2017,
multilevel, multivariable, ordinal logistic regression models were
performed to examine program characteristics that predict outcomes,
while controlling for respondent characteristics.
Results: Medicaid Incentives for Prevention of Chronic Diseases
participants were satisfied with program incentives. Most survey
respondents strongly agreed that they liked getting incentives for
taking care of their health (78%), they were happy with the incentives
overall (75%), the incentives were fair (73%), and they liked how
often they received incentives (67%). Participants in programs
delivered by telephone reported higher satisfaction with incentives
compared with those in programs delivered in person. However,
participants in programs delivered both in person and by telephone were
more likely to perceive a positive impact of incentives. Incentive form
was a significant predictor of satisfaction with incentives but not of
incentive impact. Dollar amount of incentives influenced satisfaction
with incentives and impact of incentives.
Conclusions: Program delivery method, incentive form, and incentive
magnitude are important characteristics to consider when designing
incentive programs. Incentive programs can consider providing modest
incentive amounts to achieve self-reported impact on behavior change.

N2  - Aim: International guidelines highlight the importance of implementation
supports and quality monitoring of multidisciplinary care for breast
cancer. In Canada, Ontario has standards for formal multidisciplinary
cancer conferences (MCCs), but other provinces/territories do not. This
study aimed to stocktake MCCs for breast cancer in Canadian sites
participating in the RUBY cohort study (Reducing the Burden of Breast
Cancer in Young Women) to better understand variations in
multidisciplinary care across Canada and to add to the international
literature.
Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with surgeons and
surgical oncologists representing 34 clinical centres participating in
RUBY. Questions were grouped according to: type of multidisciplinary
care, implementation, function, practice, participation and
presentation, operation, and demographics, and included a mix of
Likert-based, tick box and open-ended questions.
Results: Twenty-two responses (65%) were received. 91% of respondents
reported that formal MCCs are part of regular practice. However,
variation exists in the supports in place for ongoing implementation of
MCCs, the understanding of the functions of MCCs, and the patients
presented for discussion. Results also suggest less formalized processes
for MCC in provinces without practice standards.
Conclusions: Response differences between Ontario and elsewhere suggest
that standards for MCC and supports for their implementation make a
positive difference in their operation. However, ongoing operational
challenges and issues with attendance exist for all sites and suggest
that along with development of practice standards, incentives for
participation and further education on benefits and function of MCC may
support uptake of MCCs in clinical practice. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All

N2  - Purpose Drawing on a sample of 520 negative reviews posted on
TripAdvisor against all five-star hotels operating in Petra, Jordan, the
purpose of this paper is to evaluate the response of luxury hotels to
negative online reviews by considering the Response Rate (RR), the
Response Time (RT) and the Response Content (RC).
Design/methodology/approach A deductive content analysis was used on
hotels' managerial responses. Based on the literature review, a
four-construct scheme was identified to guide the analysis including
Appreciation; Apology; Explanation; and Incentive. The managerial
responses were carefully read and manually coded based on the
four-construct scheme. The time between the review posting date and the
date of the managerial response was also recorded. Luxury hotel managers
were also surveyed to obtain insights into their perceptions and
practices with respect to online reputation management. Findings The
findings call into question luxury hotels' awareness of the harmful
impact of negative online reviews. Specifically, the findings suggest
that less than half of the negative reviews received a managerial
response, and that more than half of these were standardized and did not
refer to the issues raised in the reviews. The low response rate coupled
with the hotel managers' consensus on the importance of answering all
online reviews indicates inconsistency between hotel managers'
perceptions and practices with regard to online reputation management.
Originality/value The paper adds to the ongoing debate on reputation
management in the hospitality industry by considering the managerial
response to negative online reviews. The paper discusses several
managerial implications for hotel managers as well as avenues for future
research.

a nationwide study designed to compare the health of U.S. Vietnam era
veterans to age- and sex-matched U.S. residents. Two self-administered
mail questionnaires, one for veterans and the other for the U.S.
nonmilitary population, were developed using already validated and newly
developed items. A pretest was conducted to evaluate item recall and
comprehension, new-item response validity, and the overall survey
experience (usability of survey materials including the screener
questionnaire for nonveterans). Subject recruitment was completed using
convenience sampling and a $50 incentive. Cognitive interviewing and
usability interviewing, two qualitative research methods, were
implemented. Interviews were conducted in two stages (Stage 1, cognitive
interviewing, n = 12; Stage 2, usability testing, n = 8) by three
experienced methodologists. Concurrent probing techniques, unscripted
probes, and retroactive probing were used to elicit response from 14
veterans and six nonveterans (mostly male, White, and aged 65-70 years).
Information about the overall survey process was also obtained through
observation during usability testing. Results signify that qualitative
research is an important part of questionnaire development targeting
older veterans due to issues involving comprehension, interpretability,
and recall.

Australians to inform future workforce planning and service development
in response to an ageing population and aged care sector reform. Method:
Data were collected through snowball distribution of an online survey
comprising six sections: demographic details; caseload and service
delivery practices, degree of inter-professional practice; engagement
with professional development and support; and assessment and management
of swallowing, mealtime and communication difficulties. All data were
analysed using descriptive statistics and chi-square to determine the
independence of key variables. Result: Data from 145 speech-language
pathologists highlight the need for increased numbers of clinicians
working outside of metropolitan areas and greater workforce diversity,
along with increased incentive, supervision and inter-professional
support for new graduate and early career clinicians considering working
outside of hospital settings. To ensure evidence-based practice, further
research into the validity of current assessment and intervention
methods used across aged care settings is needed. Conclusion: The
findings highlight the need for an extended scope of practice and
improved models of support for speech-language pathologists working with
older people to better respond to the needs of an ageing population and

N2  - As peak demand for electricity continues to rise, distributors have
begun charging small and medium-sized users for their short term demand
rather than just their energy use. This is not only to meet the
political aspirations for increased demand-side flexibility that now
exist in many corners of the world, but to make sure that users are
charged for the costs they incur. As it is only until recently that this
type of users have come to face demand charges, there are however very
few studies on what the actual effects of such pricing policies are, and
those studies that do exist suffer from different methodological
shortcomings that reduce their validity as a basis for real-world policy
evaluations. This study provides the first state-of-the-art causal
analysis of the demand response effects of a billing demand charge
involuntarily introduced to small and medium sized users (35-63 A),
using novel two-level time series models on retrospective observational
consumption and survey data. Our analyses suggest that the tariff has
induced an average response of -0.32 kWh/day per user over a two year
long posttreatment period in comparison to a matched control group,
equal to 7.4% of their daily average use during the pretreatment
period. The response seems to have increased over time and to be greater
during wintertime: around -0.70 kWh/day or 16.2% of the treated users'
average daily use during the pretreatment period. Comparing the
individual users' response to the size of their financial incentive to
respond given the new tariff as well as their self-reported perception
of the relative importance of electricity expenditures, we did not find
any support for the common assumption that users with a higher financial
incentive to respond do so to a greater extent. This might suggest that
small and medium-sized commercial users, just as residential users, may
exhibit non-financial drivers and barriers for engaging in demand
response that may be vital to understand as policy makers and industry
continue to seek increased demand-side flexibility.

with buprenorphine is a cornerstone of the opioid crisis response, yet
buprenorphine remains underutilized. Research has identified multiple
barriers to prescribing buprenorphine. This study aimed to examine
clinician characteristics, prescribing practices and barriers and
incentives to prescribing buprenorphine among clinicians with a federal
Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 (DATA) waiver to prescribe
buprenorphine for opioid use disorder treatment. Design Electronic
survey of 4225 clinicians conducted between March and April 2018.
Setting United States. Participants Clinicians obtaining an initial
federal DATA waiver or an increase in authorized patient limit to
prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorder treatment in 2017.
Measurements Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic
regression examined clinician characteristics, prescribing practices and
primary barriers and incentives to prescribing buprenorphine or
prescribing at or near the authorized patient limit. Findings Among
respondents, 75.5% had prescribed buprenorphine since obtaining a DATA
waiver; the mean (standard deviation) number of patients treated in the
past month was 26.6 (40.3), and 13.1% of providers were prescribing at
or near their patient limit in the past month. Lack of patient demand,
cited by 19.4% of clinicians, was the most common primary barrier to
prescribing buprenorphine or prescribing to the authorized patient
limit, followed by time constraints in practice (14.6%) and insurance
reimbursement, prior authorization or other insurance requirements
(13.2%). Increased patient demand (22.2%), institutional support for
buprenorphine treatment (12.5%) and increased reimbursement (12.2%)
were the most endorsed primary incentives for buprenorphine prescribing.
Multivariable logistic regression models identified multiple clinician
characteristics associated with buprenorphine prescribing and
prescribing at or near the authorized patient limit. Conclusions US
clinicians recently waivered to prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use
disorder treatment appear to prescribe well below their patient limit,
and many do not prescribe at all.

N2  - Social network games (SNGs) are genre of casual games that require being
logged into a social networking site (e.g., Facebook) to access the
gameworld. To date, investigations of these games are typically focused
on the rate of attrition or ``churn,{''} reinforcing the idea that SNG
players exist to make the developer money rather than participating in a
game they derive pleasure from. Seeking to recenter the player in
research about SNGs, this article reports on a survey of former players
(N = 147) who were queried about their reason(s) for no longer
participating in YoWorld, a Facebook-based SNG. Findings indicate that
players typically quit because of external constraints to their leisure
time rather than no longer interested in the game, which are not
barriers to play that can be overcome by personalized in-game
incentives, the typical developer response to prevent churn from taking

N2  - Industrial equipment such as ruggedized handheld computers, scanners,
and label printers used within asset tracking environments are expensive
to purchase and costly to repair. For organizations that use this
equipment, there is value in understanding when and why damage occurs
and how much of those costs are potentially associated with the
employees' own sense of psychological ownership and organizational
pride. Given the connection between psychological ownership and pride,
the purpose of this study was to analyze employee surveys to determine
what methods, tools, or programs could reduce repair and replacement
while developing a stronger sense of ownership for ruggedized devices
used in material-handling industries by shift workers. Unstructured
interviews about device repair with management from a large industrial
company were utilized to create a multiple-choice, anonymous online
survey (n = 353). Of the six interventions proposed, assigning the same
device to the same employee every shift appeared to have the most
consistent and positive response. Destruction rates and costs should be
posted for employee viewing and managers of workgroups with consistently
high destruction rates should receive additional training. An
incentive-based program for employees responsible for the least amount
of device damage as well as an individual-assignment of devices to
employees may be considered. Applications for this student include
providing a tool with which organizations can use to gauge employee
ownership of equipment as well as to identify interventions that may aid
in mitigating expenses associated with industrially rugged equipment.

N2  - A major challenge with surveying physicians is low response. In this
article, we present results of an experiment conducted to determine the
optimal monetary incentive amount for gaining response from physicians
to a short screener survey. Sampled physicians were randomly assigned to
three prepaid cash incentive conditions (US$2, US$5, US$10) compared
to a control (US$0). This study found using any incentive increased
response versus no incentive. The US$10 incentive produced the highest
response and was significantly greater than the US$2 incentive group.
However, we did not find a statistical difference between the $5 and
US$10 incentives or between the US$2 and US$5 incentives. In
addition, any incentive amount increased the likelihood of early
response compared to no incentive. This study builds on previously mixed
results about the effects of various incentive amounts and effect on
early survey response. These findings provide practical advice for
researchers surveying physicians.

N2  - Due to the scarcity of land for urban development, Brownfield
Redevelopment (BR) is considered a sustainable urban land tool in
developed countries, but its adoption in developing countries remains in
its infancy. Barriers impeding BR need to be investigated in detail.
However, few studies have analyzed barriers to BR in developing
countries. This study aims to analyze the critical barriers to BR in
Pakistan by using a two-stage methodology including the Fuzzy Delphi
Method (FDM) and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Initially, 41
barriers were identified through a comprehensive literature review. FDM
screened out 33 barriers through expert opinion. Survey questionnaires
were sent to major stakeholders involved in the BR process. Finally,
valid responses were analyzed using SEM to verify and rank the most
critical barriers. Study results indicated 26 critical barriers. The top
five critical barriers were lack of policy incentives, the complexity of
public-private partnerships, lack of professional and technical
personnel, the conflict between stakeholders, and lack of awareness of
environmental law. A comparative analysis of barriers to BR in Pakistan
and other countries including the USA, Canada, the UK, Germany, and
China showed that critical barriers vary by country. Furthermore, factor
analysis results extracted five major categories for 26 critical
barriers, including political and legal barriers, financial and economic
barriers, technical and operational barriers, management system
barriers, and environmental barriers. The most dominant barrier category
was technical and operational barriers, impeding BR in Pakistan. This
study creates value in the BR literature by identifying the most
critical barriers to BR in a developing country. It could support
practitioners and land use policy makers in developing appropriate
strategies to promote BR. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - What impact have government policies had on the private sector's
response to economic crises, in particular on its decisions for
restructuring and adaptation? The Hungarian machine-building industry
from 1919 to 1949 provides an interesting case study for these
interrelations between business and politics. The study focuses on the
role of cartels in organizing responses to crises. The case study is
based on a survey of the cartel agreements and investigates why cartels
provided solutions only to short-term crises, if they provided solutions
at all. The hypothesis is that government policies played a substantial
part in the story, as they did not provide enough incentives for
coordinated responses to structural change. The years 1919 to 1949
encompass the crises caused by the territorial and political change in
East Central Europe after World War I, the Great Depression, and World
War II and its aftermath. Depicting the responses of the
machine-building industry through the experience of one of its key
companies and its cartels-Ganz & Co.-this article analyzes the
influence of the institutional framework on short- and long-term

N2  - This paper presents and evaluates a novel demand response method for
households, designed for mitigating intermittency in smart grids with a
high share of renewables. The method, named Dynamic Active Demand
Response (DADR), is based on an innovative paradigm of offering multiple
electricity service levels and a dynamic-active demand response scheme.
It provides the grid operator with the ability to influence consumption
patterns in real time, so that responding to renewables intermittency is
more effective in terms of reliability, predictability and response
time.
DADR's performance is evaluated using a Monte Carlo simulation model,
which assesses the method's intermittency mitigation potential and
estimates the expected economic value of implementing it in the Israeli
residential sector. Major components of the model are based on a survey,
conducted among Israeli households. The survey results indicate that,
given a sufficiently attractive economic incentive, participation rates
can reach as high as 85-90%. The Monte Carlo simulation results reveal
that DADR can make a significant contribution to mitigating renewables
intermittency, with energy savings of hundreds to thousands of MWh a day
and a positive net economic benefit. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

N2  - This is Part 2 of a two-part study that explores latent demand for three
types of zero-emissions vehicles (ZEVs): plug-in hybrid electric
vehicles (PHEVs), battery electric vehicles (BEVs), and hydrogen fuel
cell vehicles (HFCVs). Using an in-depth, Reflexive Participant approach
to data collection, our survey instrument includes two measures of
latent demand implemented with a representative sample of 2123 new
vehicle-buying households in Canada in 2017. While Part 1 (Long et al.,
this issue) reports on a design space exercise, here we summarize
results from a stated choice experiment, using a latent class choice
model to quantify respondent preferences and motivations, and the
heterogeneity therein. We identify five unique respondent classes (or
segments) that largely differ by their preferred drivetrain, only three
of which demonstrate significant interest in ZEVs: PEV-enthusiast
(representing 13% of the sample), PHEV-oriented (22%), and ZEV-neutral
(21%). Respondents in all three classes tend to have higher levels of
environmental concern or engagement in an environment-oriented
lifestyle. All classes significantly value purchase price and
incentives, but vary widely in valuation of fuel savings, charging
access, and refueling access - with little overall valuation of driving
range and public charging access. We calculate conditional choice
probabilities as estimates of ZEV latent demand, which is equivalent to
29% of new market share under base conditions, and significantly
increases to a high of 49% with purchase incentives and widespread
charger deployment. Our discussion compares insights provided by the two
stated response approaches to latent demand (in Parts 1 and 2), making a
case for overall complementarity.

N2  - Response rates to mail-based surveys have declined in recent decades,
and survey response rates for farmers tend to be low overall.
Maintaining high response rates is necessary to prevent non-response
bias. Historically, incentives have been an effective tool to increase
response rates with general populations. However, the effect of
incentives on farmers has not been well tested. In this study, we
experimentally manipulated the use of a $2 incentive in two surveys
targeted at farmers. We tested both the use of the incentive and the
timing of incentive distribution in the survey process. We found the
incentive significantly increased response rates with farmers but there
was no significant effect of when the incentive was distributed.
Additionally, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of using the
incentive. While the incentive increased response rate, the cost per
survey response also increased and the cost of the incentive was not
offset by the increased response rate.

N2  - Background: School leaders are challenged by the relatively limited
supply and high turnover of qualified secondary school mathematics
teachers. In response, policy makers and teacher educators have
developed various pathways and incentives to recruit, train, place, and
support highly qualified mathematics teachers to work in hard-to-staff
schools.
Focus of Study: In this study, we investigate the recruitment,
placement, and early career trajectories of 158 Grades 6-12 mathematics
teachers from two preparation programs focused on staffing
``high-need{''} schools in the same region.
Setting: The contrasting programs were both supported by the same
university in the Northeast United States.
Participants & Programs: The participants were 158 secondary school
(Grades 6-12) mathematics teachers. Of these, 48 were recruited and
prepared through a teacher education program with financial support from
the National Science Foundation-funded Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship
Program. The other 110 school mathematics teachers were recruited and
trained through the Greater Boston office of Teach For America. Both
programs required two years of service in high-need schools.
Research Design: In this study, we used a comparative design.
Descriptive profiles of teachers from each program were created. Then,
participants' early career trajectories were compared using logistic
regression and survival analysis.
Data Collection and Analysis: We administered a longitudinal survey and
created a database combining survey data and each program's
administrative data.
Conclusions: Our data illustrate that the Noyce scholarship-supported
pathway was generally successful in recruiting individuals with STEM
majors, training them to be mathematics teachers, and placing those
individuals as secondary school mathematics teachers in high-need
schools. The comparison of the scholarship-pathway teachers with the
secondary school mathematics teachers in the alternative-certification
pathway provides a useful contrast. On the one hand, the alternatively
certified secondary school mathematics teachers were less likely than
the scholarship-pathway teachers to have STEM majors, and the attrition
rate for the alternatively prepared teachers was higher than the
attrition rate for the scholarship-supported teachers, particularly
after they had completed the two-year service requirement. On the other
hand, the alternative-certification program recruited a more diverse
pool of potential teachers and placed these teachers in schools serving
a higher proportion of low-SES students.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To understand physician organization (PO) responses to
financial incentives for quality and total cost of care among POs that
were exposed to a statewide multipayer value-based payment (VBP)
program, and to identify challenges that POs face in advancing the goats
of VBP.
STUDY DESIGN: Semistructured qualitative interviews and survey.
METHODS: We drew a stratified random sample of 40 multispecialty
California POs (25% of the POs that were eligible for incentives).
In-person interviews were conducted with physician leaders and a survey
was administered on actions being taken to reduce costs and redesign
care and to discuss the challenges to improving value. We performed a
thematic analysis of interview transcripts to identify common actions
taken and challenges to reducing costs.
RESULTS: VBP helps to promote care delivery transformation among POs,
although efforts varied across organizations. Investments are occurring
primarily in strategies to control hospital costs and redesign primary
care, particularly for chronically ill patients; specialty care redesign
is largely absent. Physician payment incentives for value remain small
relative to total compensation, with continued emphasis on productivity.
Challenges cited include the lack of a single enterprisewide electronic
health records platform for information exchange, limited ability to
influence specialists who were not exclusive to the organization, tack
of payer cost and utilization data to manage costs, inability to recoup
care redesign investments given the small size of VBP incentives, and
tack of physician cost awareness.
CONCLUSIONS: Transformation could be advanced by strengthening financial
incentives for value; engaging specialists in care redesign and
delivering value; enhancing partnerships among POs, hospitals, and
payers to align quality and cost actions; strengthening information
exchange across providers; and applying other strategies to influence
physician behavior.

surveys can introduce bias. We aimed to develop and assess innovative
methods to incentivise respondents to complete surveys. Methods Adult
men who have sex with men (MSM) living in the USA were recruited through
banner advertisements on Facebook from 27 April 2015 to 6 May 2015 to
participate in an online survey about HIV prevention and risk
behaviours. Participants were randomised to one of four conditions: a
monetary incentive; a series of altruistic messages highlighting the
importance of participating in research; access to a dashboard comparing
their responses with statistics from other participants after
completion; and no incentive. Kaplan-Meier survival methods and
univariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate survey
dropout by incentive group and demographic variables of interest.
Results There were a total of 1178 participants randomised to the four
treatment groups. The rate of survey dropout among participants in the
altruistic (HR=0.68, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.93), monetary (HR=0.44, 95% CI
0.32 to 0.61) and dashboard (HR=0.78, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.06) groups was
lower than the non-incentivised control group. Regardless of condition,
survey dropout was also lower among MSM aged 28-34 (HR=0.67, 95% CI
0.50 to 0.90) compared with those aged 18-22 years old, and MSM who were

N2  - Underwater noise pollution is becoming globally recognised as a
significant threat to aquatic ecosystems and the resources they provide.
The effects of noise pollution extend from blue whales to zooplankton,
impacting threatened species and affecting key industries including
fisheries and ecotourism. In response, policymakers in some
jurisdictions have made substantive high-level commitments to address
noise pollution, however the implementation of noise reduction measures
(noise abatement) remains limited. To support the development of
effective noise management policies, this paper explores the economic
and policy context to noise abatement in three major noise-generating
industries: shipping, offshore windfarm construction, and seismic
surveying for oil and gas. In each case, tractable policy options are
identified which make considered use of command-and-control and
incentive-based measures in light of the available noise abatement
methods. Drawing on instructive examples from terrestrial noise
management and other sectors, it is concluded that such measures offer
the most promising long-term solution to deliver existing and future
policy commitments to manage cumulative levels of underwater noise
pollution.

N2  - Objective Establishing what leads people to particular moral beliefs is
complicated by potential predictors being themselves caused by moral
attitudes. This problem is less acute when considering the effects of
good looks, which, by expanding sexual opportunities, shift incentives
for beliefs regarding the morality of sexual activities. Methods
Regressions predict responses to morality-related questions in the 2016
General Social Survey and the 1972 National Election Study, which
included interviewer (i.e., not self-generated) evaluations of
respondents' looks. These questions concern various actions' moral
acceptability regardless of legality, as well as policy positions on
issues including gay marriage and marijuana legalization. Results
Better-looking respondents give more morally permissive responses to
most questions relating to sex. For issues not directly related to
sexual opportunities, however, attractiveness does not predict
significantly more acceptant attitudes. Conclusion Good-looking people
generally are more acceptant of those indulgences that they have
disproportionate opportunities for, highlighting the role of opportunism
in the formation of moral and political attitudes.

N2  - The EU Broiler Directive came into force in the UK in June 2010 with the
aim of setting new minimum standards, monitoring broiler welfare and
addressing any welfare problems. A survey questionnaire was used to
elicit information from a stratified sample of citizens in England and
Wales regarding their willingness to pay for the provisions of the
Directive, as an estimate of the consumer surplus associated with the
legislation. We also explore the usefulness of Prelec's () Bayesian
Truth Serum (BTS) in promoting respondents' truthful reporting. A median
willingness to pay of 21.50 pound per household per year (corrected for
sample bias and possible `yea saying') was estimated from 665 responses.
This provides an estimated benefit of the legislation to citizens of
over 503 pound million per year, equivalent to 5.3% of current consumer
expenditure on chicken. This compares to an estimated 22 pound million
per year cost of producers' compliance and government enforcement
associated with the legislation. No statistically significant
differences in responses between respondents that did and did not have a
BTS incentive to answer questions truthfully were found, which might
reflect apparently truthful answers in this case, an insufficiently
strong financial incentive or a weakened effect due to an element of
disbelief in the BTS amongst the sample. The analysis suggests that the
benefits of the Broiler Directive to citizens greatly outweigh the
additional costs to producers, making a case for the legislation to be
retained.

N2  - This study analyses the linkages between private forest owners'
perceptions of forest management, and their affinity for subsidies, in a
range of European countries. Society increasingly requires the provision
of ecosystem services from forests, but the willingness of forest owners
to redirect management goals from wood production to the provision of
public goods is crucial for sustaining ecosystem services. EU incentives
in the forestry sector are still mainly oriented towards an
anthropocentric vision of forest management. Forest owners and managers
are diverse, and although many efforts have been made to understand the
role of forest subsidies in private forest management, it is still
necessary to analyse the different perspectives on forest subsidies with
a regional comparative approach. This paper explores European private
forest owners' affinity for subsidies - through survey data at European
level-and estimates an ordered probit model to (i) analyse how private
forest owners in Europe respond to subsidies in forestry, including
regional differences in terms of affinity for subsidies, (ii)
characterize the factors that influence these responses and (iii)
discuss lessons learned related to forest owners' attitudes on subsidies
and the implications for introducing similar kind of incentives such as
payments for ecosystem services. Simulations were conducted to examine
the potential effects of changes in property fragmentation or the time
allotted to forest activities. Forest owners with an utilitarian view of
forest management, bigger forest holdings, full or part-time farmers and
forest owners from East Europe are most in favour of forest subsidies.
Property fragmentation and absenteeism decreases affinity for subsidies.

N2  - Background: Understanding and addressing the needs of frail patients has
been identified as an important strategy by the Nova Scotia Health
Authority (NSHA). Primary care (PC) providers are in a key position to
aid in the identification of, and response to frailty as part of routine
care. Unlike singular chronic conditions such as diabetes and
hypertension which garner a disease-based approach and identification as
part of standard practice, frailty is only just emerging as a concept
for PC. The web-based Frailty Portal was developed to aid in the
identification of, assessment and care planning for frail patients in PC
practice. In this study we assess the implementation feasibility and
impact of the Frailty Portal by: (1) identifying factors influencing the
Frailty Portal's use in community PC practice, and (2) examination of
the immediate impact of the `Frailty Portal' on frail patients, their
caregivers and PC providers.
Methods: A convergent mixed method approach was implemented among PC
providers in community-based practice in the NSHA, Central Zone.
Quantitative and qualitative data were collected concurrently over a
9-month period. A sample of patients who underwent assessment and/or
their caregiver were approached for survey participation.
Results: Fourteen community PC providers (10 family physicians, 4 nurse
practitioners) completed 48 patient assessments and completed or begun
41 care plans; semi-structured interviews were conducted among 9
providers. Nine patients and 5 caregivers participated in the survey. PC
providers viewed frailty as an important concept but implementation
challenges were met, primarily with respect to the time required for use
and lack of fit with traditional practice routines. Additional barriers
included tool usability and accessibility, training and care planning
steps, and privacy. Impacts of the tools use with respect to confidence
and knowledge showed early promise.
Conclusion: This feasibility study highlights the need for added health
system supports, resources and financial incentives for successful
implementation of the Frailty Portal in community PC practice. We
suggest future implementation integrate the Frailty Portal to practice
electronic medical records (EMRs) and target providers with largely
geriatric practice populations and those practicing within
interdisciplinary, collaborative primary healthcare (PHC) teams.

N2  - For decades, Florida residents have lost billions of dollars in property
damage because of wind and wind-driven rainwater intrusion from tropical
cyclones. Engineers and scientists have demonstrated that future losses
can be reduced significantly with practical resilience-enhancing
mitigation measures. The role of policy makers therefore is to design
successful strategies that will result in the adoption of approved
mitigation measures by homeowners. The rational design and delivery of
vulnerability information and mitigation options are a critical part of
such programs. Confronting and overcoming the significant upfront costs
of mitigation with novel financing mechanisms is essential as well. To
maximize the use of constrained funding allocated for resilience
policies, this paper explores the effectiveness of vulnerability
information and financial assistance programs to facilitate mitigation
using online survey responses from households across Florida. The survey
is designed to test preferences for low- and high-cost roofing and
opening protection measures to reduce hurricane-related damages in the
context of information and incentive treatments. Empirical analysis
indicates that financial incentives are preferred to vulnerability
information to foster mitigation.

N2  - Purpose Referral reward programs (RRPs) incentivize existing customers
(inductors) to refer new customers (inductees). The effectiveness of
RRPs is not well understood as previous studies either focused on
referral intent and/or ignored inductee responses. However, an RRP is
only effective if inductors recommend and inductees respond with buying
the service. The purpose of this paper is to examine the drivers of
existing customers' successful referral behavior.
Design/methodology/approach This study combines a bank's customer
relationship management (CRM) data which were used to identify
successful inductors and non-inductors. Then, observed behavioral and
customer background data from the CRM database (including successful
referrals, deposits in euros, number of products held, relationship
duration, income, age, and gender) were combined with survey data
capturing attitudinal variables (i.e. perceived relationship quality,
reward attractiveness, referral metaperception, opportunism, and
involvement). This approach allowed for the simultaneous testing of all
hypothesized drivers of successful referral behavior. Findings
Metaperception (i.e. the process by which individuals determine the
impressions other might form of them and their behavior) was the
strongest and most significant driver of successful RRP participation,
followed by attractiveness of the reward. That is, inductors recommended
successfully when they believed that their incentivized referral did not
look bad (or even looked good) and incentives were perceived as
attractive. This finding is important as metaperception so far has only
been examined in theoretical and experimental studies with intent as
dependent variables. Second, latent class analysis (LCA) revealed that
there were two segments of inductors of which one was opportunistic.
Opportunism as a driver of referral behavior has not been shown in past
research using more traditional analyses, whereas LCA uncovered it as a
driver for one-third of all respondents.
Practical implications - The findings offer managers a better
understanding of the key determinants of successful referral behavior
with important RRP design implications that counter frequent practice
(e.g. designing RRPs with high face value but then reducing its
usefulness through terms and conditions). Furthermore, managers may
consider segment-specific reward structures to improve the effectiveness
of their RRPs.
Originality/value - This study is the first to examine inductor
determinants of successful referral behavior and identify inductor
segments.

N2  - To combat the potentially detrimental effects of nonresponse, most
surveys repeatedly followup with nonrespondents, often targeting a
response rate or predetermined number of completes. Each additional
recruitment attempt generally brings in a new wave of data, but returns
gradually diminish over the course of a static data collection protocol.
Consequently, (nonresponse-adjusted) point estimates calculated from the
accumulating data begin to stabilize. This is the notion of phase
capacity, suggesting some form of design change is warranted, such as
switching modes, increasing the incentive, or simply discontinuing
nonrespondent follow-up.Phase capacity testing methods that have
appeared in the literature to date are generally only applicable to a
single point estimate. It is unclear how to proceed if conflicting
results are obtained following independent tests on two or more point
estimates. The purpose of this paper is to introduce two multivariate
phase capacity tests, one referred to as the Wald chi-square method and
another referred to as the non-zero trajectory method. Both methods are
designed to provide a universal, yes-or-no phase capacity determination
for a battery of point estimates. The two competing methods' performance
is compared via simulation and application using data from the 2011
Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey. All else equal, the Wald chi-square
method is found to detect phase capacity sooner than the non-zero
trajectory method.

N2  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to review the current status of
certification and certified hotels on the African continent, and to
discuss the implications for mainstreaming sustainable tourism on the
continent.
Design/methodology/approach - The research design focused on a
literature review and an online survey. The survey was used to consult
stakeholders on options for incentives, and future interventions, which
was distributed to 80 stakeholders from the government, certification
bodies, intergovernmental agencies and NGOs. The survey resulted in 41
complete responses from 18 countries.
Findings - The study identified nine African certification programs, and
nine international certification programs operating in Africa.
Collectively, the African and international certification programs have
certified at least 715 accommodation facilities in 19 African countries,
against their environmental, social and economic criteria. So only a
very small proportion of all hotels in Africa have been certified
(certainly less than 3.4 per cent) and that these are patchily
distributed across the continent. A number of incentives have been used
in Africa, including marketing and promotion; interest free loans for
new technologies; preferential inclusion in tour itineraries; free or
discounted application processes; and technical support. Consultees
suggested that hotels were generally motivated to seek certification to:
promote their achievements to environmentally conscious clients and
avoid negative criticism, and save money by conserving resources.
However, hotels do not understand the financial benefits of sustainable
practices.
Research limitations/implications - Research limitations include the
modest sample size. For the purposes of this research, there was a
greater emphasis in targeting a modest number of key respondents who
could provide expert opinions on the topic, rather than a more extensive
sample size of lower quality.
Practical implications - Practical implications include recommendations
of incentives and approaches to mainstream tourism certification in
Africa. These include promoting programmes and their returns on
investment more broadly, promoting market advantage for certified
accommodation (i.e. preferential marketing or concession terms) and the
value of integrating sustainability criteria into national and regional
quality-rating standards.
Originality/value - This is the first study of its kind to analyse
certification on the African continent, which was presented at the
Climate Change Summit (COP22) in Morocco in 2016 and the BEST EN Think
Tank XVII in June 2017.

N2  - Objective. To characterize use of the Pharmacy Curriculum Outcomes
Assessment (PCOA) in terms of timing, manner of delivery, and
application of the results by accredited colleges of pharmacy.
Methods. Accredited pharmacy programs were surveyed regarding PCOA
administration, perceived benefits, and practical application of score
reports. Survey items were comprised of new items developed from a
literature review and items from prior studies. The survey addressed
five domains: program demographics, administration, student preparation,
use of results, and recommendations to improve the utility of the PCOA.
Results. Responses were received from 126 of 139 (91%) surveyed
programs. The majority of respondent programs administered PCOA in one
session on a single campus. Most indicated PCOA results had limited use
for individual student assessment. Almost half reported that results
were or could be useful in curriculum review and benchmarking.
Considerable variability existed in the preparation and incentives for
PCOA performance. Differences in some results were found based on prior
PCOA experience and between new vs older programs. Open-ended responses
provided suggestions to enhance the application and utility of PCOA.
Conclusion. The intended uses of PCOA results, such as for student
assessment, curricular review, and programmatic benchmarking, are not
being implemented across the academy. Streamlining examination
logistics, providing additional examination-related data, and clarifying
the purpose of the examination to faculty members and students may
increase the utility of PCOA results.

N2  - Objectives As healthcare decision makers continue to face challenges in
health services delivery to their patients, disinvestment programs are
being established for a sustainable healthcare system. This study aimed
to collect data and information by means of a survey of disinvestment
candidates and ongoing disinvestment projects in the health technology
assessment (HTA) community. Methods An online survey was conducted to
collect information on disinvestment candidates and activities from
members of the Health Technology Assessment International Disinvestment
& Early Awareness Interest Group, the EuroScan International Network
and International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment.
Results Among the 362 invitees, twenty-four unique responses were
received, and almost 70 percent were involved in disinvestment
initiatives. The disinvestment candidates identified represented a range
of health technologies. Evidence or signaling of clinical
ineffectiveness or inappropriate use typically led to the nomination of
disinvestment candidates. Health technology assessments and
reassessments were usually conducted to evaluate the technology in
question, and decisions usually led to the limited use of the
technology. Barriers to disinvestment decisions included the strength of
interest and advocacy groups, insufficient data for assessments, a
systematic decision process and political challenges, while obstacles to
their implementation were clinicians' reluctance and insufficient
funding and incentives. Conclusions The survey results suggested that
disinvestment activities are occurring in the HTA community, especially
in the public sector. Future research can further investigate the
processes and methods used to reach and implement disinvestment
decisions from our survey respondents and explore to form closer ties
between the HTA and clinical communities.

N2  - IMPORTANCE Offers of payment for research participation are ubiquitous
but may lead prospective participants to deceive about eligibility,
jeopardizing study integrity and participant protection. To date,
neither the rate of payment-induced deception nor the influence of
payment amount has been systematically studied in a nationally
representative randomized survey experiment.
OBJECTIVES To estimate payment-associated deception about eligibility
for an online survey and to assess whether there is an association
between payment amount and deception frequency.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized, 7-group survey experiment.
Data were collected in March 2018 and analyzed from March to August
2018. The setting was a nationally representative online survey among US
adults drawn from the GfK KnowledgePanel.
INTERVENTIONS Varying payment amounts for participation ($5, $10, or
$20 cash equivalent) and direction of eligibility criterion (having
received or not having received an influenza vaccination in the past 6
months).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Proportion of respondents reporting recent
influenza vaccination.
RESULTS In total, 2275 individuals participated in the survey, a
59.4%(2275 of 3829) response rate; 51.8%(1108) were female, and 21.1%
of respondents (399) were aged 18 to 29 years, 24.9%(532) were aged 30
to 44 years, 26.0%(601) were aged 45 to 59 years, and 28.0%(738) were
60 years or older. For participants offered a $5 incentive, the
reported frequency of recent influenza vaccination was 16.6% higher
(95% CI, 9.1%-24.1%) among those told that eligibility (and thus
payment) required recent vaccination than among those told that
eligibility required no recent vaccination. The corresponding
differences were 21.0%(95% CI, 13.5%-28.5%) among those offered $10
and 15.4% (95% CI, 7.8%-23.0%) among those offered $20. Estimated
proportions of ineligible individuals who responded deceptively
regarding eligibility ranged from 10.5% to 22.8% across study groups.
There was no evidence that higher payment was associated with higher
frequency of deception.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In a nationally representative randomized
survey experiment to evaluate whether and to what extent payment is
associated with participants misleading investigators about their
research eligibility, this study found evidence of significant
deception. However, no association was observed between payment amount
and frequency of deception. Further research is needed to extend these
findings to clinical research. These data suggest that, when possible,
investigators should rely on objective tests of eligibility rather than
self-report.

N2  - The increasing share of renewable energies in electricity generation is
within the scope of the energy transition and will lead to a more
volatile generation of electricity. A more flexible energy demand could
contribute to handling the resulting challenges in electricity grid
management. The service sector is one of the target groups for utilizing
flexible demand, also called demand response (DR). Supermarkets, hotels,
and office buildings can be found in regions throughout Germany. This
could be an advantage regarding the compensation of grid instability in
any region, compared to more locally focused industrial enterprises.
First estimations point out considerable unused DR potentials for the
service sector. However, currently, there is less knowledge about
flexibility options in the service sector than in industry. Moreover,
market barriers, such as a missing adequate regulatory framework
offering attractive incentives prevent that the potentials are tapped.
Therefore, in this paper, we first analyze survey data from 1.000
enterprises of the service sector in Germany to identify subsectors that
have a high share of flexible cross-sectoral technologies in electricity
consumption. Data indicates that the subsectors trade, restaurants, and
hotels as well as office-like buildings are the most promising
subsectors of the service sector regarding demand response potential,
since they have a high stock in flexible cooling appliances, air
conditioning, and ventilation. In a second step, we conducted
stakeholder interviews, to find specific barriers, drivers, and possible
starting points in each of the identified subsectors. Still unapt or
missing regulatory framework conditions, low profitability, and a lack
of knowledge regarding flexibility potentials and marketing mechanisms
seem to be the main barriers. However, framework conditions promoting
demand response measures are improving, e.g., technical standards and
latest regulatory revisions. This indicates that in order to tap the
existing demand response potentials in the service sector, the value of
flexibility in demand needs to be appreciated, e.g., by facilitating
market participation or by creating offers resp. rewarding the
enterprises' flexibility of demand. In addition, addressing demand
response issues in already existing policy measures, such as energy
audits could raise awareness and knowledge.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Journal clubs exist in a variety of forms in medical schools
across the United States. Many incorporate a full spectrum of medical
specialties, some are specific to certain interest groups or
specialties, and many widely vary in whether or not they are school
mandated or student-run. While these clubs are ubiquitously scattered
throughout medical education, there has been very little quantitative or
qualitative analysis regarding the efficacy of these clubs in enhancing
medical students' abilities to evaluate clinical literature. The purpose
of this study was to evaluate the effects of attending Surgical Journal
Club meetings at Eastern Virginia Medical School from both a qualitative
and quantitative perspective. The authors' hypothesis was that regular
attendance of these sessions would improve student performance from a
multitude of perspectives and demonstrate the value of clinical
literature analysis earlier in medical education.
METHODS: A fifteen question Likert survey was administered on an
optional basis to thirty-six medical students attending journal club.
Responses were analyzed anonymously, and there was no incentive or
demerit for completing the survey. Data was compiled and the mean,
median, and mode for each question calculated with ``5{''} corresponding
to ``Strongly Agree{''} and ``1{''} corresponding to ``Strongly
Disagree.{''}
RESULTS: Twenty-seven of thirty-six attendees to our seventh journal
club meeting completed the survey. Student responses were overwhelming
positive, with all but one question reaching above ``Agree{''} by
analysis of the mean responses.
CONCLUSION: Journal clubs remain an integral part of medical education
but their importance has been diminished in recent years due to the
increasing demands of other aspects of the first two years in medical
school. We described a medical student run/established journal club that
increased students' interest in surgery, their perceived knowledge-base,
and comfort in critically analyzing medical journal articles. ((C) 2018

N2  - Background: In 2011, Israel instituted financial incentives as part of a
larger program to attract doctors to residency programs in peripheral
hospitals.
Objective: To explore the impact of these incentives and related changes
on the choices of locations for residency training in Israel.
Methods: We performed (A) an analysis of administrative data on the
location of all new medical residencies in 2005-2014 (B) an
internet/phone survey of residents who began specialty training in
2013-2014, with a response rate of 71%.
Results: (A) Of all entrants to residency training programs in Israel,
those in peripheral hospitals constituted 16-20% in 2005-2010, 19% in
2011, 23% in 2012, and 23% in 2013; the increase consisted
predominantly of physicians who were graduates of non-Israeli medical
schools (B) About half of all residents in the periphery reported that
the incentives contributed to their choice of residency location. About
40% of that group also reported that they had planned already in
medical school to practice in the periphery, while 60% of that group
(30% of all residents in the periphery) did not have such plans prior
to medical school. About 70% of the residents in peripheral hospitals
grew up in the periphery; for the southern periphery this was 40% and
for the northern periphery this was 80%.
Conclusions: The changes instituted in 2011 apparently affected
residency location preferences for a non-negligible proportion of young
physicians, particularly among those who grew up in the periphery.
Policymakers should consider combining targeted incentives with measures
to increase the supply of physicians who grew up in the periphery. (C)

N2  - Changing individual's recycling attitude and behaviour is of utmost
importance in achieving sustainable construction and demolition (C&D)
waste management, yet it has often been underachieved. To understand the
motivations for recycling, this study identifies and prioritizes the key
factors that affect C&D waste recycling behaviour of various
stakeholders in Hong Kong (i.e., representatives from
construction-waste-related organizations, environmental consultants and
contractors, and government engineers) in a quantitative manner using
statistical tools. Different from traditional C&D waste behavioural
determinants studies, this paper utilizes an integrated analytical
method through semi structured interviews and survey questionnaire on
the basis of Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). Qualitative thematic
analysis and quantitative frequency analysis were performed to analyse
responses from semi-structured interviews and questionnaires, followed
by correlation analysis to quantify the relationships between factors.
Results indicated that four key factors: (i) regulatory compliance, (ii)
economic incentives, (iii) accreditation scheme, and (iv) logistics and
management incentives directly influenced recycling behaviour of
individuals. Regulatory compliance was the most determining factor for
consultants, contractors, experts, and government officials, whereas
economic incentives were of great concern to the public. Under the
factor of economic incentives, strong positive relationships were
identified between disposal costs and collection and sorting costs, thus
increasing waste disposal charging fee may promote recycling behaviour.
In comparison, accreditation scheme deserved better recognition to
facilitate a closed-loop material flow in the construction industry.
These findings help to devise more effective and stakeholder-oriented
policy tools to raise awareness and encourage behavioural change towards
C&D waste recycling, and assist policy makers to establish regulations
and practices for sustainable resource management. (C) 2018 Elsevier

N2  - In recent years, the government and community have focused extensive
attention on food waste recycling to achieve sustainable waste
management. However, the motivation of stakeholders from the commercial
and industrial sector to change recycling behaviour has not received
enough attention. This study aimed to identify, prioritise, and quantify
the relationships between key latent variables that affect the food
waste recycling behaviour of relevant industries in Hong Kong (i.e.
representatives from the hotel, food and beverages, and property
management industries). This study integrated semi-structured interviews
and a survey questionnaire on the basis of the Theory of Planned
Behaviour, setting it apart from conventional studies on food waste
behavioural factors. Qualitative content analysis and quantitative
structural equation modelling were performed to analyse the interview
and questionnaire responses, followed by correlation analysis to
quantify the relationships between variables. The results demonstrate
that food waste recycling behaviour is determined by three latent
variables-administrative incentives and corporate support, logistics and
management incentives, and economic incentives. Administrative
incentives and corporate support demonstrate significant effects on
recycling behaviour. Moral attitudes show a strong positive correlation
with administrative incentives and corporate support. Similarly, there
is a significant positive correlation between moral attitudes and
logistics and management incentives. Administrative incentives and
corporate support is the determining variable for the hotel and food and
beverages industries, whereas logistics and management incentives are of
the highest concern to property management representatives. These
findings can facilitate the development of stakeholder-oriented policy
to encourage corporate behavioural change towards food waste recycling
for sustainable resource circulation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

accidents and incidents. Recognizing that safety does not occur in a
vacuum, this study also focuses on other system approaches that have
been implemented to address safety hazards. These approaches include
various technology applications, infrastructure modifications, and other
programs and initiatives, such as driver incentive programs and close
call/near miss reporting. The research team conducted a literature
review; performed a survey of selected transit agencies; and identified
and conducted detailed case studies of I I public transit agencies,
selected from the survey respondents based on their responses to the
survey. Effective safety management is comprehensive and multifocused in
nature. At the case study agencies, safety management methods are often
undertaken concurrently or within a period that does not provide
agencies the ability to establish, with certainty, that one method or
strategy contributed more to improved safety versus another. Successful
programs examined in the case studies have been effective because of
multifaceted, coordinated efforts to address transit safety. Strategies
such as increased or modified operator training, technology
applications, infrastructure modifications, and safety campaigns and
promotions were often implemented simultaneously. Thus, judging the
relative success of one strategy in reducing transit incidents when
multiple strategies were implemented concurrently was difficult. Case
study participants agreed that the progress toward a mature safety
management system (SMS) framework within their agencies would contribute
to an overall reduction in transit safety risks.

N2  - During the last 40 years, China has undergone rapid urbanization which
has resulted in land degradation and a decrease in land. Cultivated land
protection has thus become one of the most active and important aspects
of land science. This study presents a pressure-response-impact (PRI)
framework which may reveal the inter-correlations among households'
land-use behavior and cultivated land quality change in the process of
rapid urbanization in China. The structural equation model (SEM) has
been applied using a household survey dataset collected in 2015 in
Sujiatun district, Shenyang city, Liaoning province. The results show
that: (1) there is a complex causal relationship between the latent
variables urbanization, household land-use behavior and cultivated land
quality (i.e., urbanization land-use behavior land quality), which
supports our PRI conceptual framework; (2) the changes of external
social-economic context stemming from urbanization are the major cause
of land-use behavior variance; (3) land quality is mostly affected by
farmers' land-use behavior including land-use pattern, land-use degree
and land-input intensity, in particular the growing of cash crops (GCC,
associated with land use pattern) and capital input per unit of farmland
(LII, associated with land input intensity). These findings are of some
theoretical and practical significance. Theoretically, they add to the
current literature by identifying the roles of sociological factors and
farmers' land-use behavior in the process of land quality protection
using a PRI framework. Practically, measures should be taken to
reasonably set the prices of agricultural products, promote the
development of the land rental market and increase the comparative
revenue of agricultural production, so as to stimulate incentives to
farming and land quality protection.

N2  - Construction professionals are prone to work-family conflict and job
burnout, which in turn can affect project performance during
implementation of delivery. To cope with this, a questionnaire survey
was undertaken with construction professionals in the Chinese
construction industry and 373 valid responses were received. A
theoretical model introducing organizational support as a moderating
variable was developed and tested with structural equation modeling. The
results showed that there is a positive correlation between work-family
conflict and job burnout for construction professionals. Involving
organizational support can alleviate the impact of work-family conflict
on professionals' job burnout. Meanwhile, both work-family conflict and
job burnout have negative effects on project performance. Therefore, an
atmosphere and culture of humanized management should be established
within the construction enterprises. Additionally, organizational
incentives such as regulations and rules should be formulated assisting
employees achieve work-family balance. Such incentives could contribute
to the construction industry and improve project performance.
Furthermore, this study provides a new theoretical perspective for the
management of job burnout and work-family conflict in the construction
industry, complementing the existing body of knowledge.

N2  - Introduction: Financial incentives can support smoking cessation, yet
low acceptability may limit the wider implementation of such schemes.
Few studies have examined how smokers view financial-incentive
interventions aimed at reducing smoking prevalence.
Methods: We recruited a sample of 623 smokers from an internet panel to
a survey assessing support for, and perceived effectiveness of,
financial incentives for smoking cessation. We used descriptive
statistics, plus logistic regression, to test associations between
demographics and smoking, and support. We used qualitative content
analysis to analyze open-ended responses to a question that invited
respondents to comment on financial incentives.
Results: Financial incentives were supported by 38.4% of smokers;
42.2% did not support and 19.4% had no opinion. Support was higher
among heavy (OR = 3.96, 95% CI = 2.39 to 6.58) and moderate smokers (OR
= 1.68, 95% CI = 1.13 to 2.49), and those with a recent quit attempt
(OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.04 to 2.07). Support was strongly associated
with perceived effectiveness. A Government-funded reward-only scheme was
seen as the most acceptable option (preferred by 26.6% of
participants), followed by a Government-funded deposit-based scheme
(20.6%); few respondents supported employer-funded schemes. Open-ended
responses (n = 301) indicated three overarching themes expressing
opposition to financial incentives: smokers' individual responsibility
for quitting, concerns about abuse of an incentive scheme, and concerns
about unfairness.
Conclusion: Even amongst those who would benefit from schemes designed
to reward smokers for quitting, support for such schemes is muted,
despite the evidence of their effectiveness. Media advocacy and health
education could be used to increase the understanding of, and support
for, financial incentives for smoking cessation.

N2  - Background. Transplant societies continue to actively concentrate on
increasing rates of living kidney donation (LKD) to bridge the gap
between individuals awaiting transplantation and the number of kidneys
available. A widely discussed strategy to increase living donation rates
is the provision of incentives and removal of disincentives. Though
opinions of the public regarding this strategy have been studied, the
opinions of health care providers, including younger professionals, are
less clear. We studied the opinions of medical students and other health
care providers on strategies to increase LKD to determine if opinions
were different among those < 25 or >= 25 years of age.
Methods. A simple cross-sectional survey was conducted at an academic
medical center. Participants included medical students and employees in
Internal Medicine, General Surgery, and the Organ Transplantation
Center. Pearson's chi(2) and Fisher's exact test were conducted on the
responses regarding disincentives and incentives to determine whether
opinions differed based on age.
Results. Six hundred and twenty-four participants completed the survey.
There was no statistical difference in opinions between groups on
reimbursing transportation costs, loss of wages, or childcare costs, but
those aged >= 25 were more agreeable with covering food/lodging costs
compared to those < 25 (96.5% vs 90.7%, P = .009). Respondents < 25
years old were more willing to donate a kidney for a financial incentive
(P = .0002) accepting a median amount of $25,000.
Conclusions. Health care personnel broadly support removing financial
disincentives for living kidney donation, and those >= 25 were more in
favor of covering food/lodging costs compared to those < 25. Those < 25
years old were more likely to accept financial incentives towards
donating their kidney compared to those >= 25 years.

N2  - In recent years, numerous studies have been conducted to evaluate the
demand for acquiring electric vehicles (EVs) by household with little
attention given to the commercial fleet sector. Within the latter,
rental vehicles account for the majority of fleets in Canada.
Eventually, the acquisition of rental vehicles by their respective
companies is driven by consumers' demand for these vehicles in the
market. This research provides a pioneering effort to evaluate Canadian
consumers' preferences towards renting EVs. A nationwide stated
preference (SP) survey was conducted to collect information from over
1000 respondents. Each respondent was presented with six choice
scenarios, and each scenario featured the following vehicle powertrains:
internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV), hybrid electric vehicle
(HEV), plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) and battery electric
vehicle (BEV). The collected SP responses, along with socio-demo-graphic
and attitudinal characteristics of the respondents, were analyzed using
a latent class discrete choice model to identify the potential segments
with unique features present in the sample population. The model
identified the following four distinct latent classes: ICEV-oriented
(22%), EV-curious (34%), Cost-sensitive (24%), and EV-oriented
(20%). Based on the empirical analysis, the potential for renting
electric vehicles among the EV-curious and the EV-oriented classes could
increase with improvements in vehicle driving range and battery
recharging time. Further, provision of monetary incentives (e.g., free
vehicle upgrades, rental discounts and no rental taxes) could also
increase the probability of renting HEVs by the Cost-sensitive
consumers.

N2  - This study investigates how the ecosystem services (ES) linked to
livestock grazing are perceived across countries. A total of 82 case
studies collected from 42 countries via survey (53.7% cases from Europe
and 46.3% from outside of Europe) have been analysed through a
multivariate approach. In all, 18 non-provisioning ES were considered.
Overall, the reported impacts of livestock grazing on the different ES
were much more positive than negative. Notably, a large proportion of
respondents reported either positive or very positive impacts for some
cultural ES, namely cultural, historic and natural heritage (84%),
knowledge systems and educational values (77%), landscape values
(74%), and for some supporting and regulating ES, namely habitat
provision (66%), nutrient cycling (65%), and bush encroachment/fire
control (66%). Based on multiple regression analysis, geographic
origin, stakeholder type and species category, as well as protection
status of the grazing area, had significant effects on the perception of
the impacts. Respondents reported those impacts as more positive in
Europe, in protected areas and where several species were present in the
grazing area. A significantly larger proportion of respondents reported
recognition of ES provided by the grazing livestock population in
European countries (40.9%) compared with non-European countries
(23.7%). Based on the survey responses it appears that in non-European
countries absence of formal recognition, especially by policy makers, is
a major challenge for the continued provision of ES in grazing systems.
In Europe, where such recognition is already often included in
legislation, the long-term sustainability of related policies and
incentives to provide such services is viewed as a major issue by the
respondents.

N2  - Background: Workplace aggression is a major work health and safety, and
public health concern. To date, there has been limited investigation of
population level exposure and responses to workplace aggression from all
sources, and little evidence on the experiences, reporting and
support-seeking behaviour of nurses, midwives and care personnel in
Australian settings.
Aim: To determine the 12-month prevalence of aggression experienced by
nurses, midwives and care personnel from sources external and internal
to the organisation, and the reporting behaviours and support sought
from employers, health services, Trade Unions, work health and safety
agencies, police and legal services.
Methods: An online survey of the membership of the Australian Nursing
and Midwifery Federation Victorian Branch was conducted between 1 st May
and 30th June 2017.
Findings: In the previous 12 months, 96.5% of respondents experienced
workplace aggression, with 90.9% experiencing aggression from external
sources and 72.3% from internal sources. A majority indicated they just
accepted incidents of aggression, and most rarely or never took time off
work, sought medical or psychological treatment, or sought
organisational or other institutional support, advice or action. Levels
of satisfaction with institutional services were mostly neutral to poor.
Discussion: Victorian nurses, midwives and care personnel work in
aggressive and violent workplaces. The incivility endemic in health care
likely sets the climate for the generation of and exposure to so much
explicit aggression and violence. It appears that any systems or
processes instituted to protect health care personnel from harm are
failing.
Conclusion: More targeted and effectively operationalised legislation,
incentives and penalties are likely required. Further research may
elaborate the extent of the impact of exposure to workplace aggression
over time. (C) 2018 Australian College of Nursing Ltd. Published by

N2  - Objectives: Available published advice on use of incentives is limited
and generally refers to short-term studies without longer follow-up,
predominantly conducted in developed countries. We aim to summarize
published information related to the use of incentives in long-term
nutrition studies involving infants, children, and adolescents and the
views of researchers in the field, to provide guidance on acceptable
incentives. We conducted a literature review and a short online survey
of researchers regarding their opinions on the use of incentives in
paediatric long-term (follow-up) clinical studies. Responses from 38
researchers from 14 different countries indicated that 41% had used
incentives to increase participation and 29% to 73%, depending on
child's age and type of procedure, thought incentives may be used to
increase compliance with follow-up visits. A small number of respondents
thought incentives would not be approved by national ethics boards.
Based on the literature review and the survey results, and European
Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition
working group concluded that incentives for children and adolescents up
to the value of 30 Euros, based on average EU income levels, may be
offered as cash, vouchers, or age-appropriate gifts or toys, in addition
to reimbursing expenses. Additional incentives may be offered if a study
includes more burdening procedures, techniques that may appear
frightening for younger children, or requires sustained participation
(eg, dietary diaries or activity monitoring). There was agreement that
it is preferable to give toys or gifts rather than money to younger
children.

N2  - The objective of this study was to assess monetary and non-monetary
factors that can influence the decision to participate in a future
health survey. A questionnaire was administered to eligible, low-income
participants (n=1502) of the 2012 Los Angeles County Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (LAHANES-II). Multivariable regression
analyses were performed to describe factors potentially associated with
future intent to participate in similar survey designs. The results of
the survey suggest that, overall, female participants had a greater
interest in participating under a variety of incentive scenarios.
Compared to the 25-34 age group, older participants (35-44, 45-84)
reported more interest to participate if $10 cash {[}prepaid gift/debit
card], a coupon for product/travel, or a small item {[}e.g., granola
bar, t-shirt, pen] was offered, whereas younger participants (18-24)
reported greater interest for $25 cash or a coupon for product/travel.
Non-Whites, when compared to Whites/Non-Hispanics, reported greater
interest to participate if any of the incentives was offered. High
school graduates, when compared to those with some college education,
reported greater interest to participate if $10 cash, a small item, or
a lottery ticket was offered. Presence of two or more chronic conditions
increased interest while concerns about participation in LAHANES-II was
associated with reduced interest to participate in future health-related
surveys. The results suggest that both incentives and non-monetary
considerations (e.g., personal concerns about participating and
individual level characteristics) can influence the decision to
participate in health-related surveys and offer insights into strategies
that can improve response rates for these assessments that are often
used to inform community planning.

N2  - This study presents results from an investigation into the effect of
positive incentives on cycling behaviour among 1802 commuters in the
Twente region of the Netherlands. The authors used an on-line survey,
which included mock-up apps with incentives to commute to work by
bicycle. They tested five reward schemes, namely social rewards (such as
badges), in-kind gifts, money, competition, and cooperation. They used
the survey data in a multinomial logit model to estimate to what extent
travellers will use the app and increase their cycling frequency and
which incentives they prefer. The model results show that respondents
who sometimes cycle to work are more positive about incentive schemes
than respondents who never cycle and that offering an app with in-kind
gifts is probably most effective. Interestingly, non-cyclists are more
likely to change their behaviour for a reward if they care about travel
costs, while occasional cyclists are more likely to cycle more often in
response to incentives if they care about attributes that are related to
the cycling itself. This also depends on attitudes towards cycling and
on socio-demographic variables.

VL  - 13

DO  - 10.1371/journal.pone.0208121
N2  - Background
Climate change and extreme temperatures pose increasing challenges to
individuals and their health with older adults being one of the most
vulnerable groups. The aim of this paper is to better understand the
roles that tangible assets (e.g., physical or financial) and intangible
assets (e.g., human or social) play in the way older adults adapt to
extreme temperatures, the types of adaptive responses they implement,
limits and constraints, as well opportunities for better adaptation.
Rather than focusing exclusively on extremes of heat, or considering
each type of asset in isolation, the important and novel contribution of
this paper is to take an integrated and multi-seasonal qualitative and
quantitative approach, that conjointly investigates all categories of
assets in relation to the adaptations that independently-living older
adults make to both extreme heat and extreme cold.
Methods and findings
The paper examines the contribution of assets to adaptation to extreme
temperatures among older adults living independently in their homes. An
innovative mixed methods study with an inter-seasonal approach was
implemented in Lisbon, Portugal with interviews and surveys during
summer for extreme heat and winter for extreme cold. The ability of
participants to adapt to extreme temperatures was found to be dependent
on asset context and diversity, and the dynamics through which extreme
temperatures enhanced or reduced the stock of assets available. As a
result, participants engaged in activities of assets replacement,
exchange or substitutions. Despite this, many participants recognised
many constraints and limits to their ability to adapt and protect their
health and well-being ranging from reduced income, high energy costs and
lack of social networks. Opportunities for improving older adults'
adaptation were found to exist and strategies, action and investment
have been identified by older adults which included life-long education,
incentives to improve insulation and local activities.
Conclusions
The paper suggests that the implementation of the proposed asset-based
approach linking assets and adaptation to extreme temperatures,
illustrates the key pathway that individuals, their families and carers,
governments, policymakers, researchers and practitioners can follow to
ensure effective adaptation and promote health and well-being.
Supporting older adults' adaptation to extreme temperatures is possible
and can be complemented with efforts to reduce older adults'
vulnerability and building resilience to extreme temperatures. These
findings pose concrete implications for policy and practice, including
for example the need for implementation of measures and actions to
reduce poverty, reduce energy costs, improve the quality of the housing
stock and improve older adults' social networks.

N2  - The impact of payment-for-performance (P4P) schemes in the health sector
has been documented, but there has been little attention to the
distributional effects of P4P across health facilities. We examined the
distribution of P4P payouts over time and assessed whether increased
service coverage due to P4P differed across facilities in Tanzania. We
used two service outcomes that improved due to P4P {[}facility-based
deliveries and provision of antimalarials during antenatal care (ANC)],
to also assess whether incentive design matters for performance
inequalities. We used data from 150 facilities from intervention and
comparison areas in January 2012 and 13 months later. Our primary data
were gathered through facility survey and household survey, while data
on performance payouts were obtained from the programme administrator.
Descriptive inequality measures were used to examine the distribution of
payouts across facility subgroups. Difference-in-differences regression
analyses were used to identify P4P differential effects on the two
service coverage outcomes across facility subgroups. We found that
performance payouts were initially higher among higher-level facilities
(hospitals and health centres) compared with dispensaries, among
facilities with more medical commodities and among facilities serving
wealthier populations, but these inequalities declined over time. P4P
had greater effects on coverage of institutional deliveries among
facilities with low baseline performance, serving middle wealth
populations and located in rural areas. P4P effects on antimalarials
provision during ANC was similar across facilities. Performance
inequalities were influenced by the design of incentives and a range of
facility characteristics; however, the nature of the service being
targeted is also likely to have affected provider response. Further
research is needed to examine in more detail the effects of incentive
design on outcomes and researchers should be encouraged to report on
design aspects in their evaluations of P4P and systematically monitor
and report subgroup effects across providers.

N2  - Deforestation associated with agricultural expansion, particularly that
of extensive cattle ranching, remains a pressing challenge for
sustainable development and climate mitigation efforts in South America.
In response to these challenges, national and local governments, as well
as private and non-governmental actors, have developed new forest
conservation governance mechanisms. In addition to reducing
deforestation for agricultural expansion, it is hoped that these
policies may lead to the intensification of existing agricultural
regions, thereby contributing to global food availability and continued
rural development. The objective of this study is to understand the
timing and spatial patterns of crop and pasture intensification in
agriculture-forest frontiers in the context of changing conservation
policies and rural development. We focus on Mato Grosso, the largest soy
and cattle producing state in Brazil, which spans the Cerrado and Amazon
biomes and has experienced among the highest levels of deforestation for
agricultural expansion globally. Using econometric analysis of remotely
sensed and agricultural survey data, we find that cropland and pasture
intensification are both linked to increasing forest conservation
restrictions and broader supply chain development. However, the effect
of conservation restrictions on intensification is lower in regions
where there is more forest remaining. While crop and pasture area
dynamics are often coupled in agriculture-forest frontiers, crop
intensification does not appear to have contributed to pasture
intensification through animal feed production. Intensification of crop
and pasture areas was associated with temporary, immediate reductions in
local deforestation, but crop intensification was associated with
increased deforestation over longer time periods. These results suggest
that targeted investments in supply chain infrastructure in the Amazon
frontier could promote intensification and relieve pressure to clear
forests, but must be coupled with substantial, long-term negative
incentives for deforestation, including more effective public forest
governance and private zero-deforestation commitments.

N2  - We evaluate three farmer behavioral responses to incentive payments for
ecosystem services, specifically a cover crop cost-share program aimed
at reducing nitrogen loads in the Chesapeake Bay. Using farmer survey
data in Maryland, we estimate a two-stage simultaneous equation model to
correct for voluntary enrollment. Econometric model results are
integrated with the Chesapeake Bay Program watershed model to estimate
nitrogen abatement for the Bay and associated abatement costs. Estimated
additionality for nitrogen abatement is 97% for enrolled farmers when
only the direct treatment effect on cover crops is taken into account,
but reductions in vegetative cover (slippage) and indirect effects on
conservation tillage are consequential. Slippage is particularly large
among farmers not currently enrolled in the program, indicating that
loss of vegetative cover may substantially offset pollution abatement if
cost sharing is extended to this group. These findings suggest that
unenrolled farmers may not be a low-cost source of pollution abatement
as is often assumed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - The quantity of spruce-fir forest and some conifer-associated breeding
bird abundances in the Atlantic Northern Forest have declined in recent
decades emphasizing the need to better understand avian responses to
forest management and to identify options that proactively conserve
habitat for birds during the breeding and post-breeding period. We
conducted avian point counts and vegetation surveys on publicly and
privately-owned lands with known management histories to assess
relationships between avian assemblages in harvest and post-harvest
treatments that could provide habitat for passerine birds associated
with the spruce-fir forest type. We sampled regenerating
conifer-dominated stands 5-41 years-since-harvest (YSH) in three harvest
treatments (selection, irregular first-stage shelterwood, and clearcuts)
and three postharvest treatments including regenerating clearcuts
treated with aerially applied herbicide (e.g., glyphosate),
precommercial thinning (PCT), both herbicide and PCT, and mature stands
(>= 48 YSH). Spruce-fir obligate and associate birds were more abundant
in stands with greater spruce-fir tree composition (>= 70% and >= 60%,
respectively). Avian richness of spruce-fir obligates, associates, and
species of concern was greater in clearcuts and clearcuts with
post-harvest treatments. Vegetative features associated with greater
richness and abundance of spruce-fir birds, such as greater spruce-fir
composition and smaller tree diameter at breast height, were prominent
in regenerating clearcuts and post-harvest treatments and suggested that
these management practices promote local abundances and richness of
spruce-fir birds. Richness and abundances of spruce-fir birds were least
in selection, shelterwood, and mature stands, and vegetative features
associated with greater richness and abundance of spruce-fir birds were
diminished in these stands. Forestry trends in Maine indicate that the
extent of the clearcut suite of treatments has decreased on the
landscape while selection and shelterwood harvests have increased. Thus,
changes in incentives for managers to apply even-aged management coupled
with postharvest applications of herbicides or precommercial thinning
might mitigate further declines in habitat for spruce-fir passerines
assemblages. A greater ratio of clearcuts with postharvest treatments
11-40 YSH compared to other treatments (mature forest >= 48 YSH,
selection and shelterwood 5-41 YSH) would maintain diverse spruce-fir
bird communities on the landscape. Use of clearcuts with post-harvest
treatments in the hemiboreal forests of northern New England, southern
Quebec, and Maritime Provinces of eastern Canada may enhance habitat for
breeding and post-breeding spruce-fir birds, especially where the
quantity of conifer forests are declining and residual patches of
conifers are increasingly fragmented.

N2  - Purpose: The opioid epidemic in the United States is an ongoing public
health concern. Health care institutions use standardized patient
satisfaction surveys to assess the patient experience and some offer
incentives to their providers based on the results. We hypothesized that
providers who report being incentivized based on patient satisfaction
surveys are more likely to report an impact of such surveys on their
opioid prescribing practices.
Methods: We developed a 23-item survey instrument to assess the
self-perceived impact of patient satisfaction surveys on opioid
prescribing practices in primary care and the potential impact of
institutional incentives. The survey was emailed to all 1404 members of
the Colorado Academy of Family Physicians.
Results: The response rate to the online survey was 10.4% (n = 146).
Clinical indications for which responders prescribe opioids included
acute pain (93%), cancer pain (85%), and chronic nonmalignant pain
(72%). Among physicians using patient satisfaction surveys,
incentivized physicians reported at least a slight impact on opioid
prescribing 3 times more often than physicians who were not incentivized
(36% vs 12%, P = .004).
Conclusions: Efforts to improve patient satisfaction may have
potentially untoward effects on providers' opioid prescribing behaviors.
Our results suggest a need to further study the impact of provider
incentive plans that are based on patient satisfaction scores.

N2  - We study the design of incentive contracts based on customer
satisfaction (CS) surveys with reward budget limits. We extend
principal-agent models to consider budget constraints, survey response
rates, and correlation between CS measure and demand. We derive the
optimal incentive contract and study the impacts of these factors on
contract performance. In contrast to the common belief that customer
future values are the drivers of CS incentives, we show that CS
incentives can benefit principals even in a single-period setting where
customers bring no future value. Improvements can be achieved without
increasing total reward, because the CS incentive program reveals
additional information about agents' service effort and diversifies
their risk. Such effects are overlooked in existing CS research. With
consideration of correlation between sales and CS measures, we provide a
metrics selection rule regarding which reward(s)-CS, sales commission,
or both should be included in an incentive plan. We also study
cumulative incentive schemes based on commonly used average CS measures
and show that such incentive schemes may fail to motivate agents to
increase service effort. Therefore, designing proper reward schemes is a
critical issue for effective CS management and deserves future research.

outcome measure included in the U.S. Medicare End Stage Renal Disease
Quality Incentive Program. Administered twice yearly, it assesses
in-center dialysis experience and survey responses are tied to dialysis
facility payments. Low response rates, currently approximately 35%,
raise concern for possible underrepresentation of patient groups.
Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of survey administration in 2012 to
all in-center hemodialysis patients in Dialysis Clinic, Inc. (DCI)
facilities nationally over 18 years old who received hemodialysis at
their facility for at least 3 months. Patient-level covariates included
demographic, clinical, laboratory, and functional characteristics.
Random effects multivariable logistic regression was used to assess
survey non-response.
Results: Among 11,055 eligible patients 6541 (59%) were non-responders.
Of the remaining 4514 responders, 549 (14%) surveys were not usable due
to presence of proxy help or incomplete responses. Non-responders were
more likely to be men, non-white, younger, single, dual
Medicare/Medicaid eligible, less educated, non-English speaking, and not
active on the transplant list; non-responders had longer ESRD vintage,
lower body mass index, lower serum albumin, worse functional status, and
more hospitalizations, missed treatments, and shortened treatments.
Similar associations were found using more parsimonious multivariable
analyses and after imputing missing data.
Conclusions: Non-responders to the ICH CAHPS significantly differed from
responders, broadly spanning individuals with fewer socioeconomic
advantages and greater illness burden, raising limitations in
interpreting facility survey results. Future research should assess
reasons for non-response to improve ICH CAHPS generalizability and
utility.

N2  - Background: Survey researchers use monetary incentives as a strategy to
motivate physicians' survey participation. Experiments from general
population surveys demonstrate that prepaid incentives increase response
rates and lower survey administration costs relative to postpaid
incentives. Experiments comparing these two incentive strategies have
rarely been attempted with physician samples.
Methods: A nationally representative sample of oncologists was recruited
to participate in the National Survey of Precision Medicine in Cancer
Treatment. To determine the optimal strategy for survey incentives,
sample members were randomly assigned to receive a $50 prepaid
incentive check or a $50 promised (postpaid) incentive check. Outcome
measures for this incentives experiment include cooperation rates, speed
of response, check-cashing behavior, and comparison of hypothetical
costs for different incentive strategies.
Results: Cooperation rates were considerably higher for sample members
in the prepaid condition (41%) than in the postpaid condition (29%).
Similar differences in cooperation rates were seen for physicians when
stratified by region, size of the physician's metropolitan statistical
area, specialty, and gender by age. Survey responders in the prepaid
condition responded earlier in the field period than those in the
postpaid condition, thus requiring fewer contacts. In the prepaid group,
84% of sample members who responded with a completed survey cashed the
incentive check and only 6% of nonresponders cashed the check. In the
postpaid condition, 72% of survey responders cashed the check;
nonresponders were not given a check. The relatively higher cooperation
rates and earlier response of the responders in the prepaid condition
was associated with a 30% cost savings for the prepaid condition
compared to the postpaid incentive condition.
Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that the rewards of
offering physicians a prepaid incentive check outweigh the possible
risks of nonresponders cashing the check. The relative cost benefit of
this strategy is likely to vary depending on the amount of the incentive
relative to the costs of additional contact attempts to nonresponders.

N2  - Background: Mobile Technology and Incentives (MOTIVES) is a randomized
pilot study of a mobile technology-based and behavioral
economics-supported HIV prevention intervention. Behavioral economics
(BE) uses financial incentives in a way that departs from the
traditional focus on large monetary payments. Instead, BE suggests that
relatively small ``nudges{''} can effectively initiate and sustain
behavior change. This pilot study examines the feasibility and
acceptability of an HIV prevention intervention that uses text messages
in combination with BE incentives to improve retention of HIV prevention
information and increase frequency of HIV testing among Latino/a men who
have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW). The pilot will also
estimate mission-critical design parameters with point and confidence
interval estimates of the intervention to inform a future, fully powered
effectiveness study.
Methods: The project will be conducted in collaboration with Bienestar
Human Services, Inc. (Bienestar), a non-profit community-based service
organization. The intervention is being tested in a small, randomized
controlled trial to pilot the intervention's feasibility and
acceptability among 200 Latino/a MSM and TGW from Bienestar's HIV
testing sites. Information on feasibility will include recruitment,
refusal, and retention rates as well as message sending success rates;
acceptability will include perceived appropriateness based on responses
to the intervention. Participants will be randomized into either the
``information only{''} control group (e.g. receiving text messages with
HIV prevention information) or the ``information plus{''} intervention
group (e.g. additionally receiving quiz questions that provide the
possibility of winning prizes). Participants will be followed for 12
months from enrollment. In addition to using data abstracted from
Bienestar's routine data collection mechanisms, we will also collect
survey data (blinded outcome assessment) from participants at 0, 6, and
12 months to provide an initial assessment of whether incentives affect
their level of HIV knowledge and testing frequency.
Discussion: If shown to be acceptable, feasible, and resource-efficient,
MOTIVES will provide an innovative way to communicate the latest HIV
prevention information and support trimestral HIV screening among
Latino/a MSM and TGW.

N2  - Compliance with the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) in the United States
will require price incentives for a substantial number of motorists with
flex-fuel vehicles to switch to high ethanol-gasoline blends. Existing
estimates of motorists' willingness to pay for high-ethanol blends use
data from Brazil, data generated when prices greatly favored low-ethanol
blends, or stated preference data collected from mail and online
surveys. We conducted an intercept survey of flex motorists as they
refueled in five U.S. states. We overcome the problem caused by sample
prices favoring low-ethanol blends by augmenting revealed preference
data with stated preference data. A sample-selection problem arises
because motorists with high willingness to pay seek out the relatively
few stations that sell high-ethanol blends. We use responses from two
questions to inform sample selection. We find the average U.S. motorist
requires a substantial discount to switch to high ethanol blends beyond
the price that equates the cost per mile of driving.

N2  - Standard corrections for missing data rely on the strong and generally
untestable assumption of missing at random. Heckman-type selection
models relax this assumption, but have been criticized because they
typically require a selection variable which predicts non-response but
not the outcome of interest, and can impose bivariate normality. In this
paper we illustrate an application using a copula methodology which does
not rely on bivariate normality. We implement this approach in data on
HIV testing at a demographic surveillance site in rural South Africa
which are affected by non-response. Randomized incentives are the ideal
selection variable, particularly when implemented ex ante to deal with
potential missing data. However, elements of survey design may also
provide a credible method of correcting for non-response bias ex post.
For example, although not explicitly randomized, allocation of food gift
vouchers during our survey was plausibly exogenous and substantially
raised participation, as did effective survey interviewers. Based on
models with receipt of a voucher and interviewer identity as selection
variables, our results imply that 37% of women in the population under
study are HIV positive, compared to imputation-based estimates of 28%.
For men, confidence intervals are too wide to reject the absence of
non-response bias. Consistent results obtained when comparing different
selection variables and error structures strengthen these conclusions.
Our application illustrates the feasibility of the selection model
approach when combined with survey metadata. (C) 2018 The Authors.

N2  - The recruitment is an integral part of most research projects in medical
sciences involving human participants. In health promotion research,
there is increasing work on the impact of environments. Settings
represent environments such as schools where social, physical and
psychological development unfolds. In this study, we investigated weight
gain in students within a university setting. Barriers to access and
recruitment of university students within a specific setting, in the
context of health research are discussed. An online survey on health
behaviours of first year students across 101 universities in England was
developed. Ethics committees of each institutions were contacted to
obtain permission to recruit and access their students. Recruitment
adverts were standardized and distributed within restrictions imposed by
universities. Three time points and incentives were used. Several
challenges in recruiting from a university setting were found. These
included (i) ethics approval, (ii) recruitment approval, (iii)
navigating restrictions on advertisement and (iv) logistics of varying
university academic calendars. We also faced challenges of online
surveys including low recruitment, retention and low eligibility of
respondents. From the 101 universities, 28 allowed dissemination of
adverts. We obtained 1026 responses at T1, 599 at T2 and 497 at T3. The
complete-case sample represented 13% of those originally recruited at
T1. Conducting research on students within the university setting is a
time consuming and challenging task. To improve research-based health
promotion, universities could work together to increase consistency as
to their policies on student recruitment.

N2  - Background: An estimated 50% of adolescents and young adults (AYA)
living with HIV are failing to adhere to prescribed antiretroviral
treatment (ART). Digital games are effective in chronic disease
management; however, research on gaming to improve ART adherence among
AYA is limited.
Objective: We assessed the feasibility and acceptability of video gaming
to improve AYA ART adherence.
Methods: Focus group discussions and surveys were administered to health
care providers and AYA aged 13 to 24 years living with HIV at a
pediatric HIV program in Washington, DC. During focus group discussions,
AYA viewed demonstrations of 3 game prototypes linked to portable
Wisepill medication dispensers. Content analysis strategies and thematic
coding were used to identify adherence themes and gaming acceptance and
feasibility. Likert scale and descriptive statistics were used to
summarize response frequencies.
Results: Providers (n=10) identified common adherence barriers and
strategies, including use of gaming analogies to improve AYA ART
adherence. Providers supported exploration of digital gaming as an
adherence intervention. In 6 focus group discussions, 12 AYA
participants identified disclosure of HIV status and irregular daily
schedules as major barriers to ART and use of alarms and pillboxes as
reminders. Most AYA were very or somewhat likely to use the demonstrated
game prototypes to help with ART adherence and desired challenging,
individually tailored, user-friendly games with in-game incentives. Game
prototypes were modified accordingly.
Conclusions: AYA and their providers supported the use of digital games
for ART adherence support. Individualization and in-game incentives were
preferable and informed the design of an interactive technology-based
adherence intervention among AYA living with HIV.

N2  - We report results of an experiment designed to assess whether the
payment of contingent incentives to respondents in Karnataka, India,
impacts the quality of survey data. Of 2276 households sampled at the
city block level, 934 were randomly assigned to receive a small one-time
payment at the time of the survey, whereas the remaining households did
not receive this incentive. We analyse the effects of incentives across
a range of questions that are common in survey research in less
developed countries. Our study suggests that incentives reduced unit
non-response. Conditionally on participation, we also find little impact
of incentives on a broad range of sociodemographic, behavioural and
attitudinal questions. In contrast, we consistently find that households
that received incentives reported substantially lower consumption and
income levels and fewer assets. Given random assignment and very high
response rates, the most plausible interpretation of this finding is
that incentivizing respondents in this setting may increase their
motivation to present themselves as more needy, whether to justify the
current payment or to increase the chance of receiving resources in the
future. Therefore, despite early indications that contingent incentives
may raise response rates, the net effect on data quality must be
carefully considered.

N2  - Introduction
Online surveys are a valuable tool for social science research, but the
perceived anonymity provided by online administration may lead to
problematic behaviors from study participants. Particularly, if a study
offers incentives, some participants may attempt to enroll multiple
times. We propose a method to identify clusters of non-independent
enrollments in a web-based study, motivated by an analysis of survey
data which tests the effectiveness of an online skin-cancer risk
reduction program.
Methods
To identify groups of enrollments, we used a hierarchical clustering
algorithm based on the Euclidean distance matrix formed by participant
responses to a series of Likert-type eligibility questions. We then
systematically identified clusters that are unusual in terms of both
size and similarity, by repeatedly simulating datasets from the
empirical distribution of responses under the assumption of independent
enrollments. By performing the clustering algorithm on the simulated
datasets, we determined the distribution of cluster size and similarity
under independence, which is then used to identify groups of outliers in
the observed data. Next, we assessed 12 other quality indicators,
including previously proposed and study-specific measures. We summarized
the quality measures by cluster membership, and compared the cluster
groupings to those found when using the quality indicators with latent
class modeling.
Results and conclusions
When we excluded the clustered enrollments and/or lower-quality latent
classes from the analysis of study outcomes, the estimates of the
intervention effect were larger. This demonstrates how including repeat
or low quality participants can introduce bias into a web-based study.
As much as is possible, web-based surveys should be designed to verify
participant quality. Our method can be used to verify survey quality and
identify problematic groups of enrollments when necessary.

N2  - In response to concerns about rapid climate change and air pollution,
electric vehicles (EVs) have been diffusing rapidly in some countries
since the early 2010s. Many researchers have investigated the value
attributes affecting consumers' attitudes to and behaviors around EVs.
Little effort has been made, however, to identify the interacting
factors in the relationship between perceived value and adoption. To
fill this research gap, we examine the moderating effects of
environmental traits and government supports on adoption intention.
Using survey data collected from 285 drivers in Korea, we identify the
significant impacts of perceived value as a predictor of consumers'
intention to adopt EVs. Operational economic benefit and charging risk
are revealed as the main motivators of and barriers to EV diffusion,
respectively. We also find that environmental concern and financial
incentives significantly enhance the effects of perceived value on
adoption intention. The implications of these findings for the success
of EV market diffusion are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

response to their volunteer work within the broader context of their
livelihoods in Madagascar. A cross-sectional survey of 874 CHWs, called
Agents de Sante Communautaire (ACs), from 14 districts across 5 regions
was conducted in June 2015. Only 44% of ACs had cash savings.
Subsistence farming was the main livelihood strategy; ninety-two percent
of ACs were food insecure and 89% had experienced a shock in the past
year. Overall, 77% of ACs financed commodity resupply through sales of
health products and 18% from their personal savings; stock-outs at
point of supply and financial and time constraints were the main
reported challenges in getting health products. The average satisfaction
score with AC work was 3 out of 4. This assessment from Madagascar helps
unveil a more comprehensive view of the reality of CHWs' lives. Managers
need to take into account the potential implications of the demands of
CHW work on already precarious livelihoods.

response (DR). This article takes the political commitment to DR as a
starting point and empirically examines Finnish stakeholders' views on
barriers to the utilization of DR and the ways in which these barriers
could be overcome. The analysis is based on surveys of Finnish
electricity retailers and distribution system operators (DSOs), a survey
of a wider range of energy specialists, and a follow-up workshop of the
latter survey. According to the participants, the main barriers are
related to customer engagement and DR automation. Thus, the proposed
solutions focused largely on end-user incentives and obligations as well
as technical issues. Especially the latter topic would benefit from
regulative measures such as standardization of appliance interfaces,
whereas changes in electricity tariff structures may take place either
through normative changes by the retailers and DSOs or through
regulation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background and objectives
Practice-based research (PBR) is of pivotal importance for hospital
pharmacists which not only up-grades the profession but also improves
the patient care. This study aimed to evaluate the attitude, perception,
willingness, motivation and barriers to PBR among hospital pharmacists
in Pakistan.
Methods
A descriptive, cross sectional study design was employed. Data were
collected between 1st December, 2017 and 1st March, 2018 from 130
hospital pharmacists employed in 41 hospitals of Lahore, Pakistan. A
survey instrument comprising of six sections was designed to determine
the attitude, perception, willingness, motivation and barriers to PBR.
Data were analyzed by using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (IBM
SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 21.0, Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). The
normality of the data was determined through Shapiro-Wilks and
Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. Independent Samples Mann-Whitney U Test and
Independent Samples Kruskal-Wallis Test were carried out to test if
there were differences among the characteristics of the hospital
pharmacists. Logistic regression analysis was used to figure out the
factors associated with attitude, perceptions, willingness and
motivation towards PBR. A p-value <0.05 was used for statistical
significance of differences.
Results
A total of 141 pharmacists were approached. Among them, 130 responded to
the survey (response rate 92%). Out of a maximum score i.e., 5 (100%)
the respondents obtained a median score of 4 (IQR = 0) for attitude,
perception and motivation towards PBR; whereas, a median score of 4 (IQR
= 1) was obtained for willingness thus demonstrating fair positive
attitude, good perceptions, increased motivation and willingness towards
PBR. The most common barrier limiting the pharmacists' participation in
PBR was lack of time (23.8%) followed by lack of incentives (16.2%)
and lack of support (14.6%). Results of the logistic regression
analysis revealed that hospital pharmacists practicing in the inpatient
settings had 4.56 times more positive attitude towards PBR (OR = 4.56,
95% CI = 1.07 - 19.42, p-value = 0.040) as compared to those practicing
in the outpatient settings. The male hospital pharmacists (OR = 8.86,
95% CI = 1.15-53.74, p-value = 0.017), those practicing in the
outpatient (OR = 23.51, 95% CI = 2.04-271.53, p-value = 0.011) and
inpatient settings had increased motivation towards PBR (OR = 12.24,
95% CI = 1.61-94.66, p-value = 0.016).
Conclusion
Despite the presence of several barriers, the respondents had fair
positive attitude, good perceptions, increased motivation and
willingness towards PBR which is a promising finding.

N2  - This study empirically investigates the relationship between two key
supplier performance measurement and management practices (i.e.
monitoring and incentives) and suppliers' operational performance.
Grounding on agency theory, a theoretical framework is proposed
identifying the mediation effect of goal congruence and supplier
opportunism within the direct relationship between monitoring/incentives
and suppliers' operational performance. Related hypotheses are tested by
applying structural equation modelling on a final sample of 305
responses, collected from a cross-country survey. Results uncover a
nuanced and insightful picture: both monitoring and incentives
positively affect the suppliers' operational performance. Goal
congruence does not result as a significant mediator whereas supplier
opportunism mediates the monitoring-performance relationship and the
incentives-performance relationship. However, contrary to expectations,
providing incentives to suppliers increases the chances of opportunistic
behaviours, which in turn diminishes suppliers' operational performance.
While the key empirical evidence supports the general positive impact of
monitoring and incentives on performance, incentives appear as a
double-edged sword due to their potential counterproductive effect in
increasing supplier opportunism.

N2  - Objective: To assess United States pediatricians' attitudes, beliefs,
and perceived professional injunctive norms regarding spanking. Method:
A self-administered questionnaire was mailed to a nationwide random
sample of 1500 pediatricians in the US, drawn from a database maintained
by IMS Health. Four survey mailings were conducted and cash incentives
of up to $20 were provided. The response rate was 53% (N = 787).
Results: Most respondents were members of the American Academy of
Pediatrics (85%), had been practicing physicians for 15 years or more
(66%), and were white (69%) and female (59%). All US regions were
represented. About 3-quarters of pediatricians did not support the use
of spanking, and most perceived that their colleagues did not support
its use either. Pediatricians who were male, black, and/or sometimes
spanked as children had more positive attitudes toward spanking and
expected more positive outcomes from spanking than their counterparts.
Nearly 80% of pediatricians never or seldom expected positive outcomes
from spanking, and a majority (64%) expected negative outcomes some of
the time. Conclusion: The majority of pediatricians in the US do not
support the use of spanking with children and are aware of the empirical
evidence linking spanking with increased risk of poor health outcomes
for children. Pediatricians are a key, trusted professional source in
advising parents about child discipline. These findings suggest that
most pediatricians will discourage the use of spanking with children,
which over time could reduce its use and associated harms in the
population. This is of clinical relevance because, despite strong and
consistent evidence of the harms that spanking raises for children,
spanking is still broadly accepted and practiced in the US

laboratory experiments to analyze whether elicitation format, survey
design and framing, and follow-up questions can generate truthful
responses. For public goods, we adapt the existing WTP incentive
compatibility theoretical framework to the WTA context and test the
theory using an experiment involving voting. Results are consistent with
the WTP literature and suggest that WTA values can be valid as long as
responses have consequences for respondents. For the private good
experiment, we focus on whether respondents are motivated to affect the
price or the provision of the good. We find that strategic behavior is
present and in the direction expected by theory. Survey framing and the
use of follow-up questions can provide bounds on the value estimates.
These findings raise potential concerns with the use of non-incentive
compatible elicitation mechanisms in WTA contexts. (C) 2018 Elsevier

N2  - BACKGROUND: Recruiting and retaining community-based pediatricians for
teaching medical students has been explored through the lens of
preceptors and educational leaders. The purpose of this study was to
explore the perspective of pediatric department chairs, a key
stakeholder group charged with maintaining teaching capacity among a
faculty.
METHODS: In 2015, members of the Association of Medical School Pediatric
Department Chairs and Council on Medical Student Education in Pediatrics
joint task force disseminated a 20-item survey to pediatric department
chairs in the United States and Canada. Topics included demographics,
incentives offered to community pediatricians, and the perceived value
and feasibility of such incentives. Data were analyzed using descriptive
statistics and (2) to compare categorical variables.
RESULTS: Pediatric department chairs from 92 of 145 (63% response rate)
medical schools returned the survey. Sixty-seven percent reported
difficulty recruiting or retaining preceptors, and 51% reported
high-reliance on preceptors for the ambulatory portion of the pediatrics
clerkship. Almost all (92%) cited competition from other programs for
the services of community preceptors. The provision of incentives was
correlated with perceived feasibility (R-2 = 0.65) but not their
perceived value (R-2 = 0.12). Few (21%) chairs reported providing
financial compensation to preceptors. The provision of compensation was
not related to reliance but did vary significantly by geographical
region (P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric departments rely heavily on community-based
pediatricians but face competition from internal and external training
programs. The perspective of department chairs is valuable in weighing
interventions to cfacilitate continued recruitment and retention of
community preceptors.

N2  - Surveys tend to yield low response rates among human service
professionals. This study examined whether a randomly-assigned prepaid
$2 incentive increased response rates over time, and was cost-effective
for increasing response count, among social workers and volunteer
mediators. The incentive was enclosed with a mixed-mode survey of
factors related to burnout and intention-to-remain. The incentive
increased response rates over time. The effect of the incentive did not
differ between mediators and social workers. The $2 incentive was not
cost-effective for increasing response count. Implications are discussed
for reducing nonresponse bias, decreasing time-to-response, and
considering response rate versus response count.

N2  - Background: Physician rating websites (PRWs) allow patients to rate,
comment and discuss physicians' quality online as a source of
information for others searching for a physician. It is generally
assumed that PRWs will only be helpful for users, and fair for the
rated, if there are a high number of ratings. However, the number of
ratings on PRWs remains low internationally and there is currently a
lack of research examining the reasons why patients are not rating their
physicians. The aim of this study is to therefore identify the spectrum
of factors influencing people's willingness to rate their physician on
PRWs.
Methods: A mailed cross-sectional survey sent to a random sample from 4
North German cities between April and July 2016. Fifty participants who
had previously used PRWs but not rated a physician provided reasons for
why that had not rated a physician in a free text response.
Semi-structured qualitative telephone interviews were then conducted
with 22 interested participants to explore factors influencing their
willingness to rate their physician on PRWs in more detail.
Results: Participants identified a total of 21 distinct incentives and
disincentives for rating physicians on PRWs, which could be further
categorised under the headings: user-specific, PRW-specific and
physician-specific. Two key overarching groups of factors emerged: (1)
factors concerning the physician-patient relationship, and (2) factors
issues regarding technical aspects of PRWs.
Conclusion: These findings will be helpful in guiding future research
and health policy initiatives to increase the usefulness and fairness of
PRWs.

N2  - Physician questionnaires are commonly used in health services research;
however, many survey studies are limited by low response rate. We
describe the effectiveness of a method to maximize survey response
without using incentives, the effectiveness of survey reminders over
time, and differences in response rates based on survey mode and primary
care specialty. As part of a study to assess vaccine policy issues, 13
separate surveys were conducted by internet and mail over the period of
2008 to 2013. Surveys were conducted among pre-recruited networks of
pediatricians, family physicians and general internists. Each network
was active for 2 years and responded to 3-6 surveys. Physicians who
indicated preference to respond through an online survey received up to
9 e-mailed requests to complete the questionnaire and up to 2 mailed
questionnaires. Physicians who chose to respond by mail received up to 3
mailed questionnaires and a reminder postcard. For 6 of the 13 surveys
conducted over the 6 year period, an additional mailing using a
hand-addressed envelope was mailed to non-responders at the end of the
usual protocol. Effectiveness of survey methods was measured by response
rates. The overall response rates varied from 66-83%. Response rates
declined 17 percentage-points on average between the first and last
surveys administered within each physician network. The internet group
consistently had higher response rates than the mail group (74% vs.
62% on average). An additional mailing in a hand-written envelope
boosted the final response rate by 11 percentage-points. Self-selection
of survey mode, multiple reminders, and hand-written envelopes are
effective methods for maximizing response rates in physician surveys.

N2  - We examine a range of options for recruiting teachers into a nationally
representative survey panel. Recruitment strategies considered include a
telephone-based approach and the use of promised incentives and
pre-incentives of varying amounts and forms. Using a randomized
experiment, we evaluate the effectiveness of five separate recruitment
strategies and conduct a cost-benefit analysis. Our preferred strategy
is one that uses a US$10 gift card as pre-incentive (it yielded a 27%
rate of successful recruitment a cost of US$78 per recruited teacher).
Statistical comparisons indicate that no other technique was superior to
this strategy in terms of recruitment rate or cost-effectiveness.
Efforts at refusal conversion after the initial approach were mostly
ineffective. A comparison across demographic type characteristics of
enrolled panelists and nonrespondents shows no substantial differences
for any recruitment strategy considered. Hence, the potential for
recruitment-level nonresponse to induce large bias into findings from
surveys administered to the panel is minimal.

N2  - Background: Financial rewards have been shown to be an important
motivator to include normal healthy volunteers in trials. Less emphasis
has been put on non-healthy volunteers. No previous study has
investigated the impact of a voucher incentive for participants in a
cross-sectional study in a clinical setting. The objective of this study
was to examine the impact of a small voucher incentive on a survey
response rate in a clinical setting at the point-of-care in a
quasi-randomized controlled trial (q-RCT).
Methods: This was an ancillary study to a survey of patients subsequent
to their appointment with a physician investigating physician-patient
communication. We randomized participants to receive or not receive a
voucher for a coffee (costs: 1 (sic)) enclosed in the survey package.
Alternation of groups was performed on a weekly basis. The exact
Chi-square test was used to compare response rates between study arms.
Results: In total, 472 participants received the survey package. Among
them, 249 participants were quasi-randomized to the voucher arm and 223
to the control group. The total response rate was 46%. The response
rates were 48% in the voucher arm and 44% in the control group. The
corresponding risk ratio was 1.09 (95% CI: 0.89, 132).
Conclusions: A small voucher incentive to increase the response rate in
a survey investigating physician-patient communication was unlikely to
have an impact. It can be speculated whether the magnitude of the
voucher was too low to generate an impact. This should be further
investigated in future real-world studies.

N2  - Introduction Since 2001, the Health Resources and Services
Administration's Maternal and Child Health Bureau (HRSA MCHB) has funded
and directed the National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) and the
National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs (NS-CSHCN),
unique sources of national and state-level data on child health and
health care. Between 2012 and 2015, HRSA MCHB redesigned the surveys,
combining content into a single survey, and shifting from a periodic
interviewer-assisted telephone survey to an annual self-administered
web/paper-based survey utilizing an address-based sampling frame.
Methods The U.S. Census Bureau fielded the redesigned NSCH using a
random sample of addresses drawn from the Census Master Address File,
supplemented with a unique administrative flag to identify households
most likely to include children. Data were collected June 2016-February
2017 using a multi-mode design, encouraging web-based responses while
allowing for paper mail-in responses. A parent/caregiver knowledgeable
about the child's health completed an age-appropriate questionnaire.
Experiments on incentives, branding, and contact strategies were
conducted. Results Data were released in September 2017. The final
sample size was 50,212 children; the overall weighted response rate was
40.7%. Comparison of 2016 estimates to those from previous survey
iterations are not appropriate due to sampling and mode changes.
Discussion The NSCH remains an invaluable data source for key measures
of child health and attendant health care system, family, and community
factors. The redesigned survey extended the utility of this resource
while seeking a balance between previous strengths and innovations now
possible.

N2  - Background: Despite having many advantages, online eHealth trials are
not without challenges-notably, participant recruitment, and outcome
data retention. Moreover, publications from these trials rarely provide
detailed information on the methods used for recruitment and retention
or discuss implications of the methods for future studies.
Objective: To address this need for empirical guidance regarding
recruitment and outcome data retention planning, we aim to describe the
methods and lessons learned from the recruitment and retention
procedures used in a large randomized trial of 2 Web-based smoking
cessation interventions.
Methods: To ensure a demographically and geographically diverse
participant sample, we used the recruitment strategies (1) traditional,
(2) Web-based, and (3) online survey panel methods and adaptively
modified each in response to recruitment success. At baseline,
participants indicated how they heard about the study and answered
demographic questions. To maximize trial retention at each of the 3-,
6-, and 12-month assessment points, 4 survey modalities (first Web,
followed by phone, mail, and postcard) were sequentially timed over a
30-day period. Participants received US $25 for submitting their
responses, regardless of modality, and received an additional US $10
bonus for completing the Web survey within 24h of electronic
notification.
Results: We randomized 2637 smokers in 16 months and achieved 88%
retention at 12-months. Participants (79.26% female, 72.60% Caucasian)
were recruited from all 50 states. The majority of participants were
recruited through Facebook (49.43%), followed by the survey panel
(20.85%), free internet sources (14.54%), traditional media (11.34%),
and Google ads (3.84%). Descriptively, participant demographics varied
by recruitment source. Of the completed follow-up surveys, most were
completed by Web (92%). Retention rates did not vary by recruitment
source.
Conclusions: Continuous monitoring and refinement of multiple
recruitment methods, particularly of online advertising campaigns,
allowed us to maximize the effectiveness of recruitment strategies in
recruiting a large, diverse sample of smokers. Likewise, offering
multiple follow-up survey modalities in sequential order along with
time-dependent bonus incentives enabled us to obtain outcome data from a
very high level of enrolled participants for the duration of the trial
protocol. These strategies may be similarly useful in other trials.

N2  - Michigan's approach to Medicaid expansion, the Healthy Michigan Plan
(HMP), emphasizes primary care, prevention, and incentives for patients
and primary care practitioners (PCPs).
Assess PCPs' perspectives about the impact of HMP on their patients and
practices.
In 2014-2015, we conducted semi-structured interviews then a statewide
survey of PCPs.
Interviewees came from varied types of practices in five Michigan
regions selected for racial/ethnic diversity and a mix of rural and
urban settings. Surveys were sent via mail.
Interviewees were physician (n = 16) and non-physician practitioners (n
= 3). All Michigan PCPs caring for ae<yen> 12 HMP enrollees were
surveyed (response rate 55.5%, N = 2104).
PCPs' experiences with HMP patients and recent changes in their
practices.
Interviews include examples of the impact of Medicaid expansion on
patients and practices. A majority of surveyed PCPs reported recent
increases in new patients (52.3%) and patients who had not seen a PCP
in many years (56.2%). For previously uninsured patients, PCPs reported
positive impact on control of chronic conditions (74.4%), early
detection of serious illness (71.1%), medication adherence (69.1%),
health behaviors (56.5%), emotional well-being (57.0%), and the
ability to work, attend school, or live independently (41.5%). HMP
patients reportedly still had more difficulty than privately insured
patients accessing some services. Most PCPs reported that their
practices had, in the past year, hired clinicians (53.2%) and/or staff
(57.5%); 15.4% had colocated mental health care. Few (15.8%) reported
established patients' access to urgent appointments worsened.
PCP reports of patient experiences may not be accurate. Results reflect
the experiences of PCPs with ae<yen> 12 Medicaid patients. Differences
between respondents and non-respondents present the possibility for
response bias.
PCPs reported improved patient access to care, medication adherence,
chronic condition management, and detection of serious illness.
Established patients' access did not diminish, perhaps due to reported
practice changes.

N2  - Background: The US is in the midst of one of the largest public health
crises in recent history with over 63,000 drug poisoning deaths in 2016
and a projected annual economic cost of over $420 billion. With the
rise of deaths and economic burden related to substance use, it is
paramount that systemic barriers within the treatment industry be
identified and resolved.
Methods: Data were collected from US substance use treatment
professionals (N = 182) in the fall of 2016. Thematic analysis with
axial coding was used on anonymized responses to an online open-ended
survey. Additional ad hoc testing for variance (education, generation,
regional location, and employment) was completed using Monte Carlo
chi-square analyses.
Results: 7 major themes emerged: 1) additional training, education, and
use of evidence-based practices, 2) expansion of treatment services, 3)
increased resources, 4) stigma reduction, 5) increased collaboration and
leadership, 6) reductions in regulations, requirements, and incentives,
and 7) expansion of recovery support services. Participant response
yielded a significant relationship between employment type (p = 0.002)
and regional location (p = 0.046).
Conclusions: Systemic barriers in the treatment field are prevalent from
the perspective of professionals engaged in the field. While previously
identified barriers are still present, newly reported barriers include:
1) lack of treatment services (e.g., capacity), 2) lack of technological
resources (e.g., technological support tools), 3) lack of recovery
support services (e.g., recovery housing), 4) lack of collaboration and
leadership (e.g., communication and partnership), and 5) increasing
unethical practices in the field (e.g., incentive-based patient
brokering).

N2  - Study Objective: Resident education in pediatric and adolescent
gynecology (PAG) is challenging. It encompasses patients from neonates
to young adults with different disorders involving multiple
subspecialties. Residents have inadequate exposure to PAG topics and
report lack of knowledge in this area. The objective of this study was
to determine if the North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent
Gynecology (NASPAG) Short Curriculum improves self-reported knowledge in
PAG among obstetrics and gynecology (ObGyn), family medicine, and
pediatric residents.
Design, Setting, Participants, Interventions, and Main Outcome Measures:
Participants were 47 US ObGyn, family medicine, and pediatric residency
training programs across a 4-month study window, from September to
December 2016. The NASPAG Short Curriculum was distributed to them with
a request to complete a retrospective pre-and post-test survey. Primary
outcome measure was improvement in self-perceived knowledge after
exposure to the curriculum.
Results: Forty-eight programs responded to the study comprising a total
of 1130 residents. One program was excluded because of logistical
barriers to the distribution of study incentive. In total, 1080
residents were invited and 103 chose to participate (10% response
rate); 68 residents completed all survey questions to be included in the
final analysis. After completing the curriculum, self-reported knowledge
improved in all 10 learning objectives, across all 3 specialties (47%
{[}32/68] to 82% {[}56/68]; P < .01). Pre-test knowledge correlated
with previous clinical exposure to PAG patients, but did not correlate
with year of residency training, type of residency, or previous PAG
lectures.
Conclusion: Significant deficiencies exist regarding self-reported
knowledge of core PAG topics among ObGyn, family medicine, and pediatric
residents. Use of the NASPAG Short Curriculum improves self-reported
knowledge in PAG trainees across all 3 specialties.

N2  - Green buildings or Environmentally Friendly Buildings (EFBs) take into
account conservation needs and use key resources more efficiently than
conventional buildings. However, EFBs, often characterized by relatively
high construction costs, may materialize benefits through long-term
maintenance and energy savings. Therefore, it is essential to convince
main players in the construction field, that investment in EFBs is
justifiable. This paper explores factors influencing investment
decisions of different interest groups - consumers, architects and
building developers - in green building. We hypothesis that each
interest group's different attitude towards EFBs may generate different
responses to identical incentives. The study is based on internet panel
and telephone surveys conducted in Israel. The findings reveals that
requirements of building standards and improving professional image are
main factors that affect architects' willingness to design EFBs, while
energy prices increase and striving for innovation are main forces
behind developers' decisions to promote green construction. By contrast,
potential energy and maintenance savings, and real estate values
increase are main factors influencing consumers' decisions to opt for
EFBs, as opposed to a conventional one. We also find that greater
familiarity of consumers with the green building concept increases their
willingness to pay 30% more for EFBs.

N2  - Background: Alcohol misuse is an important cause of premature disability
and death. While clinicians are recommended to ask patients about
alcohol use and provide brief interventions and specialist referral,
this is poorly implemented in routine practice. We undertook a national
consultation to ascertain the appropriateness of proposed standards for
recording information about alcohol use in electronic health records
(EHRs) in the UK and to identify potential barriers and facilitators to
their implementation in practice.
Methods: A wide range of stakeholders in the UK were consulted about the
appropriateness of proposed information standards for recording alcohol
use in EHRs via a multi-disciplinary stakeholder workshop and online
survey. Responses to the survey were thematically analysed using the
Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research.
Results: Thirty-one stakeholders participated in the workshop and 100 in
the online survey. This included patients and carers, healthcare
professionals, researchers, public health specialists, informaticians,
and clinical information system suppliers. There was broad consensus
that the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and
AUDIT-Consumption (AUDIT-C) questionnaires were appropriate standards
for recording alcohol use in EHRs but that the standards should also
address interventions for alcohol misuse. Stakeholders reported a number
of factors that might influence implementation of the standards,
including having clear care pathways and an implementation guide,
sharing information about alcohol use between health service providers,
adequately resourcing the implementation process, integrating alcohol
screening with existing clinical pathways, having good clinical
information systems and IT infrastructure, providing financial
incentives, having sufficient training for healthcare workers, and
clinical leadership and engagement. Implementation of the standards
would need to ensure patients are not stigmatised and that patient
confidentiality is robustly maintained.
Conclusions: A wide range of stakeholders agreed that use of AUDIT-C and
AUDIT are appropriate standards for recording alcohol use in EHRs in
addition to recording interventions for alcohol misuse. The findings of
this consultation will be used to develop an appropriate information
model and implementation guide. Further research is needed to pilot the
standards in primary and secondary care.

N2  - Background Local and national policies to encourage supermarket opening
or expansion are popular strategies for improving access to healthy food
for residents in neighborhoods lacking these types of stores, yet few
evaluations of such initiatives exist.
Objective Our aim was to test whether a newly opened supermarket in the
Bronx, NY, changed household availability of healthy and unhealthy food
items and reported daily consumption of these items among respondents
residing in close proximity (<= 0.5 mile) to the new supermarket.
Design This quasi-experimental study evaluated changes in purchasing and
consumption habits of residents within 0.5 mile of the new supermarket
as compared to residents living more than 0.5 mile from the supermarket.
Data were collected through street intercept surveys at three different
times: once before the store opened (March to August 2011) and in two
follow-up periods (1 to 5 months and 13 to 17 months after the store
opened). This study analyzed a subset of successfully geocoded resident
intersections from the larger study.
Participants/setting We surveyed 3,998 residents older than the age of
18 years in two Bronx neighborhoods about their food-purchasing
behaviors before the store opened and in two follow-up periods.
Responses from residents whose intersections were successfully geocoded
(N = 3,378) were analyzed to examine the consumption and purchasing
behaviors of those in close proximity to the new store.
Intervention A new supermarket opened in a low-access neighborhood in
the Bronx with the help of financial incentives through New York City's
Food Retail Expansion to Support Health (FRESH) program.
Main outcome measures The primary outcome evaluated was the change in
percent of respondents reporting that the following food items were
``always available{''} in the home: milk, fruit juice, soda, pastries,
packaged snacks, fruits, and vegetables. As a secondary outcome, we
explored changes in self-reported daily servings of these items.
Statistical analysis performed A difference-in-difference analysis was
performed, controlling for age, education, marital status, income, sex,
race, and ethnicity.
Results Residents within 0.5 mile of the store had increased household
availability of both healthy and unhealthy foods. After the introduction
of the supermarket, the percent of residents in close proximity to the
store who reported always having produce available in the home increased
by 8.8% compared to those living >0.5 mile from the store in the first
post-period and by 10.6% compared to those living >0.5 mile from the
store in the second post-period. A similar positive increase in
household availability of salty snacks and pastries was observed.
Residents living in close proximity also reported greater consumption of
healthy foods like produce and water, and lower intake of soft drinks
and pastries.
Conclusions Given the financial support at the national and local levels
to encourage supermarket development and expansion in high-need
communities, it is imperative to evaluate the impact of such
initiatives. Although the findings have so far been equivocal, our
findings give weight to the argument that, at a micro-level, the siting
of a new supermarket can indeed impact local purchasing and consumption
behavior. Although purchasing for both healthy and unhealthy food items
increased, reported consumption showed an increase in servings of
healthy items (water, vegetables, and fruit) and a decrease in servings
of unhealthy foods (soft drinks, salty snacks, and pastries).

N2  - Objectives Our aims were to assess the relationship between workplace
violence, job satisfaction, burnout, organisational support and turnover
intention, and to explore factors associated with turnover intention
among nurses in Chinese tertiary hospitals.
Methods The purposive sampling method was used to collect data from
August 2016 through January 2017. A total of 1 761 nurses from 9 public
tertiary hospitals in 4 provinces (municipalities) located in eastern
(Beijing), central (Heilongjiang, Anhui) and western (Shaanxi) regions
of China completed the questionnaires (effective response rate=85.20%).
A cross-sectional study was conducted using the Workplace Violence
Scale, Chinese Maslach Burnout Inventory General Survey, Minnesota Job
Satisfaction Questionnaire Revised Short Version, Perceived
Organizational Support-Simplified Version Scale and Turnover Intention
Scale.
Results A total of 1216 of 1 706 (69.1%) participants had high turnover
intention. During the previous 12 months, the prevalence of physical
violence and psychological violence towards nurses was 9.60% and
59.64%, respectively. As expected, the level of turnover intention was
negatively correlated with participants' scores on job satisfaction
(r=-0.367, p<0.001) and perceived organisational support (r=-0.379,
p<0.001), respectively. Burnout was positively associated with turnover
intention (r=0.444, p<0.001). Workplace violence was positively
associated with turnover intention (beta=0.035, p<0.001) in linear
regression analysis. The total effect (beta=0.53) of workplace violence
on turnover intention comprised its direct effect (beta=0.36) and its
indirect effect (beta=0.17).
Conclusions Perceived organisational support served as a mediator
between workplace violence, job satisfaction, burnout and turnover
intention, and it had a significantly negative impact on turnover
intention. Therefore, nursing managers should understand the importance
of the organisation's support and establish a reasonable incentive
system to decrease turnover intention.

HI, APR 29-MAY 03, 2018
N2  - IMPORTA.NCE. Wellness programs have become important strategies to
combat burnout and depression among residents. However, the resident
perspective on wellness in ophthalmic graduate medical education has not
been solicited on a national level.
OBJECTIVES To report on residents' views of wellness initiatives in
ophthalmic graduate medical education and identify potential strategies
for promoting resident wellness.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this national survey of
ophthalmology residents in the United States, conducted from September
21 to November 3, 2017, all 1048 ophthalmology residents listed on the
websites of ophthalmology residency programs accredited by the
Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education were emailed an
anonymous online survey consisting of 12 multiple-choice questions with
options for free-text answers. Residents also received a mailed letter
with a survey link and a $1 incentive, as well as 2 reminder emails.
Survey responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and the
free-text answers were categorized.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Main outcomes include residents' reports
regarding their personal experiences with wellness during residency,
support systems provided by their programs, and opportunities for
improving wellness in ophthalmic graduate medical education. RESULTS Of
1048 residents, 241 (23.0%) responded to the survey. Most respondents
(121 of 177 {[}68.4%]) reported that their programs faced an issue
involving depression, burnout, or suicide among residents within the
past year; 26.3% of respondents (61 of 232) reported being involved in
a case when resident fatigue, burnout, or depression adversely affected
a medical outcome or judgment. Fewer than half of the respondents (110
of 241 {[}45.6%]) reported that their residency programs placed
moderate or major emphasis on promoting a culture of resident wellness,
and only 26.7% (63 of 236) reported that their department had a formal
resident wellness program. The most commonly cited barrier to resident
wellness (59 of 236 {[}25.0%]) was a lack of time to attend wellness
programs.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These results suggest that there is a
substantial burden of burnout and depression among US ophthalmology
residents and that there are opportunities to boost wellness in
ophthalmic graduate medical education by making wellness curricula more
accessible to residents and ensuring that residents have time to attend
wellness programs.

N2  - Green buildings (GBs) bring multiple benefits to homebuyers. However,
the lack of knowledge or uncertainty about these benefits, combined with
a nominal price premium (PP) for GBs, may prevent prospective homebuyers
from entering the GB market. Therefore, governmental incentives may be
needed. The present study serves the dual purpose of examining the PP
size that prospective homebuyers in Israel are willing to pay (WTP) for
GBs, and investigating, for the first time, the potential impact of
prevalent GB policy instruments on the premium's size. Findings from a
nationwide online survey indicate an acceptable PP in the range of
7-10%. Expected maintenance savings and familiarity with GB concept and
benefits are found to be positively associated with the size of the
premium, while counterintuitively, financial incentives, such as tax
breaks and subsidized loans, are found to result in lesser, rather than
greater, WTP PP. This indicates that financial incentives to homebuyers
may be counterproductive by generating emotive and opposite responses,
and that a long-term governmental commitment to support GB maintenance
may be more effective. The study suggests a mix of financial and
non-financial GB incentives to homebuyers. The study mainly contributes
to better-understanding of how potential homebuyers' GB choice can be
encouraged by applying informed policy tools. It also emphasizes the
importance of evaluating unexpected consequences of future interventions
in the GB market.

N2  - Environmental benefits of riparian forest buffers (trees located along
streams) are well documented, yet an understanding of factors
influencing landowner adoption on properties adjacent to agricultural
fields is limited. Reasons for adoption and non-adoption were examined
using survey data collected from landowners in Kansas' Tuttle Creek
Reservoir watershed, an area of high concern for water quality and
quantity. Survey questionnaires focused on four latent adoption factors:
attitudes toward trees, economic motivation, knowledge of riparian
forest buffer benefits, and perceptions of government-funded incentive
programs. Responses were analyzed with Spearman's correlation
coefficient to determine whether relationships existed between landowner
type and each latent adoption factor, Cronbach's alpha for scale
reliability, and the Mann-Whitney U test for differences between
adopters and non-adopters. Significant differences between landowner
types were revealed indicating that riparian forest buffers were not
likely to be adopted if landowners had unfavorable attitudes toward
trees, were motivated by economic factors, were unaware of riparian
forest buffer benefits, or had negative perceptions of the current
design of government payment programs for establishing trees in riparian
areas. The following themes were identified for their potential to
increase adoption: riparian forest buffers need to be perceived as
profitable; opportunities exist for education; financial and technical
resources represent major constraints to riparian forest buffer
adoption; and there is an apparent need to create awareness of financial
assistance programs.

N2  - Aquaculture is one of the most dynamic food production systems in the
world, with a fast expansion, especially in developing countries. Among
this sector, the Chilean mussel industry has experienced a substantial
increase, turning Chile into one of the leading producers and global
exporters of mussels. Among the different links in the mussel production
chain, the natural seed collection conducted by artisanal fishers of
southern Chile has been a fundamental pillar for the development of the
industry. Often, this sub-sector has been thought of as a homogeneous
group, with similar responses to different challenges and public
policies. However, this is likely an unrealistic assumption, making it
necessary to understand the complexity of the local context and the
heterogeneity of producer groups within the territory. Using surveys and
multivariate statistical analysis, we explore typologies of artisanal
mussel seed producers in southern Chile. The results proposed four seed
producer entrepreneur typologies associated mainly with socioeconomic
features and their interactions with the environment. These variables
explain heterogeneity in organizational structures and equipment.
Spatial location and environmental conditions are important factors that
directly or indirectly influence the fishers' investment in equipment
and sales contracts. Our findings suggest that seed producer
heterogeneity should be considered when designing, implementing, and
providing policy incentives to support sustainable mussel aquaculture.
Our results identified groups of fishers whose entrepreneurship capacity
is vulnerable to environmental and market changes, informing future
needs for technical assistance and support.

N2  - The expansion of agricultural land remains one of the main drivers of
deforestation in tropical regions. Stronger land property rights could
possibly enable farmers to increase input intensity and productivity on
the already cultivated land, thus reducing incentives to expand their
farms by deforesting additional land. This hypothesis is tested with
data from a panel survey of farm households in Sumatra. The survey data
are combined with satellite imageries to account for spatial patterns,
such as historical forest locations. Results show that plots for which
farmers hold formal land titles are cultivated more intensively and are
more productive than untitled plots. However, due to land policy
restrictions, farmers located at the historic forest margins often do
not hold formal titles. Without land titles, these farmers are less able
to intensify and more likely to expand into the surrounding forest land
to increase agricultural output. Indeed, forest closeness and past
deforestation activities by households are found to be positively
associated with current farm size. In addition to improving farmer's
access to land titles for non-forest land, better recognition of
customary land rights and more effective protection of forest land
without recognized claims could be useful policy responses.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Incentive spirometry (IS) is widely used to prevent
postoperative pulmonary complications, despite limited clinical
effectiveness data and a lack of standardized use protocols. We sought
to evaluate health care professionals' perspectives on IS effectiveness
and use procedures. METHODS: An online survey was distributed via social
media and newsletters to relevant national nursing and respiratory care
societies. Attitudes concerning IS were compared between the American
Association for Respiratory Care (AARC) and the nursing societies.
RESULTS: A total of 1,681 responses (83.8% completion rate) were
received. The clear majority of these respondents agreed that IS is
essential to patient care (92.7%), improves pulmonary function
(92.0%), improves inspiratory capacity (93.0%), helps to prevent
(96.6%) and to reverse (90.0%) atelectasis, helps to prevent (92.5%)
and to reverse (68.4%) pneumonia, and is as effective as early
ambulation (74.0%), deep-breathing exercises (88.2%), and directed
coughing (79.8%). Furthermore, most health care professionals believed
that IS should be used routinely preoperatively (78.1%) and
postoperatively (91.1%), used every hour (59.8%), used for an average
of 9.6 (95% CI 9.3-9.9) breaths per session, used to achieve breath
holds of 7.8 (95% CI 7.4-8.2) s, used to reach an initial target
inspiratory volume of 1,288.5 (95% CI 1,253.8-1,323.2) mL, and used to
achieve a daily inspiratory volume improvement of 525.6 (95% CI
489.8-561.4) mL. Of all respondents, 89.6% believed they received
adequate IS education and training. Respondents from the AARC endorsed
significantly less agreement relative to the nursing societies on most
parameters for IS utility. CONCLUSIONS: There was a major discrepancy
between health care professionals' beliefs and the published clinical
effectiveness data supporting IS. Despite reported adequate education on
IS, variability in what health care professionals believed to be
appropriate use underscores the literature's lack of standardization and
evidence for specific use procedures.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Patient adherence is a critical factor for success of
patient-administered therapies, including incentive spirometry (IS).
Patient adherence with IS is not known, so we sought to evaluate
providers' perspectives on the current state of IS adherence and
elucidate possible factors hindering patient adherence. METHODS:
Respiratory therapists (RTs) and nurses across the United States were
surveyed via social media and online newsletters. Surveys were
distributed to the relevant national RT and nursing societies: the
American Association for Respiratory Care, the Academy of
Medical-Surgical Nurses, the American Society of Peri-Anesthesia Nurses,
and the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses. RESULTS: Responses
from 1,681 (83.8% completion rate) RTs and nurses were received. The
clear majority of all providers agreed that patient adherence is poor
(86.0%; 1,416 of 1,647 respondents) and should be improved (95.4%;
1,551 of 1,626 respondents). Providers believe that IS adherence is
hindered by various factors. The most common reasons cited were that
patients forget to use their ISs (83.5%; 1,404 of 1,681 respondents),
do not use them effectively (74.4%; 1,251 of 1,681 respondents), and do
not use them frequently enough (70.7%; 1,188 of 1,681 respondents).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings from a large national survey of health care
providers highlight the need for improved IS adherence and indicate that
patient forgetfulness may be a large contributor to nonadherence.
Efforts aimed at improving IS adherence are warranted.

N2  - There has been an increased demand by some sections of society for
higher farm animal welfare standards. In response, a number of
programmes marketing products of animal origin, produced under higher
animal welfare standards, have been established on the market in recent
years. However, the market segments for products from so-called animal
welfare programmes (AWPs) have remained small. Farmers are considered an
important stakeholder group for higher market shares of more animal
welfare-friendly products. Farmers' decision to adapt their production
to the requirements of AWPs is multi-dimensional, but always linked to
financial incentives. Since little is known about the financial
attractiveness of higher animal welfare standards in livestock farming,
this study investigates the perceived economic success of 579
conventional farmers keeping livestock on their farms. The survey data
were analysed using propensity score matching to assess the average
effect of participation in AWPs on a farm's perceived profitability,
liquidity and stability from the farmer's point of view. No significant
effect was found of participation in AWPs on the economic success of
farmers. The implications of this result are two-fold. On the one hand,
it suggests that it is of particular importance to create further
financial incentives to encourage farmers to take part in these
programmes. On the other, it shows that farmers' concerns that the
required costly and highly specific investments will pay off are
unfounded, as farmers participating in AWPs rate their own financial
situation as equivalent to that of their colleagues not participating in
AWPs.

companies offer large rewards; however, the existing academic literature
on how incentives influence SWOM communication is limited. To further
advance this line of research, this study explores the effect of
incentives on senders' positive emotions which, in turn, promote the
senders' SWOM intention. This study also investigates how unequal types
of incentive allocations (i.e., positive and negative inequity) moderate
the effect of incentives on senders' positive emotions and examined the
moderating effects of emotion regulation (i.e., reappraisal and
suppression) on the relationship between senders' positive emotions and
SWOM intention. We designed an online scenario survey and collected 650
valid responses from We Chat users in China The empirical results show
that (1) perceived incentives positively influence senders' positive
emotions which improve the senders' SWOM intention; (2) positive
emotions mediate the path from perceived incentives to SWOM intention;
(3) negative inequity weakens the relationship between perceived
incentive size and positive emotions, while the moderating effect of
positive inequity is not statistically significant; and (4) reappraisal
emotion regulation strengthens the effect of positive emotions on SWOM
intention, whereas the moderating effect of suppression emotion
regulation is not statistically significant.

the correlation of decisions across tasks is low and usually
statistically non-significant. However, when we consider only subjects
whose behavior across the panels of the SG task is compatible with
constant relative risk aversion (CRRA), the correlation between HL and
self-assessed risk attitude becomes significant. Furthermore, the

N2  - A key component to understanding demand response programs design is
elasticity, which reflects customer reaction to economic offers. In this
work, customer elasticity for Incentive Based Demand Response (IBDR)
programs is estimated using data from two nation wide surveys and
integrated with a detailed residential load model. In addition,
incentive based elasticity is calculated at the individual appliance
level since this is more effective for operations than at an aggregate
value for a feeder. The concept of appliance base elasticity is derived
from various contributions of each appliance in the aggregate load
signal and the necessity of use for the customer. Results show that the
needed customer incentive for certain loads, such as, lighting and
washing is less than HVAC, but since the HVAC energy share in total load
is much higher generally, it has greater elasticity. Considering the
important role of HVAC in the aggregate load signal, the elasticity is
studied in more detail using estimates of different thermostat settings.
Analysis shows that elasticity of HVAC decreases while average power
increases. To disaggregate the load signal for each appliance, a
constrained non-negative matrix factorization (CNMF) method is proposed.
In addition, this method is used to decompose the HVAC signal to
identify different thermostat settings. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier

Apart from advanced green technologies, consumers' purchasing intention

promotion of GB. However, which determinants significantly affect
consumers' purchasing intention remain unclear, especially for the young
generation in developing countries. This study attempts to investigate
young consumers' purchasing intention of GH in China. On the basis of
extended theory of planned behavior (TPB), seven constructs are
identified, and nine hypotheses are proposed. A total of 241 responses
were collected from the questionnaire survey, and structural equation
modeling was employed to test the proposed hypotheses. Governmental
incentives are affirmed to be the most important determinant, followed
by consumers' attitude toward behavior and subjective norm. Perceived
behavioral control is an insignificant determinant for young consumers
to purchase GH. In addition, subjective knowledge has an indirect effect
through attitude toward behavior. Environmental concern also confirms an
indirect effect through attitude toward behavior and subjective norm
toward purchasing intention, respectively. Thus, the government is
implied to play a crucial role in GH promotion at this stage.

N2  - This study examines the relationships between motivations, modes of
participation and loyalty intentions of consumers of tourism brand pages
on Facebook (TBPF). The study introduces an integrative theoretical and
exploratory model that describes the impact of motivation on online
consumer behavior (extent of participation and degree of active
contribution) and attitudes toward particular brands (repurchase and
recommendation intention). A digital survey posted on TBPF elicited 903
responses. Four factors of motives for participation were
identifiedfunctional, social-psychological, hedonistic, and incentive
motiveswith varying levels of importance. Social-psychological motives
were the main predictors for ``active-participation{''} in TBPF. There
was a positive significant correlation between all the modes of
participation and consumers' loyalty intentions. The findings were
significantly different from previous studies of online tourism
communities with regard to the impact of social-psychological motives on
consumer's electronic word-of-mouth participation and loyalty
intentions. The implications for the theory and marketing management are
discussed, as is the study's contribution to effective marketing
management of TBPF.

N2  - Because research on the impact of web survey incentives has exclusively
focused on Western settings, it is unclear to what extent current
insights translate and generalize to non-Western societies, which are
usually characterized by very different economic conditions, cultural
traditions, and survey climates. The current article presents the
results of a web survey incentives experiment among almost 4,440
Ghanaian university students who were offered conditional and
unconditional incentives of different values (in the form of telephone
credit). Our analyses partly replicate Western findings: Higher value
incentives produce higher participation rates and unconditional
incentives outperform conditional ones in the lower value conditions. In
the case of relatively high incentives, however, conditional outperforms
unconditional incentives. No differential effects of incentives on
response quality were found.

Data Sources/Study SettingSecondary analysis of data from Cancer Care
Outcomes Research and Surveillance (CanCORS). Recruitment occurred from
2003 to 2005.
Study DesignThe study was a cross-sectional observational study. The
respondents were patients with incident colorectal or lung cancer or
their proxies.
Data Collection/Extraction MethodsAnalyses used linear regression models
with an independent variable for proxy versus patient responses as well
as study site and clinical covariates. The outcomes were experiences
with medical care, nursing care, care coordination, and care quality
rating. Multiple imputation was used for missing data.
Principal FindingsAmong 6,471 respondents, 1,011 (16 percent) were
proxies. The proportion of proxy respondents varied from 6 percent to 28
percent across study sites. Adjusted proxy scores were modestly higher
for medical care experiences (+1.28 points {[}95 percent CI:+ 0.05 to
+2.51]), but lower for nursing care (-2.81 {[}95 percent CI: -4.11 to
-1.50]) and care coordination experiences (-2.98 {[}95 percent CI: -4.15
to -1.81]). There were no significant differences between adjusted
patient and proxy ratings of quality.
ConclusionsProxy responses have small but statistically significant
differences from patient responses. However, if ratings of care are used
for financial incentives, such differences could be exaggerated across
practices or areas if proxy use varies.

N2  - Social movements and interest groups in developing countries
increasingly challenge large firms to influence their behavior and make
direct claims for redistribution of the gains from economic activity. In
response to such private politics, firms seek to maintain political
support in the localities in which they operate so that they can avoid
conflict and secure access to resources. To secure local support and
defuse opposition, some firms take actions that expand access to
essential public goods, services, and economic opportunities, while
others use targeted clientelistic benefits that reward only a few. What
accounts for this variation? Answering this question is key to
identifying the development consequences of private politics. This
article explores this question through a study of multinational mining
firms operating in Bolivia, drawing on qualitative data from interviews
as well as an original household survey. It shows that the political
structures and organization in the localities in which firms operate
create distinct incentives for firms to distribute benefits in targeted
or inclusive ways. This finding contributes to studies of the local
politics of natural resources and firm responses to social contestation.

N2  - Residential direct load control (DLC) is an important type of demand
response designed to reduce electricity consumption during peak hours
through utility companies' control over the operation of certain
household appliances. Despite many benefits of DLC, customers' concern
for losing control has been hindering its adoption. This study aims to
investigate U.S. residents' willingness to accept two popular A/C
-related DLC programs in summertime with or without financial incentives
or an override option, and to identify the socio-demographic
characteristics associated with the decisions. Results of an online
survey among 1482 U.S. residents indicate half of the participants are
willing to accept DLC without any conditions; however, both an incentive
of $30 and an override option boost acceptance rates, Importantly, the
override option is more effective than the financial incentive.
Residents who are younger, Democrats, non-Whites, have higher education
levels, live in larger dwellings, and live with more people are more
likely to adopt DLC than their counterparts. Residents who are older,
Republicans, Whites, homeowners, and live in a house preferred an
override option to financial incentives more often. The implications
were discussed in terms of improving power system stability through
better DLC program design and implementation. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Objectives: To ascertain the reasons for, benefits of, and barriers to
pursuing the American Academy of HIV Medicine (AAHIVM) HIV Pharmacist
(AAHIVP) credential.
Methods: A cross-sectional study using an electronic self-administered
survey was used. Two separate invitations to participate in online
surveys were sent to pharmacists who practice in HIV-related settings: 1
to pharmacists with the AAHIVP credential and 1 to members of key
pharmacy organizations and employers without the credential. The surveys
assessed demographics, concurrent credentials and certifications, and
factors influencing the pursuit of and benefits gained from having the
AAHIVP credential (credentialed population) or barriers to pursuing the
AAHIVP credential (credentialed and noncredentialed populations).
Results: There were 192 participants (survey response rate 38.8%) in
the credentialed population and 212 participants in the noncredentialed
population. Perceived recognition as an HIV expert from pharmacist (n =
174; 90.6%) and physician (n = 162; 84.4%) peers was the main reason
for credentialing; only 20.4% (n = 23/113) of participants' employers
reimbursed for the credential. Common reasons for nonpursuit included
lack of employer incentive (n = 46; 26.6%) and lack of fee
reimbursement (n = 38; 21.9%) in those aware of the credential.
However, a majority of these noncredentialed participants reported they
would be interested in pursuing credentialing (n = 152; 80.4%).
Conclusion: AAHIVP credentialing is sought and maintained on the basis
of perceived intangible benefits, such as peer recognition, over
tangible benefits, such as increased salary and reimbursement by
third-party payers. Despite interest, a lack of employer reimbursement
is perceived to be a barrier to AAHIVP credentialing among those who
have not yet been credentialed. (C) 2018 American Pharmacists

N2  - The public's party-driven misinformation and misperceptions about
politics has drawn a great deal of attention from scholars over the past
decade. While much of this research assumes that the misinformation
documented by survey researchers is an accurate reflection of what
individuals truly believe, other scholars have suggested that
individuals intentionally and knowingly provide misinformation to survey
researchers as a way of showing support for their political side. To
date, it has been difficult to adjudicate between these two contrasting
explanations for misperceptions. However, in this note, we provide such
a test. We take advantage of a controversy regarding the relative sizes
of crowds at the presidential inaugurations of Donald Trump in 2017 and
Barack Obama in 2009 to ask a question where the answer is so clear and
obvious to the respondents that nobody providing an honest response
should answer incorrectly. Yet, at the same time, the question taps into
a salient political controversy that provides incentives for Trump
supporters to engage in expressive responding. We find clear evidence of
expressive responding; moreover, this behavior is especially prevalent
among partisans with higher levels of political interest. Our findings
provide support for the notion that at least some of the misinformation
reported in surveys is the result of partisan cheerleading rather than
genuinely held misperceptions.

N2  - Energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generally aim to (i) reduce
energy use and hence emissions, (ii) steer consumers away from fossil
fuels and/or electricity generated from fossil fuels, and (iii) align
demand and supply, making sure that the existing infrastructure can
handle times of high demand. Policies thus include a variety of pricing
schemes, taxes on energy inputs, energy efficiency standards and
incentives, and renewables standards and incentives. Ex ante and ex post
analyses of their effectiveness thus rely crucially on understanding how
consumers respond to pricing schemes, taxes, and other policies. This
paper presents an overview of the challenges faced when empirically
estimating household energy demand. It describes the difficulties
associated with estimating the price elasticity of demand, discussing
behavioral responses that may make consumers relatively insensitive to
price changes or taxes. It also surveys empirical evidence about
non-price policies, such as clearer information or real-time feedback
about energy use, and appeal to norms. The paper concludes discussing
evidence about the rebound effect, the energy efficiency gap, and how
suppliers respond to a variety of policies.

N2  - Purpose: To explore combinations of worksite supports (WSS) for physical
activity (PA) that may assist employees in meeting PA recommendations
and to investigate how availability of WSS differs across industries and
occupations.
Design: Cross-sectional.
Setting: Several Missouri metropolitan areas.
Participants: Adults employed >20 h/wk outside the home.
Measures: Survey utilized existing self-reported measures (eg, presence
of WSS for PA) and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire.
Analysis: Logistic regression was conducted for 2 outcome variables:
leisure and transportation PA. Independent variables included 16 WSS. Of
particular interest were interaction effects between WSS variables.
Analyses were stratified by 5 occupation and 7 industry types.
Results: Overall, 2013 people completed the survey (46% response rate).
Often, availability of 1 WSS did not increase the likelihood of meeting
PA recommendations, but several pairs of WSS did. For example, in
business occupations, the odds of meeting PA recommendations through
transportation PA increased when employees had access to showers and
incentives to bike/walk (odds ratio {[}OR] - 1.6; 95% confidence
interval {[}CI] - 1.16-2.22); showers and maps (OR - 1.25; 1.02-1.55);
maps and incentives to bike/walk (OR - 1.48; 1.04-2.12).
Conclusion: Various combinations of WSS may increase the likelihood that
employees will meet PA recommendations. Many are of low or no cost,
including flexible time for exercise and maps of worksite-adjacent
walk/bike routes. Findings may be instructive for employers seeking to
improve employee health through worksite PA.

value-oriented individuals evaluated the system more positively and were
more willing to participate. Career-oriented motivation and technical
expertise had a partial influence. Different incentives emphasized in

N2  - Understanding homeowners' renovation decisions is essential for policy
and business activity to improve the efficiency of owner-occupied
housing stock. This paper develops, validates and applies a novel
modelling framework for explaining renovation decisions, with an
emphasis on energy-efficiency measures. The framework is tested using
quantitative data from a nationally-representative survey of
owner-occupied households in the UK (n = 1028).
The modelling advances formal representations of renovation decisions by
including background conditions of domestic life to which renovating is
an adaptive response. Path analysis confirms that three conditions of
domestic life are particularly influential on renovation decisions:
balancing competing commitments for how space at home is used;
signalling identity through homemaking activities; and managing physical
vulnerabilities of household members. These conditions of domestic life
also capture the influence of property characteristics (age, type) and
household characteristics (size, composition, length of tenure) on
renovation decisions but with greater descriptive realism.
Multivariate probit models are used to provide rigorous, transparent and
analytically tractable representations of the full renovation decision
process. Model fits to the representative national sample of UK
homeowners are good. The modelling shows that renovation intentions
emerge initially from certain conditions of domestic life, at which
point energy efficiency is not a distinctive type of renovation. The
modelling also shows clearly that influences on renovation decisions
change through the decision process. This has important implications for
policy and service providers. Efficiency measures should be bundled into
broader types of home improvements, and incentives should target the
underlying reasons why homeowners decide to renovate in the first place.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The use of incentive compensation in academic
family medicine has been a topic of interest for many years, yet little
is known about the impact of these systems on individual faculty
members. Better understanding is needed about the relationship of
incentive compensation systems (ICSs) to ICS satisfaction, motivation,
and retention among academic family medicine faculty.
METHODS: The Council of Academic Family Medicine (cAFM) Educational
Research Alliance (CERA) conducted a nationwide survey of its members in
2013. This study reports the results of the incentive compensation
question subset of the larger omnibus survey.
RESULTS: The overall response rate was 53%. The majority (70%
{[}360/511]) of academic faculty reported that they are eligible for
some type of incentive compensation. The faculty reported moderate
satisfaction, with only 38% being satisfied or highly satisfied with
their ICS. Overall mean motivation and intent to remain in their current
position were similar. The percentage of total income available as an
incentive explained less than 10% of the variance of those outcomes.
Faculty perceptions of appropriateness of the measures, understanding of
the measurement and reward systems, and perception of due process are
all related to satisfaction with the ICS, motivation, and retention.
CONCLUSIONS: ICSs are common in academic family medicine, yet most
faculty do not find them to motivate their choice of activities or
promote staying in their current position. Design and implementation are
both important in promoting faculty satisfaction with the ICS,
motivation, and retention.

N2  - Purpose There are currently no evidence-based indications for surgical
stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF) in patients without flail chest.
The purpose of this survey was to identify patients for whom there is
relative equipoise (operative vs. non-operative) in order to assist in
designing a randomized clinical trial.
Methods Members of the Chest Wall Injury Society were sent an online
survey, in which 18 patient scenarios were presented. The baseline
patient had >= three displaced, contiguous fractures and had no other
contraindications for surgery. This default scenario was then varied
based upon patient age, degree of traumatic brain injury (TBI), fracture
series location, and number of abnormal pulmonary physiologic variables
(oxygen requirement, respiratory rate, incentive spirometry ability,
cough, and numeric pain score).
Results Thirty respondents provided a total of 540 answers. Overall, the
majority of responses were in favor of SSRF (n = 413, 84.1%).
Furthermore, the vast majority of responses indicated that some degree
of pulmonary compromise was necessary to recommend SSRF (n = 44,
90.4%), with >= two abnormal parameters being the most common threshold
(n = 156, 31.8%). Decision to recommend SSRF varied significantly by
number of abnormal clinical variables, age, and degree of TBI, but not
by fracture series location. Patients aged 85 years old and those with
moderate TBI were the least likely to be recommended for SSRF,
regardless of abnormal pulmonary physiologic variables. The most
appropriate cutoff for equipoise appeared to be a patient aged 21-79
years old, with no or mild TBI, >= two abnormal pulmonary parameters,
and regardless of fracture location (44.8% consensus for SSRF).
Conclusion SSRF was recommended for most patients with non-flail,
displaced rib fractures. However, this recommendation was contingent
upon patient age, degree of TBI, and pulmonary clinical status. Results
of this survey may be used to inform inclusion criteria for a future
randomized, clinical trial.

training through this survey study.
Methods-A 26-question anonymous survey was emailed to 597 graduates of
70 fellowships over a 4-week period. No incentives were provided for
completion of the questionnaire. Descriptive statistics are reported.
For qualitative data, open- and axial-coding methods were used.
Results-A total of 336 participants completed the study for a response
rate of 56%. The average age of respondents was 36.4 years, and 58%
were male. Most graduates had MD degrees (89%) or DO degrees (10%).
Sixty percent of graduates attended a 3-year emergency medicine
residency, and 29% attended a 4-year residency. Only 11% pursued
additional fellowship training, most commonly pediatric emergency
medicine (n=14). After fellowship, 63% (95% confidence interval
{[}CI], 62.9, 63.1) of graduates began working full-time in an academic
setting, whereas 24% (95% CI, 23.9, 24.1) worked full-time in a
community setting. Thirty-three percent (95% CI, 32.7, 33.3) took an
immediate position as ultrasound division director, whereas 4% (95%
CI, 3.7, 4.3) became fellowship directors and 3% (95% CI, 2.7, 3.3)
became ultrasound medical student directors. Currently, 67% (95% CI,
66-68%) identify ultrasound as their leading academic focus.
Conclusions-Although not all fellowship graduates pursue academic
positions, most note the impact of fellowship on their career paths.
Graduates hold a variety of leadership positions. Approximately two

their effect on nonresponse bias has not been researched as much. To
contribute to the research, we analyze an incentive experiment embedded
within the third wave of the German household panel survey Panel Labor
Market and Social Security conducted by the German Institute for
Employment Research. Our question is whether attrition bias differs in
two incentive plans. In particular, we want to study whether an
unconditional Euro10 cash incentive yields less attrition bias in
self-reported labor income and other sociodemographics than a
conditional lottery ticket incentive. We find that unconditional cash
incentives are more effective than conditional lottery tickets in
reducing attrition bias in income and several sociodemographic

N2  - Free or subsidised mosquito net (MN) distribution has been an
increasingly important tool in efforts to combat malaria in recent
decades throughout the developing world, making great strides towards
eradicating this hugely detrimental disease. However, there has been
increasing concern in the natural resource management and healthcare
communities over alternative use of MNs, particularly in artisanal
fisheries where it has been suggested they pose a threat to
sustainability of fish stocks. So far, little evidence has been
presented as to the global prevalence and characteristics of MN fishing,
limiting global management initiatives and incentives for action across
disciplines. We conducted a rapid global assessment of mosquito net
fishing (MNF) observations from expert witnesses living and/or working
in malarial zones using an internet survey. MNF was found to be a
broadly pan-tropical activity, particularly prevalent in sub-Saharan
Africa. MNF is conducted using a variety of deployment methods and
scales including seine nets, scoop/dip nets, set nets and traps. MNF was
witnessed in a broad range of marine and freshwater habitats and was
seen to exploit a wide range of taxa, with capture of juvenile fish
reported in more than half of responses. Perceived drivers of MNF were
closely related to poverty, revealing potentially complex and arguably
detrimental livelihood and food security implications which we discuss
in light of current literature and management paradigms. The key
policies likely to influence future impacts of MNF are in health,
regarding net distribution, and natural resource management regarding
restrictions on use. We outline critical directions for research and
highlight the need for a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach to
development of both localised and broad-scale policy.

perceived impact on quality, and we investigated the relationship
between availability and perceived importance.
Results: We received responses from 31% of eligible institutions,
representing all major geographic regions of Turkey. Mean availability
of 50 HIS functions was 65.6%, ranging from 19.6% to 97.4%. Mean
importance score was 7.87 (on a 9-point scale) ranging from 7.13 to
8.41. Functions related to result management (89.3%) and decision
support systems (52.2%) had the highest and lowest reported
availability respectively. Availability and perceived importance were
moderately correlated (r = 0.52).
Conclusion: QDs report high importance of the HIS functions surveyed as
they relate to quality and patient safety. Availability and perceived
importance of HIS functions are generally correlated, with some
interesting exceptions. These findings may inform future investments and
guide policy changes within the Turkish healthcare system. Financial
incentives, regulations around certified HIS, revisions to accreditation
manuals, and training interventions are all policies which will help
integrate HIS functions to support quality and patient safety in Turkish
hospitals.

N2  - Purpose Mobile social apps permeate every facet of daily life through
the pervasive use of smartphones. Customer retention with mobile social
apps has become extremely important for app-related companies. The
purpose of this paper is to explore why experienced users in mobile
social apps (e.g. WeChat) are likely to continue using the app.
Design/methodology/approach This study proposed a conceptual model to
identify key determinants of continuance intention of WeChat users and
highlight the effects of individual experience. Data were collected from
WeChat users, which is one of the most popular mobile social apps in
China. The study employed partial least squares regression to test the
research model based on a survey of 295 valid responses.
Findings Results showed that trust, which was driven by user
satisfaction and perceived critical mass, played a critical role in
influencing the continuance intention of WeChat users. Moreover, tie
strength exerted a negative moderating effect on the relationship
between trust and continuance intention. Specifically, tie strength and
perceived critical mass had strong impacts on the continuance intention
of low-experience users. In addition, the effect of frequency was
closely associated with the continuance intention of high-experience
users.
Research limitations/implications This study addressed the issue of
mobile social app continuance intention by providing an innovative means
to explore the key antecedents of user continuance intention from the
experience perspective. The findings not only prove that trust plays a
central role in influencing the continuance intention of experienced
users but also reveal that the determinants of continuance intention
vary among users with different experience. The results provide insights
into the key antecedents of experienced WeChat user continuance
intention and contribute to the literature on mobile social apps and
individual differences.
Practical implications The results provide suggestions for mobile social
app practitioners to effectively plan mobile social app retention
practices and to set up appropriate incentive mechanisms for retaining
users with different experiences.
Originality/value Although abundant studies have focused on the adoption
of media users, few studies have investigated the post-adoption behavior
of experienced users in the context of mobile social apps. This study
revealed the key determinants of the continuance intention of WeChat
users and pinpointed the different impacts of these antecedents on users
with different levels of experience. It also provides useful guidelines
for practitioners to effectively retain users with different levels of
experience.

N2  - Objectives: We sought to understand how pharmacists viewed and used a
newly implemented prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP). We also
sought to understand pharmacist orientation toward dispensing of
controlled substances and the people who obtain them. Methods: We
conducted three mini focus groups. The focus group findings were used to
inform the design of a structured survey. We emailed a survey to 160
pharmacists who were employed in one statewide community chain store; we
obtained 48 survey responses. Results: Focus groups findings suggested
that, in relation to the dispensing of scheduled prescription
medication, pharmacists were either healthcare oriented, law-enforcement
oriented, or an orientation that combined these two perspectives.
Surveys suggested that pharmacists found PDMPs easy to use and that they
used them frequently - often to contact physicians directly. Surveys
suggested that pharmacists were typically either healthcare oriented or
mixed (combined perspectives). Pharmacist orientation was associated
with the frequency with which they counseled patients about medication
risk and the frequency with which they used the PDMP as the basis for
contacting prescribers. Conclusions: Ongoing tracking of pharmacists'
use of PDMPs is important both at the implementation stage and as PDMPs
develop over time. The orientation construct developed here is useful in
understanding pharmacist behavior and attitudes towards patients
potentially at risk for misuse of controlled substance medications.
Further research on this construct could shed light on barriers and
incentives for pharmacist PDMP participation and use and provide
guidance for pharmacist training, ultimately enhancing patient care.

N2  - Objective: The majority of U.S. teens admit to handheld cellphone use
while driving, an increasingly common cause of crashes. Attitudes toward
novel cellphone applications and settings that block use while driving
are poorly understood, potentially limiting uptake. We examined teens'
willingness to reduce cellphone use while driving and perceptions of
potential strategies to limit this behavior.Methods: Teen drivers (n =
153) aged 16-17 who owned smartphones and admitted to texting while
driving completed an online survey. Survey instruments measured
willingness to give up cellphone use and perceptions of technological
and behavioral economic strategies to reduce cellphone use while
driving. We used chi-square tests to test the hypothesis that
willingness to give up certain types of cellphone use while driving and
the perceptions of strategies to reduce cellphone use while driving
would differ by self-reported frequency of texting while driving in the
past 30days (low {[}1-5days] vs. high {[}6 or more days]).Results: Most
teens were willing or somewhat willing to give up reading texts (90%),
sending texts (95%), and social media (99%) while driving. However,
they were not willing to give up navigation (59%) and music
applications (43%). Those who engaged in high-frequency texting while
driving were more likely to say that they were not willing to give up
navigation applications (73vs. 44%, P <.001), music applications (54vs.
32%, P <.001), and reading texts (15vs. 4%, P =.029). Overall, the
following strategies where rated as likely to be very effective for
reducing texting while driving: gain-framed financial incentives (75%),
loss-framed financial incentives (63%), group-based financial
incentives (58%), insurance discounts (53%), automatic phone locking
while driving (54%), e-mail notifications to parents (47%), automated
responses to incoming texts (42%), peer concern (18%), and parental
concern (15%). Those who engaged in high-frequency texting while
driving were less likely to say that following strategies would be very
effective: automated responses to incoming texts (33vs. 53%, P =.016),
peer concern (9vs. 29%, P =.002), and parental concern (9vs. 22%, P
=.025). The strongest perceived benefit of cellphone blocking apps was
decreasing distraction (86%). The predominant reason for not wanting to
use this technology was not wanting parents to monitor their behavior
(60%).Conclusions: Promising strategies for increasing acceptance of
cellphone blocking technology among teen drivers include automated
screen locking and permitting hands-free navigation and music combined
with behavioral economic incentives to sustain engagement.

N2  - Incentives are often discussed in the literature on the topic as a way
to increase response rates. In this article, sample composition and item
nonresponse are also considered. Using social exchange theory, the
concept of social inequality is theoretically linked to the effect of
incentives and is empirically tested using data from a recruitment
experiment for an online survey in Austria. Since the participants of
the Austrian micro-census were used as the selection framework, a
detailed analysis of nonresponse is possible. Based on the four
different incentives (a brochure, a (sic)2 commemorative coin, a C5
commemorative coin and a (sic)10 voucher), conclusions can be drawn
about the different forms incentives take and the values they hold. The
results underline the potential of incentives to increase response
rates, but at the same time they reveal potential distortion problems.

N2  - Objective: Despite popularity of climate surveys as a tool produce
accurate data on campus sexual assault, little is known about how
campuses are administering these surveys, what they are assessing, and
what they are finding. Participants: A sample of 105 campus climate
survey reports was located with an internet search during the 2015-2016
academic year. Methods: Review of climate survey reports assessed the
methodology used, such as sampling method, use of incentives and sample
size and response rate. Document review also assessed the topics
included in the climate survey reports and key findings related to
victimization, perpetration, and student knowledge of resources.
Results: Most campuses reported victimization rates, but few reported
perpetration rates. Students generally express confidence in their
knowledge of campus resources, but reporting of sexual violence was low.
Conclusion: Climate surveys are inconsistent and do not always use
scientifically sound measurement. Suggestions for improving climate
surveys are discussed.

N2  - Cropping system diversity can help build greater agroecosystem
resilience by suppressing insect, weed, and disease pressures while also
mitigating effects of extreme and more variable weather. Despite the
potential benefits of cropping systems diversity, few farmers in the US
Corn Belt use diverse rotations. This study examines factors that may
influence farmers' decisions to use more diversified crop rotations in
the US Corn Belt through a parallel convergent mixed methods approach,
using a multi-level analysis of Corn Belt farmer survey data (n = 4,778)
and in-depth interviews (n = 159). Analyses were conducted to answer
questions regarding what factors influence farmers' use of extended crop
rotations in intensive corn-based cropping systems and to explore
whether farmers in the Corn Belt might use extended crop rotations in
response to climatic changes. Findings suggest that path dependency
associated with the intensive corn-based cropping system in the region
limits farmers' ability to integrate more diverse crop rotations.
However, farmers in more diversified watersheds, those who farm marginal
land, and those with livestock are more likely to use extended
rotations. Additionally, farmers who currently use more diverse
rotations are also more likely to plan to use crop rotations as a
climate change adaptation strategy. If more diverse cropping systems are
desired to reduce climate risks, in addition to reducing the negative
impacts associated with industrial agricultural production, then further
efforts must be made to facilitate more diverse crop rotations in the
U.S. Corn Belt. This may be achieved by adjusting policy and economic
incentives that presently discourage cropping system diversity in the
region.

N2  - Background: Illicit substance use remains highly prevalent in the US,
and epidemiological surveillance surveys estimate that in 2015, over 27
million individuals (10.1% of the US population) 12 years of age or
older used illicit drugs in the past 30 days.(1) Outpatient treatment
delivered in community-based settings is the dominant modality for
addiction treatment, typically involving weekly psychosocial counseling
sessions in an individual and/or group format.(2,3) Unfortunately,
relapse and premature treatment discontinuation are quite common in
outpatient treatment.(3-5)Objectives: This is a pilot proof of concept
feasibility study involving clients presenting for outpatient SUD
treatment. This study sought to examine the feasibility and
acceptability of the Daily Progress System (DPS), a telephone-based
software program, using interactive voice response (IVR), designed to
enhance quality care and improve client outcomes. Methods: Individuals
who presented at the participating treatment clinic, who met study
eligibility criteria, and who provided written informed consent to
participate were included in the study (N = 15; 53.3% females).
Incentives were paid to participants for calls completed. Results:
Participants completed 65% of scheduled daily call-ins, representing
273 person-days of data on client cravings, mood, substance use, and
involvement in recovery support activities. The average call duration
was approximately 2 minutes and 42 seconds. There was a high degree of
client and counselor acceptance and satisfaction using the system.
Conclusions and Clinical Significance: Findings suggest that the DPS
appears to be a feasible means of potentially addressing relapse and
treatment engagement issues based on client and counselor engagement and
satisfaction with the system.

N2  - Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) represent a promising solution to
carbon emissions within the transportation sector, but relatively little
is known about how limited-range vehicles will change consumer behavior.
This study evaluates the impact of large-scale introduction of BEVs on
the new car market in Norway, and seeks to determine whether BEVs lead
to an increase in household vehicle ownership. Analysis of online survey
responses from 4405 new car owners suggests that BEVs lead to an
increase in household vehicle ownership of approximately 15-20%. We
arrive at this finding using three independent methods: logistic
regression of the likelihood of replacing a vehicle on vehicle type,
analysis of correlation between the rate of vehicle replacement and BEV
market share across municipalities, and linear regression of changes in
total new car sales on changes in BEV sales across counties and years.
Survey responses on driving habits also suggest that BEV purchases lead
to a moderate increase in vehicle miles traveled. These results suggest
that real-world emissions savings may be somewhat less than those
predicted by life-cycle analysis. Policy recommendations include
focusing incentives for BEVs on those bought as replacements for a
conventional vehicle.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To report on the status of residency-based wellness
initiatives in ophthalmic graduate medical education and identify
strategies for promoting ophthalmology resident wellness by surveying US
ophthalmology program directors (PDs).
DESIGN: The PDs were each sent an e-mail containing a link to an
anonymous online 15-question survey. The PDs also received a letter with
the survey link and a $1 incentive. After 2 weeks, nonresponders
received 2 weekly reminder e-mails and phone calls. Descriptive
statistics were used to analyze the multiple choice responses and
categorize the free response answers.
SETTING: National survey.
PARTICIPANTS: All 111 US ophthalmology PDs were invited to participate.
RESULTS: Of 111 PDs, 56 (50%) responded; 14 (26%) of 53 respondents
reported that their programs faced an issue involving resident
depression, burnout, or suicide within the last year; 25 (45%) of 56
reported that their department had a resident wellness program.
Respondents without wellness programs reported a shortage of time
(19/30; 63%) and lack of training and resources (19/30; 63%) as
barriers to instituting these programs. Respondents reported that the
Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education could better
promote resident wellness by providing training resources for burnout
and depression screening (35/53; 66%), resilience skills building
(38/53; 72%), and wellness program development (36/53; 68%).
CONCLUSIONS: This survey suggests that there is a substantial burden of
burnout and depression among residents in ophthalmic graduate medical
education and that this burden can be addressed by promoting the
training of educators to recognize the signs of burnout and depression,
and providing resources to develop and expand formal wellness programs.

N2  - Out-of-class learning with technology comprises an essential context of
second language development. Understanding the nature of out-of-class
language learning with technology is the initial step towards
safeguarding its quality. This study examined the types of learning
experiences that language learners engaged in outside the classroom and
the influencing factors. Three distinct types of technological
experiences, with different incentives and different emotional and
behavioral manifestations, were identified based on the interview
responses of 21 university foreign language learners. Structural
equation modeling analysis of 439 survey responses indicated that the
three types of technological experiences were influenced differently by
various attitudinal and support factors. Instruction-oriented
technological experiences were influenced the most by learners'
perception of the usefulness of the technological experience for
language learning, and entertainment-and information-oriented
technological experiences were the only technological experiences that
were influenced directly by perceived ease of the technological
experience for language learning. Social-oriented technological
experiences were influenced by myriad factors. Furthermore, it was found
that the influencing factors for these experiences varied for learners
with beginning and with intermediate proficiency levels. The findings
underscore the importance of adopting differentiated approaches to
supporting different types of technological experiences.

N2  - Purpose - A planet that can no longer sustain life is a frightening
thought - and one that is often present in mass media messages.
Therefore, this study aims to test the components of a classic fear
appeal theory, the extended parallel process model (EPPM) and to
determine how well its constructs predict sustainability behavioral
intentions. This study also strove to uncover students' motivations and
attitudes that are not present in the EPPM.
Design/methodology/approach - An online survey of 779 college students
was conducted.
Findings - Results reveal that both threat and efficacy are significant
predictors of behavioral intention, consistent with the EPPM. However,
an analysis of open-ended comments reveals that subjective normative
influence and incentives also play a key role in students performing
future sustainable behaviors.
Practical implications - These findings provide a framework to educators
and message designers of sustainability groups on college campuses
highlighting the importance of including multiple constructs in their
messages to students. Threatening messages will not be enough to
increase behavioral intentions. Fear inducing messages must be combined
with messages to increase self-and response efficacy. Education is also
not the only piece of the puzzle. Students state difficulty in
performing some sustainable behaviors as a key barrier, indicating a
need to incorporate infrastructure changes at campuses to facilitate
greater ease among students to act sustainably.
Originality value - This study tests the EPPM's utility in helping to
find the most effective ways to influence college students' future
behavioral intentions toward acting sustainably.

N2  - BackgroundPrimary care physicians (PCPs) are essential for healthcare
delivery but can be difficult to recruit to health research. Low
response rates may impact the quality and value of data collected. This
paper outlines participant and study design factors associated with
increased response rates among PCPs invited to participate in a
qualitative study at Sydney Children's Hospital, Australia.
ProcedureWe invited 160 PCPs by post, who were nominated by their
childhood cancer patients in a survey study. We followed-up by
telephone, email, or fax 2weeks later.
ResultsWithout any follow-up, 32 PCPs opted in to the study. With
follow-up, a further 42 PCPs opted in, with email appearing to be the
most effective method, yielding a total of 74 PCPs opting in (46.3%).
We reached data saturation after 51 interviews. On average, it took 34.6
days from mail-out to interview completion. Nonrespondents were more
likely to be male (P=0.013). No survivor-related factors significantly
influenced PCPs' likelihood of participating. Almost double the number
of interviews were successfully completed if scheduled via email versus
phone. Those requiring no follow-up did not differ significantly to late
respondents in demographic/survivor-related characteristics.
ConclusionPCP factors associated with higher opt in rates, and early
responses, may be of interest to others considering engaging PCPs and/or
their patients in cancer-related research, particularly qualitative or
mixed-methods studies. Study resources may be best allocated to email
follow-up, incentives, and personalization of study documents linking
PCPs to patients. These efforts may improve PCP participation and the
representativeness of study findings.

N2  - This paper analyses doctors' supply of after-hours care (AHC), and how
it is affected by personal and family circumstances as well as the
earnings structure. We use detailed survey data from a large sample of
Australian General Practitioners (GPs) to estimate a structural,
discrete choice model of labour supply and AHC. This allows us to
jointly model GPs' decisions on the number of daytime-weekday working
hours and the probability of providing AHC. We simulate GPs' labour
supply responses to an increase in hourly earnings, both in a
daytime-weekday setting and for AHC. GPs increase their daytime-weekday
working hours if their hourly earnings in this setting increase, but
only to a very small extent. GPs are somewhat more likely to provide AHC
if their hourly earnings in that setting increase, but again, the effect
is very small and only evident in some subgroups. Moreover, higher
earnings in weekday-daytime practice reduce the probability of providing
AHC, particularly for men. Increasing GPs' earnings appears to be at
best relatively ineffective in encouraging increased provision of AHC
and may even prove harmful if incentives are not well targeted.

N2  - With proliferation of web surveys, the relative affordability of
recruitment, and increasing nonresponse in other survey modes,
nonprobability methods are increasingly being considered by researchers
and government offices alike. However, research needs to more fully
understand how the demographic characteristics of respondents may depend
heavily on the source of sample, mode of recruitment, and context of the
survey experience. As a first step in exploring the potential
implications of recruitment source on response quality, we use data from
a web survey fielded in 2013 to compare data quality indicators in
survey data from the two recruitment platforms (Google and Facebook
advertisements). In so doing, taking into account demographic
differences that may arise from various steps in the recruitment
process, we explore the effect of demographics, device and technology
usage, incentives, and recruitment platform on data quality and response
strategy. Our results show differences between platforms in
comparability to national benchmarks, breakoffs, completion time,
nonsubstantive answers, and numeric response strategies. Importantly,
some variation in substantive responses was explained by demographic
differences related to mobile device usage, which varied by recruitment
platform. With the use of nonprobability samples on the rise, future
work should build from these results to more directly assess the role of
recruitment source in data quality.

select the main factors of influence. In order to meet this goal, we
have drawn from the surveys conducted by PwC (Bratislava, Slovakia), the
Automobile Industry Association and the Slovak Automobile Institute to
identify key factors and future expected development in the auto
industry supplier segment and our marketing research, conducted from
December 2015 to February 2016. Based on the results of marketing
surveys, research responses and the study of available resources, we
concluded that there is no comprehensive green marketing implementation
model linking environmental consumer behavior with a link to the
company's marketing strategy. The contribution could help the Automotive
Industry Union to present requirements to the government and help create
incentives for the alternative vehicle market, and our findings could be
incorporated into the creation of companies' strategy.

that academic researchers ought to make greater use of campus employees
for survey experiments. For applications where a representative sample
is unattainable and student samples provide too little variation on key
characteristics, staff members provide an inexpensive alternative that
offers greater statistical leverage and the ability to detect
conditional treatment effects
MethodsUsing an e-mail survey experiment conducted on employees at a
large public university, we explore how two modest incentives for
participation affect the quantity and quality of responses.
ResultsWhile overall differences among conditions are modest, a cash
lottery generates somewhat higher response rates with little effect on
sociodemographic skew or level of satisficing. The condition offering a
charitable contribution fared worse on both counts.
ConclusionUniversity employees provide a convenient, heterogeneous, and
inexpensive population for experimental studies.

information technology (61%). Limitations of this study include that
information was self-reported by ED directors, a focus limited to
Massachusetts, and a survey response rate of 47%.& para;&
para;Conclusion: The ED directors perceived that the majority of
physicians were not familiar with accountable care organization goals,
many challenges remain in coordinating care for patients in the ED, and
most EDs have no financial incentives tied to accountable care
organizations. EDs in Massachusetts have begun to implement strategies
aimed at reducing admissions, utilization, and overall cost, but these
strategies are not widespread apart from case management, even in a
state with heavy accountable care organization penetration. Our results
suggest that Massachusetts EDs still lack clear directives and direct

N2  - ObjectivesResponse rates to health-related surveys are declining. This
study tested two strategies to improve the response rate to a health
psychology survey mailed through English general practices: (1) sending
a shortened questionnaire and (2) offering a monetary incentive to
return a completed questionnaire.
DesignRandomized controlled trial.
MethodsAdults (n=4,241) aged 45-59years, from four General Practices in
South-East England, were mailed a survey on attitudes towards bowel
cancer screening. Using a 2x4 factorial design, participants were
randomized to receive a short' (four A4 pages) or a long' (seven A4
pages) questionnaire, and one of four monetary incentives to return a
completed questionnaire - (1) no monetary incentive, (2) 2.50 shop
voucher, (3) 5.00 shop voucher, and (4) inclusion in a 250 shop voucher
prize draw. Age, gender, and area-level deprivation were obtained from
the General Practices.
ResultsThe overall response rate was 41% (n=1,589). Response to the
short' questionnaire (42%) was not significantly different from the
long' questionnaire (40%). The 2.50 incentive (43%) significantly
improved response rates in univariate analyses, and remained significant
after controlling for age, gender, area-level deprivation, and
questionnaire length. The 5.00 (42%) and 250 prize draw (41%)
incentives had no significant impact on response rates compared to no
incentive (38%).
ConclusionsA small monetary incentive (2.50) may slightly increase
response to a mailed health psychology survey. The length of the
questionnaire (four pages vs. seven pages) did not influence response.
Although frequently used, entry into a prize draw did not increase
response. Achieving representative samples remains a challenge for
health psychology.

N2  - Background: The hypothesis is that decision-making for transfusion
varies considerably among gastroenterologists. The aim is to identify
preferences and predictors of transfusion decision-making in chronic
anemia.
Study design and methods: Between February and April of 2015, a
computerized adaptive choice-based conjoint survey was administered to
gastroenterologists in the Netherlands. The survey included seven
patient attributes: hemoglobin levels, hemoglobin stability, age, iron
indices, the presence of anemia-related symptoms, cardiovascular
comorbidities, and the number of transfusions in the past half year.
Predictors of transfusion preferences were assessed by multivariable
regression.
Results: 113 gastroenterologists completed the survey (response
rate=29%; mean age=47 years; 24% women). Absolute hemoglobin level was
the most important incentive of transfusion, accounting for 42% of
decision-making, followed by age (15%), hemoglobin stability (12%),
anemia-related symptoms (10%), and cardiovascular comorbidities (10%).
A hemoglobin level > 9.6g/dL is an inflection point, where
gastroenterologists would not prescribe transfusions. Age of the patient
is more important in the decision-making process to younger
gastroenterologists (OR -2.9, 95% CI -5.3 to -0.5).
Conclusion: Absolute hemoglobin level is the most important factor to
transfusion decision-making. This is contradictory to transfusion
guidelines for chronic anemia which address the importance of symptoms.

N2  - This study investigates potential bias that may arise when surveys
include question items for which multiple units are elicited. Examples
of such items include questions about experiences with multiple health
centers, comparison of different products, or the solicitation of
egocentric network data. The larger the number of items asked about each
named individual or location, the greater potential interviewer and
respondent burden accrues to the naming of more names. Interviewers may
be inclined to limit the number of names elicited to reduce the amount
of time required to complete the interviews. We tested whether such bias
occurred from data collected in northwest Ghana by contrasting group
learning with individual learning. The results provided mixed evidence
for both group and individual learning and stress the need to take
actions such as increased training, change in incentives, and/or
monitoring responses to guard against such results.

N2  - Building energy flexibility might play a crucial role in demand side
management for integrating intermittent renewables into smart grids. The
potential of building energy flexibility depends not only on the
physical characteristics of a building but also on occupant behaviour in
the building. Building users will have to adopt smart technologies and
to change their daily energy use behaviours or routines, if energy
flexibility is to be achieved. The willingness of users to make changes
will determine how much demand flexibility can be achieved in buildings
and whether energy flexible buildings can be realized. This will have a
considerable impact on the transition to smart grids. This study is thus
to assess the perception of smart grids and energy flexible buildings by
building users, and their readiness for them on a large scale. We
attempted to identify the key characteristics of the ideal user of
flexible buildings. A questionnaire was designed and administered as an
online survey in the Netherlands. The questionnaire consisted of
questions about the sociodemographic characteristics of the current
users, house type, household composition, current energy use behaviour,
willingness to use smart technologies, and willingness to change energy
use behaviour. The survey was completed by 835 respondents, of which 785
(94%) were considered to have provided a genuine response. Our analysis
showed that the concept of smart grids is an unfamiliar one, as more
than 60% of the respondents had never heard of smart grids. However,
unfamiliarity with smart grids increased with age, and half of the
respondents aged 20-29 years old were aware of the concept. Monetary
incentives were identified as the biggest motivating factor for adoption
of smart grid technologies. It was also found that people would be most
in favour of acquiring smart dishwashers (65% of the respondents) and
refrigerator/freezers (60%). Statistical analysis shows that people who
are willing to use smart technologies are also willing to change their
behaviour, and can thus be categorised as potentially flexible building
users. Given certain assumptions, 11% of the respondents were found to
be potentially flexible building users. To encourage people to be
prepared for energy flexible buildings, awareness of smart grids will
have to be increased, and the adoption of smart technologies may have to
be promoted by providing incentives such as financial rewards. (C) 2017

N2  - Objective: To describe the design, implementation, and consumer response
to a coupon-style intervention aimed to increase Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program (SNAP) use at a farmers' market (FM) among Temporary
Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) participants.
Design: A quasi-experimental trial to evaluate redemption response to 2
coupon interventions; baseline surveys characterized coupon redeemers
and non-redeemers.
Setting: Urban.
Participants: The TANF recipients were assigned to either a plain (n =
124) or targeted marketing coupon intervention (n = 130).
Intervention(s): Both groups received 10 $2 coupons to double fruit and
vegetable SNAP purchases at the FM. The targeted marketing group also
received an oral presentation designed to reduce perceived barriers to
FM use.
Main Outcome Measure: Coupon redemption.
Analysis: The researchers used t tests and chi-square/Fisher exact tests
to examine associations between redeemers and non-redeemers; logistic
regression was used to adjust for the intervention.
Results: No male and few female participants redeemed coupons (6.3%).
Among women, those with knowledge of vegetable preparation were 3 times
more likely to redeem coupons than were those with little or no
knowledge (odds ratio = 3.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-13.77).
Conclusions and Implications: Stand-alone coupon incentive programs may
not be a high-reach strategy for encouraging FM use among the population
using TANF. Complementary strategies to build vegetable preparation
knowledge and skills are needed.

perceive events' social media presence. An online qualitative survey was
conducted with sport fans (n = 105) of four professional tennis events
(Australian Open, Roland Garros, Wimbledon, and U.S. Open). Findings
suggest that fans perceive the events' usage of social media to be about
three aspects: interaction, insight, and brand anthropomorphism. In
addition, fan responses suggest that while Facebook is the most popular
site for general social media usage, these fans consider Twitter to be
their most preferred platform to follow the events. Finally, fan
responses illustrate three barriers that brands need to overcome in
order to successfully develop and execute their social media strategy:
competition with other media, a lack of yearround incentives, and
technological capabilities of the platforms, which ultimately influenced
fans' motives and use.

N2  - Those examining climate compatible development and triple-win policy
efforts that simultaneously negotiate sustainable development, climate
change mitigation, and climate change adaptation considerations are on
the cutting edge of exploring why and how policymakers address complex
social problems that require balancing considerations about multiple,
interrelated policy issues. Enhancing understanding of factors
underlying the emergence of these efforts can help strengthen incentives
for action, address implementation challenges, and anticipate
inequities. This paper uses survey responses from 287 cities and
logistic regression analyses to explore conditions and policy actions
associated with potential climate compatible development efforts when
economic development, sustainability, climate change mitigation, and
climate change adaptation considerations overlap. It finds evidence that
potential climate compatible development efforts were present in 10% of
the cities studied. Adaptation was the issue most likely to act as the
missing link when each of these other issues influenced city policy
actions, and mitigation was the least likely. Contextual factors
associated with these efforts included budget stress, leadership from a
policy entrepreneur, higher college degree attainment rates, having an
environmental department or commission, and the area of the city
composed of water versus land. Examining factors associated with these
issues acting as missing links revealed contradictions that highlight
the necessity of further exploration of processes affecting the pursuit
of climate compatible development.

N2  - To mitigate the potentially harmful effects of nonresponse, most surveys
repeatedly follow up with nonrespondents, often targeting a response
rate or predetermined number of completes. Each additional recruitment
attempt generally brings in a new wave of data, but returns gradually
diminish over the course of a fixed data collection protocol, as each
subsequent wave tends to consist of fewer responses than the last.
Consequently, point estimates begin to stabilize. This is the notion of
phase capacity, suggesting some form of design change is in order, such
as switching modes, increasing the incentive, or, as is considered
exclusively in this research, discontinuing the nonrespondent follow-up
campaign altogether. A previously proposed test for phase capacity calls
for multiply imputing nonrespondents' missing data to assess,
retrospectively, whether the most recent wave of data significantly
altered a key, nonresponse-adjusted point estimate. This study
introduces a more flexible adaptation amenable to surveys that instead
reweight the observed data to compensate for nonresponse. Results from a
simulation study and application indicate that, all else equal, the
weighting version of the test is more sensitive to point estimate
changes, thereby dictating more follow-up attempts are warranted.

N2  - One objective of adaptive data collection is to secure a better balanced
survey response. Methods exist for this purpose, including balancing
with respect to selected auxiliary variables. Such variables are also
used at the estimation stage for (calibrated) nonresponse weighting
adjustment.
Earlier research has shown that the use of auxiliary information at the
estimation stage can reduce bias, perhaps considerably, but without
eliminating it. The question is: would it have contributed further to
bias reduction if, prior to estimation, that information had also been
used in data collection, to secure a more balanced set of respondents?
If the answer is yes, there is clear incentive, from the point of view
of better accuracy in the estimates, to practice adaptive survey design,
otherwise perhaps not.
A key question is how the regression relationship between the survey
variable and the auxiliary vector presents itself in the sample as
opposed to the response. Strength in the relationship is helpful but is
not the only consideration. The dilemma with nonresponse is one of
inconsistent regression: a regression model appropriate for the sample
often fails for the responding subset, because nonresponse is selective,
non-random.
In this article, we examine how nonresponse bias in survey estimates
depends on regression inconsistency, both seen as functions of response
imbalance. As a measure of bias we use the deviation of the calibration
adjusted estimator from the unbiased estimate under full response. We
study how the deviation and the regression inconsistency depend on the
imbalance. We observe in empirical work that both can be reduced, to a
degree, by efforts to reduce imbalance by an adaptive data collection.

N2  - Survey researchers have been investigating alternative approaches to
reduce data collection costs while mitigating the risk of nonresponse
bias or to produce more accurate estimates within the same budget.
Responsive or adaptive design has been suggested as one means for doing
this. Falling survey response rates and the need to find effective ways
of implementing responsive design has focused attention on the
relationship between response rates and nonresponse bias. In our
article, we re-examine the data compiled by Groves and Peytcheva (2008)
in their influential article and show there is an important
between-study component of variance in addition to the within-study
variance highlighted in the original analysis. We also show that theory
implies that raising response rates can help reduce the nonresponse bias
on average across the estimates within a study. We then propose a
typology of response propensity models that help explain the empirical
findings, including the relative weak relationship between nonresponse
rates and nonresponse bias. Using these results, we explore when
responsive design tools such as switching modes, giving monetary
incentives, and increasing the level of effort are likely to be
effective. We conclude with some comments on the use of responsive
design and weighting to control nonresponse bias.

of adults in high-income areas of the United States. Monetary incentives
were randomly assigned: $ 5 prepaid incentive and notification
postcard, or no prepaid incentive and no postcard. In addition, promised
incentives were much greater in value than are typically offered by
surveys: $ 50, $ 100, or $ 150 upon completion of the survey. The
study analyzes the effect of variation in these incentives on unit
response, including respondent- initiated phone calls to complete the

We find that prepaid incentives increased respondent-initiated phone
interviews and the overall response rate and that $ 100 and $ 150
promised incentives both increased response rates relative to the $ 50

Oncology and Palliative Care (PC) Incentive Programme has grown
steadily. We aimed to characterise the level of PC clinical services,
education and research at ESMO-DCs.
Methods: We sent all 184 ESMO-DCs an electronic survey consisting of 78
questions examining the DC characteristics, palliative care clinical
programme (structure, processes, and outcomes), primary PC delivery by
oncologists, education, research and attitudes and beliefs towards the
ESMO-DC programme.
Results: The response rate was 83% (152/184). 115 (76%) ESMO-DCs were
from Europe, 87 (57%) were tertiary care centres. 136 (90%) had
inpatient consultation teams, 135 (89%) had outpatient PC clinics, 107
(71%) had dedicated acute care beds, and 75 (50%) offered
community-based PC. An estimated 70% (interquartile range {[}IQR]
28-80%) of patients with advanced cancer had a PC consultation before
death, occurring 90 days before death (median, IQR 40-150 days) for
outpatients and 21 days (IQR 1445 days) for inpatients. 59 (39%)
offered PC fellowship programme; 47 (32%) had mandatory PC rotations
for oncology fellows. Ninety-nine (65%) had double-boarded palliative
oncologists. 118 (78%) of the ESMO-DCs reported that routine symptom
screening was offered in the oncology clinic and 30% of patients had
documented end-of-life discussions by their oncologists. Most centres
(>80%) perceived the ESMO-DC programme to increase their status.
Conclusions: The ESMO-DCs had a high level of PC infrastructure and
provided access to a large proportion of patients with advanced cancer.
The survey supports that the 13 criteria required for ESMO designation
set a robust framework for integration, stimulated investment of
resources into some palliative care programmes prior to accreditation,
and raised the interest about palliative care among clinicians, trainees
and patients.

N2  - The identification and treatment of protest responses in stated
preference surveys has long been subject to debate. We analyse protest
responses while investigating ecosystem services providers' preferences
for incentive-based schemes. We use a choice experiment for olive
farmers' preferences for agri-environmental scheme participation in
southern Spain. Our two main objectives are: first, to identify and
discuss a range of possible motives for protest responses that emerge in
a WTA context; second, we analyse the impact on WTA estimates of
censoring serial non-participation linked to protest or high
compensation requirements (very high takers). Using a random parameter
logit model in WTA space, we find that the inclusion or exclusion of
serial non-participants in the analysis can have a significant impact on
marginal and total WTA estimates. Based on the findings, the paper makes
recommendations on how to reduce the incidence of protest responses
through survey design, regarding the identification of protesters as
opposed to very high takers, and regarding the treatment of both groups
of respondents for WTA estimation.

late, in the project delivery process. A mixed-method research approach
sequentially combined nonparametric statistical analyses of survey
responses to quantify the influence of behaviors on predictability and
research charrettes with subject matter experts to assess the findings
and characterize practical applications. Multiple behavioral factors,
such as those associated with the design of incentives or the reporting
environment, were documented to have a significant effect on
predictability. This study contributes with a novel combination of

N2  - Loss of natural heritage is a problem that is particularly prevalent in
areas of high population density. We used a survey to understand the
factors that drive environmental behavior of landowners in southwestern
Ontario, Canada. The survey, which contained questions about
environmental attitude, pro-environmental behavior and demographics, was
mailed to 18,090 rural route addresses, and we received 3256 completed
surveys (18% response rate). Two types of environmental behavior,
namely voluntarily increasing the area of land set aside for
conservation, and enrollment in a conservation stewardship program, were
significantly correlated with a positive attitude towards conservation.
Financial considerations also played a role. We showed that the biggest
motivator to enroll in a wetland enhancement program was access to `more
information on how the decline in wetland area affects them personally',
while `public recognition' was the least motivating factor. We suggest
that enrollment in voluntary land stewardship programs might be
increased by providing information about the effects of ecosystem loss,
and by providing financial incentives for participation. In a larger
social context, outreach programs by government agencies could focus on
improving pro-environmental attitudes, which in turn is likely to result
in more pro-environmental behavior of landowners.

N2  - Authorship of peer-reviewed journal articles and abstracts has become
the primary currency and reward unit in academia. Such a reward is
crucial for students and postdocs who are often under-compensated and
thus highly value authorship as an incentive. While numerous scientific
and publishing organizations have written guidelines for determining
author qualifications and author order, there remains much ambiguity
when it comes to how these criteria are weighed by research faculty.
Here, we sought to provide some initial insight on how faculty view the
relative importance of 11 criteria for scientific authorship. We
distributed an online survey to 564 biomedical engineering, biology, and
bioengineering faculty members at 10 research institutions across the
United States. The response rate was approximately 18%,resulting in a
final sample of 102 respondents. Results revealed an agreement on some
criteria, such as time spent conducting experiments, but there was a
lack of agreement regarding the role of funding procurement. This study
provides quantitative assessments of how faculty members in the
biosciences evaluate authorship criteria. We discuss the implications of
these findings for researchers, especially new graduate students, to
help navigate the discrepancy between official policies for authorship
and the contributions that faculty truly value.

N2  - ObjectivesThe present study aimed to determine major factors that
influence blood donation in China.
BackgroundFactors affecting blood donation often vary in various
populations.
MethodsThis cross-sectional study used self-administered, standardised,
structured questionnaires to survey selected donors and non-donors in
Guangzhou, China between 10 December 2013 and 25 June 2014.
ResultsAmong the 1080 questionnaires collected, 1034 (957%)
questionnaires were valid for this analysis, including 602 donors and
432 non-donors. Results revealed that helping patients (n = 405, 682%)
was the main objective of blood donation, and self-perception of poor
health (n = 138, 331%) was the main reason for not donating. Responses
to questions raised by donors and inquiring about a donor's physical
condition were thought to be the most important blood donation routines
(n = 302, 655%). For non-donors, 903% (n = 390) expressed their
intention to donate blood in the future, and usage of blood (n = 182,
467%) was the most asked question. Prepaid cellular phone cards were
the most popular incentives. Raising the awareness of blood donation was
the most effective way of enhancing blood donation programmes, and
television ads and the internet were the most effective means.
ConclusionHelping patients was the main objective of blood donation in
China. However, self-perception of poor health was a major barrier to
donating blood. Raising the awareness of blood donation in combination
with multiple aspects of campaigns that target different populations
with potential blood donors is critical. Television and the internet are
the most effective tools for promotion of and recruitment for blood
donation.

N2  - Objectives: This study investigates student and stakeholder perceptions
of the role of the dental hygienist in Nepal. The impact of these
perceptions on the professionalization of dental hygienists is described
whilst exploring the consequences for oral health workforce planning.
Methods: Dentistry and dental hygiene students from one dental college
in Nepal were asked to complete an anonymous questionnaire; 171 students
returned the questionnaire containing a mix of forced response and
open-ended items. Quantitative data were analysed using SPSS (R) 22.
These data were complemented with qualitative information from survey
open questions and from semi-structured interviews with key informants
from several relevant organizations. Qualitative data were manually
analysed and coded. Data were triangulated to contextualize quantitative
data. Results: A high level of positive regard for the role of the
dental hygienist in Nepal was evident amongst dentistry and dental
hygiene students in this college. Both groups believe that the dental
hygienist can play a major role in raising oral health awareness in
Nepal. The scope of practice of the dental hygienist was unclear with
issues surrounding the scope of practice and reports of illegal practice
by dental hygienists. Significant differences (P < 0.001) were noted
between dental hygiene and dentistry students in relation to their
opinion regarding independent practice and the need of supervision by a
dentist. Discussion and conclusion: Supervision of the dental hygienist
by dentists and issues surrounding the scope of practice are polarizing
the relationship between dentists, dental hygienists and the relevant
professional organizations. This could hinder cooperation between these
oral health professionals and might lead to underutilization of the
dental hygienist. To improve the understanding about the roles of each
oral health professional, establishing functional relationships and
intraprofessional education involving dentistry and dental hygiene
students needs to be introduced. This will benefit the introduction of
preventative oral health services in Nepal. Government jobs and
incentives to increase the retention and distribution of oral health
professionals should be created. The government and professional
organizations need to consider professionalizing the dental hygiene
workforce and formalize the scope of practice. The unique demographic
details of Nepal require a paradigm shift in oral health workforce
management in Nepal.

Methods: Stratified randomized sampling was used to invite a
representative number of NPs from each state to participate in a 2015
survey and a follow-up survey in 2016. These descriptive, exploratory
studies distributed electronic questionnaires to 5000 randomly selected
NPs in the 2015 survey and 40,000 NPs in the 2016 survey. Responses from
10.9% (n = 548) and 9.9% (n = 3970), respectively, were analyzed.
Conclusions: The findings show strong support among our NP colleagues to
assist with educating future NPs. Several benefits, barriers, and
motivators among stakeholders were identified that need to be considered
when working with preceptors.

N2  - After a period of steady decline, out-of-pocket (OOP) costs for general
practitioner (GP) consultations in Australia began increasing in the
mid-1990s. Following the rising community concerns about the increasing
costs, the Australian Government introduced the Strengthening Medicare
reforms in 2004 and 2005, which included a targeted incentive for GPs to
charge zero OOP costs for consultations provided to children and
concession cardholders (older adults and the poor), as well as an
increase in the reimbursement for all GP visits. This paper examines the
impact of those reforms using longitudinal survey and administrative
data from a large national sample of women. The findings suggest that
the reforms were effective in reducing OOP costs by an average of
$A0.40 per visit. Decreases in OOP costs, however, were not evenly
distributed. Those with higher pre-reform OOP costs had the biggest
reductions in OOP costs, as did those with concession cards. However,
results also reveal increases in OOP costs for most people without a
concession card. The analysis suggests that there has been considerable
heterogeneity in GP responses to the reforms, which has led to
substantial changes in the fees charged by doctors and, as a result, the
OOP costs incurred by different population groups. Copyright (c) 2016

N2  - Background: Patients on chronic warfarin therapy require regular
laboratory monitoring to safely manage warfarin. Recent studies have
challenged the need for routine monthly blood draws in the most stable
warfarin-treated patients, suggesting the safety of less frequent
laboratory testing (up to every 12 weeks). De-implementation efforts aim
to reduce the use of low-value clinical practices. To explore barriers
and facilitators of a de-implementation effort to reduce the use of
frequent laboratory tests for patients with stable warfarin management
in nurse/ pharmacist-run anticoagulation clinics, we performed a
mixed-methods study conducted within a state-wide collaborative quality
improvement collaborative.
Methods: Using a mixed-methods approach, we conducted
post-implementation semi-structured interviews with a total of eight
anticoagulation nurse or pharmacist staff members at five participating
clinic sites to assess barriers and facilitators to de-implementing
frequent international normalized ratio (INR) laboratory testing among
patients with stable warfarin control. Interview guides were based on
the Tailored Implementation for Chronic Disease (TICD) framework.
Informed by interview themes, a survey was developed and administered to
all anticoagulation clinical staff (n = 62) about their self-reported
utilization of less frequent INR testing and specific barriers to
de-implementing the standard (more frequent) INR testing practice.
Results: From the interviews, four themes emerged congruent with TICD
domains: (1) staff overestimating their actual use of less frequent INR
testing (individual health professional factors), (2) barriers to
appropriate patient engagement (incentives and resources), (3) broad
support for an electronic medical record flag to identify potentially
eligible patients (incentives and resources), and (4) the importance of
personalized nurse/ pharmacist feedback (individual health professional
factors). In the survey (65% response rate), staff report offering less
frequent INR testing to 56% (46-66%) of eligible patients. Most survey
responders (n = 24; 60%) agreed that an eligibility flag in the
electronic medical record would be very helpful. Twenty-four (60%)
respondents agreed that periodic, personalized feedback on use of less
frequent INR testing would also be helpful.
Conclusions: Leveraging information system notifications, reducing
additional work load burden for participating patients and providers,
and providing personalized feedback are strategies that may improve
adoption and utilization new policies in anticoagulation clinics that
focus on de-implementation.

N2  - Farm businesses face increasing challenges in the face of policy reform
which envisages multifunctional rural economies with objectives which
span the environmental, the social as well as the production of food.
This leads to uncertainties and ambiguities in the way in which farms
respond to incentives and pressures to become entrepreneurial, to
diversify, to become more efficient at food production and to adopt new
technology. This paper examines these tensions in the context of upland
agricultural business in rural Wales. Qualitative and quantitative
results support a conclusion of significant heterogeneity in farm
response, and highlight tensions between maintaining a focus towards
current on-farm activity or pursuing entrepreneurial diversification, as
well as differing levels of technology adoption in support of these
income streams. Supported by a descriptive cluster analysis based on
survey data, the paper proposes a new conceptual categorisation of
entrepreneurial strategy, distinguished on the basis of attitudes
towards on- and off-farm income generation and on stated stance towards
current and future policy grant streams. The paper discusses some of the
factors that may determine how particular farmers and farming businesses
lie within this categorisation. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by

N2  - Involving local stakeholders in monitoring has the potential to
stimulate learning and improve management responses. However, there is
limited understanding about factors which influence implementation and
success. This paper reviews local stakeholders' perceptions with respect
to the construction of longitudinal dams in the Dutch river Waal, and
explores their incentives to be involved in monitoring the effects of
this intervention. Interviews with key stakeholders showed that concerns
and (dis)trust are important incentives for participating in monitoring.
Surveys of local residents, recreational anglers and boaters, and
shipping professionals mapped their level of trust, attachment to the
river landscape and evaluation of the effects of the longitudinal dams.
Our case study shows that incentives for participation differ between
stakeholder groups, and that research into their perceptions of the
local environment can inform water managers on how to involve these
groups in participatory monitoring. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

N2  - Due to the increasing amount of electronic waste (e-waste) generated in
Nigeria, challenges such as consumer disposal behaviors have emerged. An
understanding of consumers' intentions to participate in formal e-waste
collections is key in increasing the level of participation in an
e-waste collection scheme. The theory of planned behavior (TPB) creates
an applicable platform for identifying the determinants of recycling
intention. Based on the TPB, we develop a theoretical framework to study
how influencing factors such as attitude, subjective norm, perceived
behavioral control and environmental knowledge influence intentions to
participate in formal e-waste collections. Additionally, we extend the
research framework to examine whether the factors of infrastructure and
economic incentive moderate the relationships between the influencing
factors and intention. Using an empirical survey conducted in Onitsha
with 384 usable questionnaire responses, we observe that attitude,
subjective norm, and environmental knowledge directly influence
consumers' intentions. Statistical results also show that only the
factor of infrastructure moderates the relationship between two
influencing factors (attitude and subjective norm) and intention. The
resulting negative coefficients of regression for the interactions
indicate that the introduction of infrastructure will result in a weaker
influencing ability of attitude and subjective norm on intention. Thus,
the implications of this study in motivating consumers' intentions
suggest it would be beneficial for the government to provide functional
and adequately managed infrastructure situated close to the community,
such that it can be easily accessed by household consumers.

N2  - In this article, we analyse the effect of an incentive experiment on
German consumers' recording behaviour on the basis of a one-week diary
of their point-of-sale expenditure. Part of the experiment, which was
carried out shortly before the consumers began filling in their payment
diaries, involved consumers rolling a die with a chance of winning
either EUR 20 or nothing, that is, they were randomly assigned an
incentive. We ask whether respondents' recording behaviour differs
depending on whether individuals win or lose. We argue that winners
attach a more positive feeling to the survey than losers and therefore
show a stronger commitment to the diary. As the incentive experiment is
part of a larger experiment to elicit respondents' risk preferences, we
also provide evidence on the effect of conducting up-front behavioural
experiments in representative surveys. Our results indicate that the
outcome of the lottery (rolling of the die) has an impact on the
quantity of transactions recorded, but does not affect other aspects of
respondents' recording behaviour, such as item nonresponse or rounding.
It also has a negligible impact on substantive measures, such as the
cash share.

N2  - Tropical land use is one of the leading causes of global environmental
change. Sustainable agricultural development aims to reduce the negative
environmental impacts of tropical land use whilst enhancing the
well-being of the smallholder farmers residing in those areas.
Interventions with this goal are typically designed by scientists
educated in the Western tradition, and often achieve lower than desired
uptake by smallholder farmers. We build on work done in farm type
classification and studies of factors that influence adaptation,
trialling a suite of household survey questions to elucidate the
motivational factors that influence a farmer's willingness to adapt to
external change. Based on a sample of 1015 households in the rubber
growing region of Xishuangbanna, South-west China, we found that farm
types based on structural characteristics (e.g. crops, livelihoods)
could not be used to accurately predict farmers' motivations to adapt.
Amongst all six farm types identified, the full range of motivational
typologies was found. We found six motivational types, from most to
least likely to adapt, named: Aspirational Innovators, Conscientious,
Copy Cats, Incentive-centric, Well Settled, and Change Resistant. These
groups roughly corresponded with those identified in literature
regarding diffusion of innovations, but such classifications are rarely
used in development literature. We predict that only one third of the
population would be potentially willing to trial a new intervention, and
recommend that those sectors of the population should be identified and
preferentially targeted by development programs. Such an approach
requires validation that these motivational typologies accurately
predict real behaviour perhaps through a panel survey approach.
Dedicated data gathering is required, beyond what is usually carried out
for ex-ante farm typologies, but with some refinements of the
methodology presented here the process need not be onerous. An improved
suite of questions to appraise farmers' motivations might include value
orientations, life satisfaction, and responses to various scenarios, all
phrased to be locally appropriate, with a scoring system that uses the
full range of potential scores and a minimum of follow up and peripheral
questions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Automated Internet intervention studies have generally had
large dropout rates for follow-up assessments. Live phone follow-ups
have been often used to increase follow-up completion rates.
Objective: To compare, via a randomized study, whether receiving phone
calls improves follow-up rates beyond email reminders and financial
incentives in a depression prevention study.
Method: A sample of 95 participants (63 English-speakers and 32
Spanish-speakers) was recruited online to participate in a ``Healthy
Mood{''} study. Consented participants were randomized to either a Call
or a No Call condition. All participants were sent up to three email
reminders in one week at 1, 3, and 6 months after consent, and all
participants received monetary incentives to complete the surveys. Those
in the Call condition received up to ten follow-up phone calls if they
did not complete the surveys in response to email reminders.
Results: The follow-up rates for Call vs. No Call conditions at 1, 3,
and 6 months, respectively, were as follows: English speakers, 58.6%
vs. 52.9%, 62.1% vs. 52.9%, and 68.9% vs. 47.1%; Spanish speakers,
50.0% vs. 35.7%, 33.3% vs. 21.4%, and 33.3% vs. 7.1%. The number
of participants who completed follow-up assessments only after being
called at 1-, 3- and 6 months was 2 (14.3%), 0 (0%), and 3 (25.0%)
for English speakers, and 2 (18.9%), 0 (0%), and 1 (7.7%) for Spanish
speakers. The number of phone calls made to achieve one completed
follow-up was 58.8 in the English sample and 57.7 and Spanish-speaking
sample.
Conclusions: Adding phone call contacts to email reminders and monetary
incentives did increase follow-up rates. However, the rate of response
to follow-up was low and the number of phone calls required to achieve
one completed follow-up raises concerns about the utility of adding
phone calls. We also discuss difficulties with using financial
incentives and their implications. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by

N2  - This essay focuses on the impact of recent changes in corporate
governance on ethical behaviour within the public corporation. It argues
that a style of corporate behaviour-one characterized by a risk
tolerant, even reckless, pursuit of short-term profits and a disregard
for the interests of non-shareholder constituencies-is attributable in
significant part to recent changes in corporate governance, including
the rise of hedge fund activism, greater use of incentive compensation,
and the appearance of blockholder directors. This trend will only be
accelerated by the election of Donald Trump as President of the United
States, because the consensus view is that `tone at the top' is a
critical factor in shaping law compliance and business ethics within
corporations. This essay then surveys feasible responses intended to
strengthen the role of the board as the corporation's conscience and
superego. Given the difficulty of reform, it predicts that the problems
identified are likely to get worse before they get better.

N2  - To maximize the representativeness of results from surveys, coverage,
sampling, nonresponse, measurement, and analysis errors must be
minimized. Although not a cure-all, one approach for mitigating
nonresponse errors is to maximize cooperation rates. In this study,
personalizing mailings, token financial incentives, and the use of real
stamps were tested for their impacts on cooperation rates for family
forest owners asked to participate in the U.S. Forest Service's National
Woodland Owner Survey in the state of Connecticut. Token financial
incentives, a two-dollar bill included in the first questionnaire
mailing, significantly increased cooperation rates by 13 percentage
points. Neither personalization nor real stamps showed significant
impacts on cooperation rates. While these results are for just one state
in the USA, we hypothesize that similar patterns would be observed in
other states and likely other countries.

N2  - This paper argues that some women in developing countries use domestic
labor as a tool to incentivize husbands. A theoretical model is derived
based on the traditions of rural Malawi, where men often supplement farm
income with wage labor. As wage labor is not observed by the wife, this
creates moral hazard: husbands may not make enough effort to bring home
wages. The model predicts that women overcome this by using domestic
labor as an incentive device: they increase their domestic labor and
reduce their leisure in response to good consumption outcomes, but only
if they cannot rely on divorce threat as an alternative source of
incentives. This prediction is confirmed using survey data from Malawi.
Identification is based on the fact that Malawi's kinship traditions
exogenously determine women's accessibility to divorce. Where divorce is
not an option, women make inefficient labor choices in order to provide
incentives.

N2  - Early childhood educators worldwide all strive to improve the quality of
care and education for young children through sustainable pathways. One
such pathway is professional development (PD). In the United States,
ongoing PD has been recognized as critical to enhancing practitioners'
professional competence. Situated within the broader context of early
childhood professional development systems, this study examined the New
Jersey Infant/Toddler Credential (NJITC) as a case of PD. Specifically,
we evaluated the effectiveness of the NJITC as PD by investigating its
process as well as impact on the participating practitioners'
professional growth and practice from multiple perspectives: written
reflections from a course instructor and a childcare center director;
survey reflective responses from 12 practitioners; and informal
conversations with childcare center directors, course instructors, field
supervisors, and practitioners. The findings revealed that having the
NJITC coursework offered through an onsite PD model and supported by a
state-based scholarship program provided much needed incentives to
encourage participation. It also resulted in improved professional
growth and practice among the participating practitioners. However, it
is only to the extent that the infant/toddler practitioners continue to
engage in continuous PD beyond the ITC coursework will they be able to
keep themselves abreast of the state of knowledge and best practices
from which to further enhance their professional competence. In light of
the process and impact of the NJITC on practitioners' acquisition of
specialized knowledge, skills, and dispositions to effectively work with
infants and toddlers, implications and recommendations for policy are
discussed.

regulates waste recycling behaviour, it is important to investigate on
the external factors that may influence an individual's waste sorting
behaviour and participation rate. In this paper, we examined how four
possible external factors namely market incentives, market facilitators
such as informal recycling market, government incentive and government
facilitators influence waste separation behaviour of Hangzhou's
residents in China. The survey questionnaire was designed based on the
extension of an extant theoretical framework and literature review, and
then disseminated to the households through systematic sampling in JB
Street of Hangzhou, resulting in a sample size of 631 valid responses.
The partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was
conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of each construct. Our results
revealed a significant and positive correlation between all the
constructs to waste separation intention except the path from market
incentive to intention. We further discussed on the moderating effect of
the social-demographic variables such as social influence, gender and
income on recycling intention and waste separation behaviour. This study
expands the understanding on perceived effectiveness of external factors
that influence residents' waste separation behaviour. The findings can
be extrapolated to other countries to implement effective household
waste management policies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Increasing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing in
South Africa is vital for the HIV response. Targeting young people is
important as they become sexually active and because HIV risk rapidly
increases as youth enter their 20s. This study aims to increase the
understanding of high school learners' preferences regarding the
characteristics of HIV testing service delivery models and to inform
policy makers and implementers regarding potential barriers to and
facilitators of HIV testing.
Methods: An attitudinal survey was used to examine HIV testing
preferences among 248 high school learners in KwaZulu-Natal. Statistical
tests were used to identify the most favored characteristics of testing
service delivery models and examine key differences in preferences based
on demographic characteristics and testing history.
Results: Most learners were found to prefer testing offered at a clinic
on a Saturday (43%), using a finger prick test (59%), conducted by a
doctor (61%) who also provides individual counselling (60%). Shorter
testing times were preferred, as well as a monetary incentive to cover
any associated expenses. Time, location, the type of test, and who
conducts the test were most important. However, stratified analysis
suggests that preferences diverge, particularly around gender, grade,
but also sexual history and previous testing experience.
Conclusions: Human immunodeficiency virus testing services can be
improved in line with preferences, but there is no single optimal design
that caters to the preferences of all learners. It is unlikely that a
``one-size-fits-all{''} approach will be effective to reach HIV testing
targets. A range of options may be required to maximize coverage.

N2  - Objective: To determine factors that encourage physicians to establish
collaborative practice agreements with community pharmacists.
Methods: A 20-item cross-sectional survey was mailed to a random sample
of 1000 family medicine physicians practicing in North Carolina. Two
weeks after the initial mailing, a reminder was sent to physicians.
Physicians were entered into a drawing to receive a gift card as an
incentive for survey completion. The questionnaire collected demographic
information, factors important to physicians for collaboration with a
community pharmacist, and physician perceptions of pharmacist
qualifications. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze patterns in
the Likert scale survey responses.
Results: Of the 1000 mailed surveys, 67 were returned as undeliverable,
resulting in a final sample size of 933 surveys. One hundred forty-six
family medicine physicians responded to the survey, yielding a 15.6%
response rate. Respondents were 58% male, 73% had been practicing
longer than 10 years, and 60% had an academic affiliation. Our results
indicate that an established relationship with a community pharmacist is
the most important factor when considering a collaborative practice
agreement. At least 90% of physicians reported that the most important
pharmacist contributions were drug therapy adverse effect management,
drug interaction management, medication access assistance, prescription
counseling, and medication adherence. A majority of physicians reported
that community pharmacists improve quality outcomes and metrics (74%
and 72%, respectively).
Conclusion: Physicians in North Carolina recognize the value of the
services a pharmacist can provide to their patients. Developing
relationships between community pharmacists and physicians and
describing the value of additional credentialing in the provision of
patient care will be integral in establishing collaborative practice
agreements in the community setting. (c) 2017 American Pharmacists

N2  - Background: Achieving adequate response rates is an ongoing challenge
for longitudinal studies. The World Trade Center Health Registry is a
longitudinal health study that periodically surveys a cohort of similar
to 71,000 people exposed to the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York City.
Since Wave 1, the Registry has conducted three follow-up surveys (Waves
2-4) every 3-4 years and utilized various strategies to increase survey
participation. A promised monetary incentive was offered for the first
time to survey non-respondents in the recent Wave 4 survey, conducted
13-14 years after 9/11.
Methods: We evaluated the effectiveness of a monetary incentive in
improving the response rate five months after survey launch, and
assessed whether or not response completeness was compromised due to
incentive use. The study compared the likelihood of returning a survey
for those who received an incentive offer to those who did not, using
logistic regression models. Among those who returned surveys, we also
examined whether those receiving an incentive notification had higher
rate of response completeness than those who did not, using negative
binomial regression models and logistic regression models.
Results: We found that a $ 10 monetary incentive offer was effective in
increasing Wave 4 response rates. Specifically, the $ 10 incentive
offer was useful in encouraging initially reluctant participants to
respond to the survey. The likelihood of returning a survey increased by
30% for those who received an incentive offer (AOR = 1.3, 95% CI: 1.1,
1.4), and the incentive increased the number of returned surveys by
18%. Moreover, our results did not reveal any significant differences
on response completeness between those who received an incentive offer
and those who did not.
Conclusions: In the face of the growing challenge of maintaining a high
response rate for the World Trade Center Health Registry follow-up
surveys, this study showed the value of offering a monetary incentive as
an additional refusal conversion strategy. Our findings also suggest
that an incentive offer could be particularly useful near the end of
data collection period when an immediate boost in response rate is
needed.

T1  - Changing the Education Workforce? The Relationships Among Teacher Quality, Motivation, and Performance Pay

JF  - TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD
VL  - 119
IS  - 4
N2  - Background/Context: With a growing body of evidence to support the
assertion that teacher quality is vital to producing better student
outcomes, policymakers continue to seek solutions to attract and retain
the best educators. Performance-based pay is a reform that has become
popular in K-12 education over the last decade. This strategy
potentially produces positive impacts on student achievement in two
ways: better alignment of financial incentives with desired outcomes and
improved the composition of the teacher workforce. While evaluations
have primarily focused on the former result, there is little research on
whether the longer-term implementation of these polices can attract more
effective teachers.
Purpose: In this study we aim to provide evidence for potential
long-term impacts that performance-based pay can have on the composition
of the teacher workforce by addressing two questions: Does
performance-based pay attract fundamentally different individuals, as
measured by their risk preferences, to the teaching profession? Are
stated preferences for a particular pay format correlated to measures of
teacher quality?
Research Design: We apply methods from experimental economics and
conduct surveys with 120 teachers from two school districts who have
experienced performance pay. We compare the risk preferences of teachers
hired under the two pay formats to test the hypothesis that
performance-based pay attracts individuals with different
characteristics to the profession. We also analyze teachers' survey
responses on their preferences for performance-based pay to determine
their relationships to two measures of teacher quality: student
test-score gains and principal evaluations.
Conclusions/Recommendations: We find mixed results regarding the ability
of performance-based pay to alter the composition of the teacher
workforce. Teachers hired with performance-based pay in place are no
different from their colleagues. However, teachers claiming to seek
employment in districts with performance-based pay in place appear
significantly less risk averse. Surprisingly, additional analyses
indicate that teachers' value-added scores and performance evaluations
do not predict a positive disposition towards merit pay. Thus, while
these results indicate the possibility for performance-based pay to
attract different individuals to teaching, they do not provide evidence
that such change would necessarily improve the composition of the
workforce. Policymakers should take this potential tradeoff into
consideration when considering the expansion of performance pay
policies.

N2  - Objectives: Healthcare facilities internationally have grown outpatient
parenteral antibiotic administration services for the last few decades.
The literature contains publications from dozens of countries describing
systematized processes with specialist oversight and their levels of
service provision and outcomes. Such descriptions are absent in the
majority of Asian countries. We sought to elucidate the extent and
nature of outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy (OPAT) in Asia and to
consider the ramifications and opportunities for improvement
Methods: Utilizing colleagues and their personal networks, we surveyed
healthcare facilities across 17 countries in Asia to ascertain the
current means (if any) of providing OPAT. In that survey we also sought
to explore the capacity and interest of these facilities in developing
systematized OPAT services.
Results: Responses were received from 171 different healthcare
facilities from 17 countries. Most (97/171, 57%) stated that they
administer outpatient parenteral antibiotics, but only 5 of 162
facilities (3%) outside of Singapore described comprehensive services
with specialist oversight.
Conclusions: There is very likely a large unrecognized problem of
unchecked outpatient parenteral antibiotic administration in Asia.
Developing comprehensive and systematized OPAT in Asia is needed as a
priority in an environment in which the infectious diseases community is
demanding broad stewardship approaches. There are nonetheless challenges
in establishing and sustaining OPAT programmes. Local champions and
leverage off identified local incentives and needs are key to regional
advancement.

N2  - While impacts of climate change on agricultural systems have been widely
researched, there is still limited understanding of what agricultural
innovations have evolved over time in response to both climatic and
non-climatic drivers. Although there has been some progress in
formulating national adaptation policies and strategic planning in
different countries of South Asia, research to identify local-level
adaptive strategies and practices is still limited. Through eight case
studies and a survey of 300 households in 15 locations in India, Nepal
and Bangladesh, this paper generates empirical evidence on emerging
agricultural innovations in contrasting socio-economic, geographical and
agro-ecological contexts. The study demonstrates that several farm
practices (innovations) have emerged in response to multiple drivers
over time, with various forms of institutional and policy support,
including incentives to reduce risks in the adoption of innovative
practice. It further shows that there is still limited attempt to
systematically mainstream adaptation innovations into local, regional
and national government structures, policies and planning processes. The
paper shows that the process of farm-level adaptation through innovation
adoption forms an important avenue for agricultural adaptation in South
Asia. A key implication of this finding is that there is a need for
stronger collaborations between research institutions, extension
systems, civil society and the private sector actors to enhance emerging
adaptive innovations at the farm level.

N2  - The extent of United States Great Plains grass agriculture has ebbed and
flowed over decades in response to market incentives, government
policies, technological innovations and weather patterns. Our thesis is
that the land most responsive to these drivers is at the economic margin
between grass-based production and cropping. Much of the eastern Dakotas
is such an area, primarily under crop-based agriculture although grass
remains an important land use. We surveyed land operators in the area on
their views about motivators for land use choices. Their views are
largely consistent with the economic margin viewpoint. The importance of
crop output prices, crop input prices, innovations in cropping equipment
and weather patterns on land use decisions grow as one moves north
toward the economic margin. Land in more highly sloped areas is more
sensitive to crop prices and crop.insurance policies. Consistent with
human capital theory, older operators are generally less responsive to
factors that affect land use. Those renting more land, being more
exposed to market forces, are more responsive. As farm size increases,
respondents declared higher land use sensitivity to policy issues and
technological innovations, suggesting that scale effects render land
units more sensitive to land use change drivers. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

response rate of 24.8%. Participants were asked to respond to questions
regarding their work environment, mental well-being, overall quality of
life, and job satisfaction. Differences were identified based on whether
the participant was a paid employee or unpaid worker. Based on time
spent outdoors during the workday, the only difference within the
overall group existed with regard to how frequently the participant ate
outdoors and their reported mental well-being. On the quality of life
questions, differences for the overall sample, the paid group, and the
unpaid group were found for having window views of plants or nature. On
the job satisfaction question, differences were identified in the
overall sample and the paid group for having awindowin their immediate
office or workplace. Several variables did not identify any
statistically significant difference, which might result from this
sample being already largely connected to nature due to their employment
or volunteer work within a public garden.

N2  - Background: Dramatic increases in the migration of human resources for
health (HRH) from developing countries like the Philippines can have
consequences on the sustainability of health systems. In this paper, we
trace the outflows of HRH from the Philippines, map out its key causes
and consequences, and identify relevant policy responses.
Methods: This mixed method study employed a decentered, comparative
approach that involved three phases: (a) a scoping review on health
workers' migration of relevant policy documents and academic literature
on health workers' migration from the Philippines; and primary data
collection with (b) 37 key stakeholders and (c) household surveys with
seven doctors, 329 nurses, 66 midwives, and 18 physical therapists.
Results: Filipino health worker migration is best understood within the
context of macro-, meso-, and micro-level factors that are situated
within the political, economic, and historical/colonial legacy of the
country. Underfunding of the health system and un- or underemployment
were push factors for migration, as were concerns for security in the
Philippines, the ability to practice to full scope or to have
opportunities for career advancement. The migration of health workers
has both negative and positive consequences for the Philippine health
system and its health workers. Stakeholders focused on issues such as on
brain drain, gain, and circulation, and on opportunities for knowledge
and technology transfer. Concomitantly, migration has resulted in the
loss of investment in human capital. The gap in the supply of health
workers has affected the quality of care delivered, especially in rural
areas. The opening of overseas opportunities has commercialized health
education, compromised its quality, and stripped the country of skilled
learning facilitators. The social cost of migration has affected emigres
and their families. At the household level, migration has engendered
increased consumerism and materialism and fostered dependency on
overseas remittances. Addressing these gaps requires time and resources.
At the same time, migration is, however, seen by some as an opportunity
for professional growth and enhancement, and as a window for drafting
more effective national and inter-country policy responses to HRH
mobility.
Conclusions: Unless socioeconomic conditions are improved and health
professionals are provided with better incentives, staying in the
Philippines will not be a viable option. The massive expansion in
education and training designed specifically for outmigration creates a
domestic supply of health workers who cannot be absorbed by a system
that is underfunded. This results in a paradox of underservice,
especially in rural and remote areas, at the same time as
underemployment and outmigration. Policy responses to this paradox have
not yet been appropriately aligned to capture the multilayered and
complex nature of these intersecting phenomena.

N2  - As smartphones are being replaced at an increasing rate, it becomes more
and more important to find ways to reuse (parts of) existing phones.
This research investigates the potential of selling refurbished
smartphones using a quantitative study. An online survey was conducted
questioning 250 respondents, in which the perceived consumer risks and
benefits associated with refurbished phones were investigated.
Furthermore, we studied the impact of various incentives that companies
can employ to improve consumers' purchase intention of refurbished
phones. Through a cluster analysis six distinct customer groups were
identified. Our sample demonstrated a positive attitude towards
refurbished smartphones, with most potential for three out of our six
customer groups (46% of our sample). This indicates that refurbished
smartphones can be a market success. It was found that perceived
environmental benefits and awareness of refurbishing have a positive
impact on the consumers' purchase intention for refurbished smartphones.
Most of the highest scoring incentives for purchasing refurbished
smartphones were product-related and included improved battery life,
guaranteed software updates and upgraded performance, indicating a need
for continued performance. This research contributes to our theoretical
understanding of consumer responses to refurbished smartphones and can
help companies in launching these products successfully. (C) 2017

N2  - BACKGROUND: In the current health-care environment, respiratory care may
need to make significant changes to academic preparation and clinical
practice. The purpose of this research was to assess current needs of
respiratory therapists (RTs) in New York State and to understand how RTs
perceive their future clinical and academic roles. METHODS: This study
employed a descriptive, cross-sectional non-experimental design. Between
October and December 2014, a 32-item online survey was distributed via
e-mail to the 2,170 members of the New York State Society of Respiratory
Care. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize responses, and
bivariate analyses were assessed using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U
tests. RESULTS: The response rate was 22% and resulted in 435 valid
surveys returned. Seventy percent of 415 respondents agreed that the
practice of respiratory care is at risk of losing practitioners. The
most important incentive for retention of practitioners in the field was
professional growth and an expanded scope of clinical practice.
Specifically, the most important of these roles was gaining the ability
to assess patients, develop a plan of care, and receive reimbursement
for services. Sixty-four percent of 415 respondents strongly agreed that
the minimum academic standard for RTs should be raised to the
baccalaureate level. Of 415 respondents, the majority (78%) agreed that
it is important for therapists to remain in the profession and to be an
active member of the American Association for Respiratory Care (83%).
CONCLUSIONS: These data are useful to the profession, notably for
academic programs that must meet the need for a more highly prepared and
skilled workforce. The findings emphasize that viability of the
profession in the current health-care environment calls for the
evolution of a more autonomous RT who can be reimbursed for services and
obtain salaries that are competitive with other health professions. (C)

N2  - Background
Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) assesses individuals' current
experiences, behaviors, and moods as they occur in real time and in
their natural environment. EMA studies, particularly those of longer
duration, are complex and require an infrastructure to support the data
flow and monitoring of EMA completion.
Objective
Our objective is to provide a practical guide to developing and
implementing an EMA study, with a focus on the methods and logistics of
conducting such a study.
Methods
The EMPOWER study was a 12-month study that used EMA to examine the
triggers of lapses and relapse following intentional weight loss. We
report on several studies that informed the implementation of the
EMPOWER study: (1) a series of pilot studies, (2) the EMPOWER study's
infrastructure, (3) training of study participants in use of smartphones
and the EMA protocol and, (4) strategies used to enhance adherence to
completing EMA surveys.
Results
The study enrolled 151 adults and had 87.4% (132/151) retention rate at
12 months. Our learning experiences in the development of the
infrastructure to support EMA assessments for the 12-month study spanned
several topic areas. Included were the optimal frequency of EMA prompts
to maximize data collection without overburdening participants; the
timing and scheduling of EMA prompts; technological lessons to support a
longitudinal study, such as proper communication between the Android
smartphone, the Web server, and the database server; and use of a phone
that provided access to the system's functionality for EMA data
collection to avoid loss of data and minimize the impact of loss of
network connectivity. These were especially important in a 1-year study
with participants who might travel. It also protected the data
collection from any server-side failure. Regular monitoring of
participants' response to EMA prompts was critical, so we built in
incentives to enhance completion of EMA surveys. During the first 6
months of the 12-month study interval, adherence to completing EMA
surveys was high, with 88.3% (66,978/75,888) completion of random
assessments and around 90% (23,411/25,929 and 23,343/26,010) completion
of time-contingent assessments, despite the duration of EMA data
collection and challenges with implementation.
Conclusions
This work informed us of the necessary preliminary steps to plan and
prepare a longitudinal study using smartphone technology and the
critical elements to ensure participant engagement in the potentially
burdensome protocol, which spanned 12 months. While this was a
technology-supported and -programmed study, it required close oversight
to ensure all elements were functioning correctly, particularly once
human participants became involved.

N2  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is now accepted as the standard of care
for axillary staging in women with node-negative breast cancer.
Currently, dye, radioisotope (RI), and fluorescence indocyanine green
(fICG) are tracers available. Importance of these three tracers has been
recognized for SLN biopsy but the trend for SLN mapping has not been
reported. Aim of this national wide survey was to evaluate practice
patterns of SLN biopsy in Japan.
This survey was conducted to examine the clinical practice of SLN biopsy
in centers where one or more Japanese Breast Cancer Society (JBCS)
board-certified surgeons practice breast cancer care. Their responses
were recorded from 1 to 30 Oct 2014 and received by mail or fax in
Japan. The questionnaire included three items: the number of breast
cancer patients treated per year, the number of SLN biopsy procedures in
a single year, and the methods for SLN detection.
A total of 412 responses excluding the 63 centers that do not perform
the surgery were analyzed. Out of them, 206 (50 %) centers had a gamma
probe, 118 (29 %) had an NIR fluorescence imaging system, and both were
available at 49 (12 %) of the centers. Neither RI nor fICG was
available in 137 (33 %). The dye method was preferentially used in
private hospitals. In 412 centers, a total of 36,221 patients underwent
SLN biopsy per year and 23,038 (64 %) received radioactive tracer. fICG
was co-applied with RI in 83 and 13 % of patients, respectively. Single
mapping with RI alone was used in only 4 % of patients. The
non-radioactive method was used for routine SLN biopsy in 13,183 (36 %)
patients {[}8533 (24 %) for dye alone and 4650 (12 %) for fICG alone].
A radioactive tracer was used in 64 % of women with early breast cancer
for SLN biopsy while approximately 24 % received dye alone, which was
especially prevalent in PHs. The fICG was used in only 12 % as a
non-radioactive method but incentive package for fICG by national health
insurance plan could increase the number of NIR imaging systems and
improve the sensitivity for SLN biopsy in Japan.

N2  - Objective
This study assesses dental clinicians' pre-and post-implementation
attitudes, skills, and experiences with three clinical decision support
(CDS) tools built into the electronic health record (EHR) of a
multi-specialty group dental practice.
Methods
Electronic surveys designed to examine factors for acceptance of
EHR-based CDS tools including caries management by risk assessment,
(CAMBRA), periodontal disease management by risk assessment (PEMBRA) and
a risk assessment-based Proactive Dental Care Plan (PDCP) were
distributed to all Willamette Dental Group employees at 2 time points; 3
months pre-implementation (Fall 2013) and 15 months after implementation
(winter 2015). The surveys collected demographics, measures of job
experience and satisfaction, and attitudes toward each CDS tool. The
baseline survey response rate among clinicians was 83.1% (n 567) and
follow-up survey response rate was 63.2% (n = 508). Among the 344
clinicians who responded to both before and after surveys, 27% were
general and specialist dentists, 32% were dental hygienists, and 41%
were dental assistants.
Results
Adherence to the CDS tools has been sustained at 98%+ since roll-out.
Between baseline and follow-up, the change in mean attitude scores
regarding CAM BRA reflect statistically significant improvement in
formal training, knowing how to use the tools, belief in the science
supporting the tools, and the usefulness of the tool to motivate
patients. For PEMBRA, statistically significant improvement was found in
formal training, knowing how to use the tools, belief in the science
supporting the tools, with improvement also found in belief that the
format and process worked well. Finally, for the PDCP, significant and
positive changes were seen for every attitude and skill item scored. A
strong and positive correlation with post-implementation attitudes was
found with positive experiences in the work environment, whereas a
negative correlation was found with workload and stress. Clinicians
highly ranked a commitment to evidence-based care and sense that the
tools were helping to improve patient care, health, and experience as
motivations to use the tools. Peer pressure, fears about malpractice,
and incentive pay were rated the lowest among the motivation factors.
Conclusion
This study shows that CDS tools built into the EHR can be successfully
implemented in a dental practice and widely accepted by the entire
clinical team. Achieving a high level of adherence to use of CDS can be
done through adequate training, alignment with the mission and purpose
of the organization, and is compatible with an improved work environment
and clinician satisfaction.

N2  - Congress has expressed concern about electronic health record (EHR)
vendors and health care providers knowingly interfering with the
electronic exchange of patient health information. These information
blocking practices would privately benefit vendors and providers but
limit the societal quality and efficiency benefits from EHR adoption. We
found that information blocking is reported to frequently occur among
EHR vendors as well as hospitals and health systems, and that it is
perceived to be motivated by opportunities for revenue gain. Because
information blocking is largely legal today, the most effective policy
response likely involves a combination of direct enforcement and the
altering of market conditions that promote information blocking.
ContextCongress has raised concerns about providers and electronic
health record (EHR) vendors knowingly engaging in business practices
that interfere with electronic health information exchange (HIE). Such
information blocking is presumed to occur because providers and vendors
reap financial benefits, but these practices harm public good and
substantially limit the value to be gained from EHR adoption. Crafting a
policy response has been difficult because, beyond anecdotes, there is
no data that captures the extent of information blocking.
MethodsWe conducted a national survey of leaders of HIE efforts who work
to enable HIE across provider organizations. We asked them about the
frequency of information blocking, its specific forms, and the
effectiveness of various policy strategies to address it. We received
responses from 60 individuals (57% response rate). We calculated
descriptive statistics across responses.
FindingsHalf of respondents reported that EHR vendors routinely engage
in information blocking, and 25% of respondents reported that hospitals
and health systems routinely do so. Among EHR vendors, the most common
form of information blocking was deploying products with limited
interoperability. Among hospitals and health systems, the most common
form was coercing providers to adopt particular EHR or HIE technology.
Increasing transparency of EHR vendor business practices and product
performance, stronger financial incentives for providers to share
information, and making information blocking illegal were perceived as
the most effective policy remedies.
ConclusionsInformation blocking appears to be real and fairly
widespread. Policymakers have some existing levers that can be used to
curb information blocking and help information flow to where it is
needed to improve patient care. However, because information blocking is
largely legal today, a strong response will involve new legislation and
associated enforcement actions.

N2  - This paper proposes a novel simulator of energy consumption patterns
that allows designing demand side management (DSM) strategies without
economic incentives. The simulator emulates consumers' patterns with and
without installed DSM interfaces, based on both actual consumption
measurements and surveys applied to the inhabitants of an existing
isolated microgrid (Huatacondo, Chile) that has a particular DSM
strategy without economic incentives. The simulator uses Markov chains
to generate data characterizing consumption patterns without DSM and
Bayesian networks for cases in which the users respond to the DSM
strategy. Data obtained from the simulator are used to derive a response
model of the consumers to the DSM interface, which can be included for
the energy management system design. Results show that the implemented
strategy can be effective and can generate savings up to 4.45% in
diesel consumption for an ideal case where all the dwellings have the
interface installed. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - IMPORTANCE Despite the significant contribution of surgical spending to
health care costs, most surgeons are unaware of their operating room
costs. OBJECTIVE To examine the association between providing surgeons
with individualized cost feedback and surgical supply costs in the
operating room.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The OR Surgical Cost Reduction (OR
SCORE) project was a single-health system, multihospital,
multidepartmental prospective controlled study in an urban academic
setting. Intervention participants were attending surgeons in orthopedic
surgery, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, and neurological surgery
(n = 63). Control participants were attending surgeons in cardiothoracic
surgery, general surgery, vascular surgery, pediatric surgery,
obstetrics/ gynecology, ophthalmology, and urology (n = 186).
INTERVENTIONS From January 1 to December 31, 2015, each surgeon in the
intervention group received standardized monthly scorecards showing the
median surgical supply direct cost for each procedure type performed in
the prior month compared with the surgeon's baseline (July 1, 2012, to
November 30, 2014) and compared with all surgeons at the institution
performing the same procedure at baseline. All surgical departments were
eligible for a financial incentive if theymet a 5% cost reduction goal.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomewas each group's median
surgical supply cost per case. Secondary outcome measures included total
departmental surgical supply costs, case mix index-adjusted median
surgical supply costs, patient outcomes (30-day readmission, 30-day
mortality, and discharge status), and surgeon responses to a
postintervention study-specific health care value survey.
RESULTS The median surgical supply direct costs per case decreased
6.54% in the intervention group, from $1398 (interquartile range
{[}IQR], $ 316-$5181) (10 637 cases) in 2014 to $1307 (IQR,
$319-$5037) (11 820 cases) in 2015. In contrast, the median surgical
supply direct cost increased 7.42% in the control group, from $712
(IQR, $202-$1602) (16 441 cases) in 2014 to $765 (IQR, $233-$1719)
(17 227 cases) in 2015. This decrease represents a total savings of
$836 147 in the intervention group during the 1-year study. After
controlling for surgeon, department, patient demographics, and clinical
indicators in a mixed-effects model, there was a 9.95%(95% CI,
3.55%-15.93%; P =.003) surgical supply cost decrease in the
intervention group over 1 year. Patient outcomes were equivalent or
improved after the intervention, and surgeons who received scorecards
reported higher levels of cost awareness on the health care value survey
compared with controls.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Cost feedback to surgeons, combined with a
small departmental financial incentive, was associated with
significantly reduced surgical supply costs, without negatively
affecting patient outcomes.

N2  - Background: Digital health has the potential to support care delivery
for chronic illness. Despite positive evidence from localized
implementations, new technologies have proven slow to become accepted,
integrated, and routinized at scale.
Objective: The aim of our study was to examine barriers and facilitators
to implementation of digital health at scale through the evaluation of a
37m pound national digital health program: Delivering Assisted Living
Lifestyles at Scale{''} (dallas) from 2012-2015.
Methods: The study was a longitudinal qualitative, multi-stakeholder,
implementation study. The methods included interviews (n=125) with key
implementers, focus groups with consumers and patients (n=7), project
meetings (n=12), field work or observation in the communities (n=16),
health professional survey responses (n=48), and cross program
documentary evidence on implementation (n=215). We used a sociological
theory called normalization process theory (NPT) and a longitudinal (3
years) qualitative framework analysis approach. This work did not study
a single intervention or population. Instead, we evaluated the processes
(of designing and delivering digital health), and our outcomes were the
identified barriers and facilitators to delivering and mainstreaming
services and products within the mixed sector digital health ecosystem.
Results: We identified three main levels of issues influencing readiness
for digital health: macro (market, infrastructure, policy), meso
(organizational), and micro (professional or public). Factors hindering
implementation included: lack of information technology (IT)
infrastructure, uncertainty around information governance, lack of
incentives to prioritize interoperability, lack of precedence on
accountability within the commercial sector, and a market perceived as
difficult to navigate. Factors enabling implementation were: clinical
endorsement, champions who promoted digital health, and public and
professional willingness.
Conclusions: Although there is receptiveness to digital health, barriers
to mainstreaming remain. Our findings suggest greater investment in
national and local infrastructure, implementation of guidelines for the
safe and transparent use and assessment of digital health,
incentivization of interoperability, and investment in upskilling of
professionals and the public would help support the normalization of
digital health. These findings will enable researchers, health care
practitioners, and policy makers to understand the current landscape and
the actions required in order to prepare the market and accelerate
uptake, and use of digital health and wellness services in context and
at scale.

N2  - Background: Chile is the second world's largest per capita consumer of
caloric beverages. Caloric beverages are associated with overweight,
obesity and other chronic diseases. The objective of this study is to
estimate the price elasticity of demand for soft drinks, other
sugar-sweetened beverages and high-energy dense foods in urban areas in
Chile in order to evaluate the potential response of households'
consumption to changes in prices.
Methods: We used microdata from the VII Family Budget Survey 2012-2013,
which collects information on expenditures made by Chilean urban
households on items such as beverages and foods. We estimated a Linear
Approximation of an Almost Ideal Demand System Model to derive own and
cross price elasticities of milk, coffee, tea and other infusions, plain
water, soft drinks, other flavored beverages, sweet snacks, sugar and
honey, and desserts. We considered the censored nature of the data and
included the Inverse Mills Ratio in each equation of the demand system.
We estimated a Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System and a two-part model
as sensitivity analysis.
Results: We found an own price-elasticity of -1.37 for soft drinks. This
implies that a price increase of 10% is associated with a reduction in
consumption of 13.7%. We found that the rest of food and beverages
included in the demand system behave as substitutes for soft drinks. For
instance, plain water showed a cross-price elasticity of 0.63: a 10%
increase in price of soft drinks could lead to an increase of 6.3% of
plain water. Own and cross price elasticities were similar between
models.
Conclusions: The demand of soft drinks is price sensitive among Chilean
households. An incentive system such as subsidies to non-sweetened
beverages and tax to soft drinks could lead to increases in the
substitutions for other healthier beverages.

N2  - Purpose
To establish a baseline overall response rate for surveys of health
professions trainees, determine strategies associated with improved
response rates, and evaluate for the presence of nonresponse bias.
Method
The authors performed a comprehensive analysis of all articles published
in Academic Medicine, Medical Education, and Advances in Health Sciences
Education in 2013, recording response rates. Additionally, they reviewed
nonresponse bias analyses and factors suggested in other fields to
affect response rate including survey delivery method, prenotification,
and incentives.
Results
The search yielded 732 total articles; of these, 356 were research
articles, and of these, 185 (52.0%) used at least one survey. Of these,
66 articles (35.6%) met inclusion criteria and yielded 73 unique
surveys. Of the 73 surveys used, investigators reported a response rate
for 63.0% of them; response rates ranged from 26.6% to 100%, mean
(standard deviation) 71.3% (19.5%). Investigators reported using
incentives for only 16.4% of the 73 surveys. The only survey
methodology factor significantly associated with response rate was
single-vs. multi-institutional surveys (respectively, 74.6% {[}21.2%]
vs. 62.0% {[}12.8%], P = .022). Notably, statistical power for all
analyses was limited. No articles evaluated for nonresponse bias.
Conclusions
Approximately half of the articles evaluated used a survey as part of
their methods. Limited data are available to establish a baseline
response rate among health professions trainees and inform researchers
which strategies are associated with higher response rates. Journals
publishing survey-based health professions education research should
improve reporting of response rate, nonresponse bias, and other survey
factors.

N2  - While some research has examined general attitudes about efforts to
reduce overutilization of services, such as the Choosing Wisely(A (R))
(CW) initiative, little data exists regarding primary care providers'
attitudes regarding individual recommendations.
We sought to identify whether particular CW recommendations were
perceived by primary care providers as difficult to follow, difficult
for patients to accept, or both.
Two national surveys, one by mail to a random sample of 2000 U.S.
primary care physicians in November 2013, and the second electronically
to a random sample of 2500 VA primary care providers (PCPs) in
October-December 2014.
A total of 603 U.S. primary care physicians and 1173 VA primary care
providers. Response rates were 34 and 48 %, respectively.
PCP ratings of whether 12 CW recommendations for screening, testing and
treatments applicable to adult primary care were difficult to follow and
difficult for patients to accept; and ratings of potential barriers to
reducing overutilization.
For four recommendations regarding not screening or testing in
asymptomatic patients, less than 20 % of PCPs found the CW
recommendations difficult to accept (range 7.2-16.6 %) or difficult for
patients to follow (12.2-19.3 %). For five recommendations regarding
testing or treatment for symptomatic conditions, however, there was both
variation in reported difficulty to follow (9.8-32 %) and a high level
of reported difficulty for patients to accept (35.7-87.1 %). The most
frequently reported barriers to reducing overuse included malpractice
concern, patient requests for services, lack of time for shared decision
making, and the number of tests recommended by specialists.
While PCPs found many CW recommendations easy to follow, they felt that
some, especially those for symptomatic conditions, would be difficult
for patients to accept. Overcoming PCPs' perceptions of patient
acceptability will require approaches beyond routine physician
education, feedback and financial incentives.

N2  - Introduction: The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is
the largest federal food assistance program designed to alleviate food
insecurity and improve dietary intake. This study assessed the opinions
of SNAP participants and food-insufficient nonparticipants on their
perceptions of the program and strategies to improve its nutritional
impact.
Methods: This study surveyed 387 individuals via Amazon Mechanical Turk,
of whom 118 were SNAP participants and 269 were food insufficient but
not enrolled in SNAP (nonparticipants). Open-ended questions were coded
and analyzed for thematic content. For closed-ended questions, response
frequencies were compared using chi-square tests. Data were analyzed in
2016.
Results: SNAP participants reported that the program successfully served
its primary purpose: to allow individuals to buy enough food to make
ends meet and reduce food insecurity. Importance was placed on buying
food for their children/families and the ability to allocate money for
other expenses. To improve the nutritional impact, SNAP participants
suggested more nutrition education, increasing the benefit allotment,
incentivizing healthful foods, and excluding unhealthful foods for
purchase with SNAP. When participants and nonparticipants were asked to
choose between SNAP and a nutritionally enhanced program combining
healthy incentives with exclusions for sugary beverages (i.e., SNAP+),
68% of participants and 83% of nonparticipants chose SNAP+. Of those
who initially chose SNAP, 68% of participants and 64% of
nonparticipants chose SNAP+ if paired with a 50% increase in total
benefits.
Conclusions: SNAP participants and food-insufficient nonparticipants
support policies that facilitate purchases of healthful foods and limit
purchases of unhealthful foods, specifically sugary beverages. (C) 2016

N2  - To assess both the behaviors and social variables related to
antimicrobial therapy for clinical mastitis, we sent a survey to 1,700
dairy farms in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Florida in January and
February 2013. The survey included questions related to 7 major areas:
sociodernographic and farm characteristics, milking proficiency, milking
systems, cow environment, infected cow monitoring and treatment, farm
labor, and attitudes toward mastitis and related antimicrobial use. The
overall response rate was 41% (21% in Florida, 39% in Michigan, and
45% in Pennsylvania). Herd size ranged from 9 to 5,800 cows. Only a
small proportion of herds frequently or always cultured milk samples for
bacteriology from cows with a high somatic cell count (17%), cows with
clinical mastitis (18%), or bulk tank milk (13%). Likewise, only 56%
of herds frequently or always maintained records of all treated cows and
49% reviewed records before administering mastitis treatments.
Multivariate analysis determined that use of treatment records was
associated with increased likelihood of frequent use for both
intramammary (IMA) and systemic (SYA) administration of antimicrobial
drugs for therapy of clinical mastitis. As would be expected, use of
natural (organic) therapies was associated with decreased use of IMA, as
was the respondent being a member of an Amish community. Lower levels of
education and the use of bacterins to control Staphylococcus aureus
mastitis were also associated with decreased IMA, whereas increased use
of IMA at dry off and the belief that ``bad luck{''} plays a role in
mastitis problems were associated with increased IMA. Use of an internal
teat sealant, the respondent being the sole proprietor, being from
Michigan, use of conductivity to measure subclinical mastitis, the
respondent placing increasing importance on decreasing antibiotic
residues in cull Cows, and having financial incentives for employees
linked to somatic cell count were associated with increased use of SYA
for the treatment of clinical mastitis. Use of sand or mattresses for
bedding were associated with decreased SYA. These findings highlight the
need to improve the acceptance of practices that are consistent with
prudent antimicrobial use for the treatment of clinical mastitis on
dairy farms. Additionally, the willingness of dairy farmers to
administer antimicrobial drugs for the treatment of clinical mastitis is
associated with other mastitis-related practices and attitudes.

N2  - Fishing is an important recreational activity for many Australians, with
one in every four people participating every year. There are however
many different pressures exerted on Australian fish stocks, including
climate related changes that drive changes in local fish abundances. It
is inevitable that recreational fishers will need to adapt to these
changes. When resource abundance alters substantially, user adaptation
to the new situation is required and policies and incentives may need to
be developed to encourage behaviour change. It is important to correctly
anticipate fisher's response to these policies and incentives as much as
possible. Improved understanding of recreational fisher's likely
adaptation decisions and the nature and timing of these decisions can
help avoid unintended consequences of management decisions. Based on a
survey of recreational fishers in the south-east Australian climate
hotspot, we identify 4 relevant dimensions to recreational fisher's
behavioural adaptation. There are differences in adaptation timing
(early, late, and non-adaptors). Non-adaptors are characterised by
greater cultural attachment to fishing and stronger perceptions of the
factors that influence abundance change. The fisher's preferred
adaptation responses and the timing of the behavioural response differs
between decreasing versus increasing fish abundance. Insight into
perspectives and expectations on how recreational fishers might adapt to
changes is useful to develop a set of behavioural incentives that appeal
to different groups but remain efficient and effective in their
implementation. Such knowledge can create new pathways to achieve
meaningful and targeted adaptation responses for different types of
recreational fishers.

N2  - Use of zinc (Zn) fertilisers may be cost-effective in increasing crop
yields and in alleviating dietary Zn deficiency. However, Zn fertilisers
are underutilised in many countries despite the widespread occurrence of
Zn-deficient soils. Here, increased Zn fertiliser-use scenarios were
simulated for wheat production in Punjab and Sindh Provinces, Pakistan.
Inputs and outputs were valued in terms of both potential yield gains as
well as health gains in the population.
The current dietary Zn deficiency risk of 23.9 % in Pakistan was based
on food supply and wheat grain surveys. ``Disability-adjusted life years
(DALYs) lost{''} are a common metric of disease burden; an estimated
245,000 DALYs y(-1) are lost in Punjab and Sindh due to Zn deficiency.
Baseline Zn fertiliser-use of 7.3 kt y(-1) ZnSO4.H2O was obtained from
published and industry sources. The wheat area currently receiving Zn
fertilisers, and grain yield responses of 8 and 14 % in Punjab and
Sindh, respectively, were based on a recent survey of > 2500 farmers.
Increased grain Zn concentrations under Zn fertilisation were estimated
from literature data and converted to improved Zn intake in humans and
ultimately a reduction in DALYs lost.
Application of Zn fertilisers to the area currently under wheat
production in Punjab and Sindh, at current soil: foliar usage ratios,
could increase dietary Zn supply from similar to 12.6 to 14.6 mg capita
(-1) d(-1), and almost halve the prevalence of Zn deficiency, assuming
no other changes to food consumption. Gross wheat yield could increase
by 2.0 and 0.6 Mt. grain y(-1) in Punjab and Sindh, respectively,
representing an additional return of US$ > 800 M and an annual
increased grain supply of 19 kg capita (-1).
There are potential market- and subsidy-based incentives to increase Zn
fertiliser-use in Pakistan. Benefit-Cost Ratios (BCRs) for yield alone
are 13.3 and 17.5 for Punjab and Sindh, respectively. If each DALY is
monetised at one to three fold Gross National Income per capita on
purchasing power parity (GNI(PPP)), full adoption of Zn fertiliser for
wheat provides an additional annual return of 405-1216 M International
Dollars (I$) in Punjab alone, at a cost per DALY saved of I$ 461-619.

N2  - Many payment for ecosystem services (PES) programs, such as the Slope
Land Conversion Program (SLCP), are passive and require full
participation by impacted households. In contrast, this study considers
the alternative of ``active and incomplete{''} participation in PES
programs, in which participants are not obliged to contract their own
land, and have the right to select into the program or not. This type of
program has been popular over the last decade in China; however, there
have been few studies on the characteristics of willingness to
participate and implementation. As such, this paper uses the Choice
Experiment (CE) method to explore ways for inducing effective program
participation, by analyzing the effects of different regime attributes.
The case study used to analyze participation utility was the Jing-Ji
Afforestation Program for Ecological and Water Protection (JAPEWP), a
typical active-participation forestry PES program, and a key source of
water near Beijing in the Miyun Reservoir Catchment (MRC). Analyzing
rural household survey data indicated that the program faces a variety
of challenges, including long-term maintenance, implementation
performance, costeffectiveness, and monitoring approaches. There are
also challenges with one-size-fits-all payment strategies, due to
ineffective program participation or imperfect implementation regimes.
In response, this study proposes several policies, including providing
secure and complete land tenure to the participants, creating more local
off-farm employment opportunities, designing performance-based
monitoring systems that are integrated with financial incentives,
applying differentiated payment strategies, providing capacity building
to support forestation activities, and establishing a comprehensive
implementation regime that would address these challenges. These policy
conclusions provide valuable lessons for other active-participation PES
programs as well.

meaningful use incentives; however these implementations have been
associated with provider dissatisfaction and burnout. There are no
previously reported instances of a comprehensive EHR educational program
designed to engage providers and assist in improving efficiency and

framework, Stanford Children's Health designed a tailored provider
efficiency program with various inputs from: (1) provider specific EHR
data; (2) provider survey data; and (3) structured observation sessions.
This case report outlines the design of this individualized training

N2  - Purpose - Based upon social cognition and social exchange theories, the
purpose of this paper is to develop and test a conceptual model,
suggesting that customer psychological capitals (CPCs) affect their
knowledge sharing behavior (KSB) within a virtual innovation community
(VIC) under the influence of material reward (MR) and reciprocal
relationship (RR).
Design/methodology/approach - The sample comprises of valid responses
collected from 516 customers in five virtual innovation communities via
an online survey. The authors adopted the hierarchical regression method
to mitigate any concerns relating to endogeneity within the models, and
also to test the relationships among the variables.
Findings - CPC, MR and RR are found to have a profound impact on their
enthusiasm to share knowledge. Environmental factors play an important
role in shaping the effects of CPC on KSB. MR tends to weaken the
positive effect of CPC on KSB, whilst RR tends to strengthen the
positive effect.
Practical implications - To effectively manage a VIC, firms should make
full use of the positive impact of CPC on KSB, set up appropriate
incentive mechanisms and create a virtuous community atmosphere to
encourage knowledge sharing.
Originality/value - This study integrates two theoretical perspectives
to examine which types of psychological and environmental factors, and
which combinations of these factors, affect innovative customers to
share knowledge. It offers useful guidelines for firms to engage in
effective customer-driven products, services and/or processes

N2  - Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine the usage of
non-financial information related to corporate social responsibility
(CSR) issues from the perspective of sell-side analysts (SSAs) and
buy-side analysts (BSAs) employed in Poland-based financial
institutions.
Design/methodology/approach - The authors conducted a survey among
financial analysts with the use of the computer-assisted telephone
interview ( CATI) method and an online questionnaire. The adopted
methods included purposeful, quota sampling and snowball sampling.
Findings - Results indicate that financial analysts make use of CSR
disclosures very rarely and attribute little importance to such
information. Despite the limited use of CSR information and negative
assessments of its quality, respondents are in favor of making a more
frequent use of CSR disclosures. Finally, except for an analyst's
attitude toward the ``comparability in time{''} information
characteristic, results do not indicate any significant differences
between SSAs' and BSAs' responses.
Research limitations/implications - The limited number of questionnaires
prevented the use of more sophisticated statistical methods and the
formulation of conclusions that could apply to the entire population. In
addition, although the adopted CATI method provides a number of
advantages, it also has its limitations interviews had limited time and
the questions along with the answers had to take into account the
respondents' limited perception ability.
Practical implications - The results of this study suggest that CSR
disclosures have limited usage for financial analysts, at least in the
Polish context. Further, not only do respondents rarely make use of CSR
disclosures but they also give low assessments to their quality. This
implies that the concept of CSR remains relatively far from becoming a
priority; hence, some measures and incentives may be necessary.
Originality/value - The paper adds to a relatively small number of
studies that have dealt with the issue of non-financial information and
its usefulness for SSAs and BSAs in Central and Eastern Europe.

N2  - Background There is continuing interest in how physicians are responding
to the meaningful use of the electronic health record (EHR) incentive
program. However, little research has been done on physician beliefs
about the meaningful use of the EHR.
Objective This study aims to conduct a follow-up study of physician
beliefs about the meaningful use of the EHR.
Methods Online survey of physicians at two academic medical centers
(AMCs) in the northeast who were participating in the meaningful use of
the EHR incentive program and were using an internally developed EHR was
conducted.
Results Of the 2,033 physicians surveyed, 1,075 completed the survey for
an overall response rate of 52.9%. Only one-fifth (20.5%) of the
physicians agreed or strongly agreed that meaningful use of the EHR
would help them improve quality of care, and only a quarter (25.2%)
agreed or strongly agreed that the meaningful use of the EHR would
improve the care that their organization delivers. Physician
satisfaction with the outpatient EHR was the strongest predictor of
self-efficacy with achieving stage 2 of the meaningful use of the EHR
incentive program (odds ratio: 2.10, 95% confidence interval: 1.61,
2.75, p < 0.001). Physicians reported more negative beliefs in stage 2
than stage 1 across all belief items. For example, 28.1% agreed or
strongly agreed that the meaningful use of the EHR would decrease
medical errors in stage 2 as compared with 35.9% in stage 1 (p <
0.001).
Conclusion Only one-fifth of the physicians in our study believed that
the meaningful use of the EHR would improve quality of care,
patient-centeredness of care, or the care they personally provide.
Primary care physicians expressedmore negative beliefs about the
meaningful use of the EHR in stage 2 than in stage 1. These findings
show that physicians continue to express negative beliefs about the
meaningful use of the EHR. These ongoing negative beliefs are concerning
for both implementation and policy.

N2  - Effective climate change mitigation and adaptation in agriculture
requires farmers to gain sufficient information to plan and implement
practical climate-related actions. Science-based knowledge that meets
actors' needs supports proactive action taking. The aim of this study
was to characterize the views of farmers and other rural stakeholders
regarding farmers' climate change information needs, and to identify
potential barriers to and necessary incentives for applying climate
change mitigation and adaptation in practice. Data were collected by
conducting an internet survey in Finland for which 340 responses from
farmers, farm advisers and other rural stakeholders were received.
Applying cluster analysis, 5 information need profiles were identified:
`information highlighters', `globally and nationally oriented',
`livestock oriented', `plant production oriented' and `no interest'.
Half of the respondents believed that climate change would affect their
activities in the near future. Among respondent groups, farmers
themselves perceived the information on climate change as most
uninteresting. The complexity of the current climate change
communication and potential economic costs associated with proactivity
were found to hinder both mitigation and proactive adaptation actions.
Based on our study, climate change communication needs to be
practice-oriented and tailored to fit the needs of farmers representing
different lines of agricultural production and regional locations. Such
information, plus an integration of an assessment of the effects of
proactive action taking on farm profitability, is needed to encourage
climate change mitigation and adaptation actions on Finnish farms.

N2  - For exhibitions to have sustainable success, they must attract enough
high-quality exhibitors. As China has opened up and grown economically
in the past several decades, more Chinese exhibitors are participating
in exhibitions worldwide, and United States exhibitions are among their
top destination. To examine what motivates the participation of this
growing group, this study conducted a self-administered survey among
Chinese outbound exhibitors who have attended exhibitions in the United
States. With the help from the Chinese exhibition organizers, a
questionnaire survey was distributed to Chinese exhibitors having
participating in U.S.-based trade fairs in the past 12 months via email
for collecting data. An exploratory factor analysis and a series of
ANOVA tests were carried out to examine the Chinese exhibitors'
characteristics. The results of the 314 usable responses showed that
exhibitors with their characteristics differed significantly in the five
motivational dimensions. These dimensions relate to motivations in
social contacts and networking, sales, incentive, guanxi, and
competition. The findings have marketing implications for exhibition
organizers in both the United States and China for recruiting and
retaining Chinese exhibitors.

N2  - Understanding the cross-scale nature of how natural resource trading
links to local extraction patterns remains a topic of great relevance to
stewardship and sustainable use of ecological systems. Microeconomic
influences on a society's pattern of small-scale natural resources
utilization can exacerbate resource overuse, especially under increased
population pressure. In many rural communities that are based on a
limited diversity of resource industries, quantifying the response of
extractors and traders to market and environmental fluctuations is
critical to understanding management constraints. We examine the fishing
practices of a small lake in Uganda, East Africa, from the dual
perspectives of the traders and the fishers using a Bayesian Belief
Network approach based on detailed interview surveys. Fishers in this
small lake target Nile perch (Lates niloticus) and Nile tilapia
(Oreochromis niloticus), two fish species of high commercial and food
security significance in East Africa. We combined data on financial,
social, and ecological systems to understand how aspects of trading
quantitatively relate to fish extraction patterns in Lake Nabugabo
Uganda. Importantly, we find that the patron-client type relationships
generate incentives to extract specific fish, whereas ``freelancer{''}
independent fishers are able to create responsive and flexible
extraction practices that match market and environmental fluctuations.
Management of fishing administered by local Beach Management Units will
likely have a higher probability of success when in synchrony with
trading relationships and ecological dynamics. We use this study in
Uganda to reflect on methodological challenges and opportunities of
combining multiple types of data sets for cross-scale analysis of
social-ecological system dynamics.

to participate in interviews. This article argues that the strategies
associated with linking public goods to private goods to establish
reputation effects for the private goods involved can also be used to
enhance confidence in the objectives of the request for an interview. In
this literature, an assured reputation is established for those selling
products by offering to contribute some of the proceeds of a sale to
charity. The results of our field experiment indicate that combining
charity with financial incentives appears to increase confidence in
survey objectives for those familiar with the interview process.

Participants were recruited via passive and targeted methods. Data were
collected from 77 (pre-safeguard) and 197 (post-safeguard) participants.
Safeguards included: (1) changing the incentive from prepaid card to
raffle; (2) allowing only one IP address per response; (3) masking
eligibility; (4) adding multiple questions to ensure consistency in
responses; and (5) emphasizing data surveillance. We computed
descriptive statistics using SAS 9.4 to compare enrollment rates and
validity of data between the pre-and post-safeguard participants.
Results: Although 77 entries were collected within 24 hours
(pre-safeguards), 5 responses were ineligible and excluded. Among the
remaining 72 entries, 68.1% were fraudulent as either multiple data
entries (24.5%) and/or conflict in responses to similar survey items
(83.7%). Once safeguards were administered (post-safeguards), data
collection took longer to obtain 297 participants, which included 27
ineligibles. Among the 270 eligible participants, 35.9% were fraudulent
due to conflicting responses to similar survey items. Conclusion: Online
data collection via surveys should use safeguards to capture valid data.
Many safeguards exist, which researchers should consider when designing

N2  - Under what conditions are foreign aid donors willing to suspend foreign
aid to punish political transgressions, such as election fraud,
corruption scandals or political repression? Prior scholarship has
emphasized that political sanctions, including foreign aid suspensions,
are constrained by the geostrategic considerations of donor countries.
However, foreign aid suspensions often occur in strategically important
countries, and donors respond differently to different types of
political transgressions within the same county. To shed light on this
puzzle, in this article, I present evidence from an original survey of
top-level donor representatives in 20 African countries, including a
list experiment designed to elicit truthful responses about the
conditions under which donors are willing to suspend foreign aid. I
argue that the likelihood of a foreign aid suspension depends not only
on the strategic considerations of the donor government, but also on the
institutional incentives of the donor agency. A donor agency's
institutional incentives are shaped by the agency's organizational
design, as well as by its foreign aid portfolio in the recipient
country.

N2  - A key message of the 2014 US 3rd National Climate Assessment report is
that climate change poses threats to agriculture and will require
adaptation and mitigation by farmers. In the upper Midwest, the increase
in total precipitation and a 37% increase in very heavy precipitation
over the past 40 years are expected to continue and affect the
productivity of corn-based cropping systems. The current situation and
weather projections suggest that in the future, significant degradation
of soil and water resources can be expected. While a number of adaptive
management strategies have potential to address soil erosion, poor water
quality, and production losses, farmer responses to a changing climate
are not well understood. The research presented here examines how
farmers' self-identity as ``a good farmer{''} can translate into
specific incremental and transformative adaptations of farming
strategies. Analysis of a 2012 survey of 4778 upper Midwest farmers
finds that three nodes in the identity control model, the biophysical
situation, reflected appraisals comprised of a set of beliefs which are
sources of information input, and a farmer's identities, influence
variations in selected adaptive management practices. The biophysical
situation (flooding, drought, saturated soils, and/or having a river run
through the farm) are significant explanatory variables in seven of the
eight models and farmer's identities, conservationist and/or
productivist,are significant in all models. This is evidence that
farmers are paying attention to the biophysical situation as well as
being guided by their own understandings of themselves as good farmers
in making decisions about their farm operation. More research is needed
to better understand what activates identities, core values and beliefs
and how some values are privileged over others in adaptive decisions.
This work suggests that educators and policymakers should focus on
interventions, incentives and policies that activate the farmer's
conservationist identity to increase adaptations that protect the
agroecosystem in the longer term. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an

N2  - This article seeks to address an old and recurring theme in development
economics-the slow adoption of new technologies by farmers in many
developing countries. We explore a somewhat novel explanation for this
puzzle-the link between market access and the incentives to adopt a new
technology when there are non-convexities. We develop a theoretical
model to guide the empirical analysis that uses spatially disaggregated
agricultural production data from the International Food Policy Research
Institute and Living Standards Measurement Study survey data for
Nigeria. We estimate the impact of transport costs on crop production,
adoption of modern technologies, and the differential impact on returns
of modern versus traditional farmers. To overcome the limitation of data
availability on travel costs for much of Africa, we combine road survey
data and GIS roads networks to generate the most thorough and accurate
road network available, to our knowledge. Using these data and the
Highway Development Management Model (HDM-4), we compute minimum travel
costs from each location to the market. Consistent with our theory we
find that transportation costs are critical in determining technology
choices, with a greater responsiveness among farmers who adopt modern
technologies, and at times a perverse (negative) response to lower
transport costs among those who employ more traditional techniques. In
sum, we present compelling evidence that the constraints to the adoption
of modern technologies and access to markets are interconnected, and so
should be targeted jointly.

N2  - Purpose - This paper aims to describe the effects of 3R (reduce, reuse
and recycle) waste management initiatives on a campus community. It
ascertains the environmental attitudes and opinions of the residents and
investigates their behavioral responses to waste management initiatives.
Practical implications for enhancing sustainable waste management are
discussed in this paper.
Design/methodology/approach - Demonstration projects on waste
segregation and recycling, as well as waste a reduction campaign, were
set up on the campus to ascertain people's attitudes and investigate
their behavioral responses toward 3R practices. Data were collected
through a questionnaire survey, observations, interviews and the
project's document review. A waste audit and waste composition analysis
was carried out to assess waste flows and actual waste management
behaviors and measure the change in the recycling rate.
Findings - 3R waste management initiatives had positive effects on
people's attitudes about resources, waste management and consciousness
of the need to avoid waste, but these initiatives did not affect
recycling and waste management behavior. A voluntary approach-only
cannot bring about behavioral change. Incentive measures showed a
greater positive effect on waste reduction to landfills. Nevertheless,
the demonstration projects helped to increase the overall campus
recycling from 10 to 12 per cent.
Originality/value - This paper addresses a literature gap about the 3R
attitudes and resulting behavior as part of campus sustainability of
higher education institutions in a developing country. The authors'
results revealed hurdles to be overcome and presents results that can be
compared to behavioral responses of people from other developed
countries. These findings can be used as a guide for higher education
institution's policy-makers, as they indicate that voluntary instruments
alone will not yield effective results, and other mechanisms that have
an impact on people's behavior are required.

N2  - Purpose: Despite the benefits of early planning for business succession,
and plan implementation, many owners/managers fail to act expeditiously.
Factors such as a reluctance to accept ageing, a concern over the risks
involved and inappropriate objectives may be causative. This research
moves towards explaining this reluctance and, consequently, suggesting
ways to reduce the problem. Design/approach/methodology: Using the
literature outlining the variables associated with succession, a
hypothesis using the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) is developed to
explain the differences between planned and actual asset transfer (using
a structural equation model of the TPB). Data to explore the problem and
test the model were obtained from a postal survey of 2300 New Zealand
farms (36% response). Findings: The results show manager attitudes
related to their personality and objectives are the main causes of
reluctance. The financial benefits from successful succession also need
determining to provide incentives. Practical applications: Support
systems are required to modify farmer attitudes and consequently reduce
the reluctance. Originality/value: This work presents one of the first
attempts to quantify and systems model (using the TPB) the succession
process in a rural setting, and provides clear conclusions on reducing
succession reluctance. Theoretical implications: Farming is controlled
by humans reinforcing that farm studies must include the personal
aspects of the decision-makers.

formats in a split sample design: the dichotomous choice (DC)

is assessed by variation in the hypothetical scenarios. We demonstrate
that the DM referendum and the TWPL, two question formats that induce

N2  - Cost sharing has been widely used to encourage the management of
privately owned forests. While there is evidence of its capacity to
promote management activities, it still remains open whether cost
sharing induces additional private investments or whether it substitutes
public funds for private capital. This study re-examines the latter
issue in the case of Finnish family forest owners' pre-commercial and
restoration thinnings using data from a nation-wide survey (n = 3801). A
two-step model of cost-share participation and stand improvements is
used to account for the endogeneity of cost-share participation.
Cost-share participation was related to personal assistance and clearly
encouraged forest owners' engagement in and extent of stand
improvements. The inducement or crowding out of private capital is
analytically shown to depend on the relative magnitude of forest owners'
response to cost-share incentives in each specific situation. In the
present case evidence suggests that cost sharing has had an inducement
effect on private investment. This is likely related to the advanced
personal assistance that has promoted the knowledge of and participation
in cost sharing. The findings suggest that cost sharing can be a useful
component in a balanced policy mix especially when combined with
informational instruments. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - A new team learning assessment process was designed and tested in a
first-year university physics laboratory class. The assessment process
was designed to provide a strong incentive for students to cooperate and
feel responsible for each other's learning and fostering a sense of
collaboration rather than competition. Specifically, the new assessment
process involves randomly dividing students into teams of four to work
on a physics experiment and, at the end of the laboratory session,
randomly selecting only one team member to carry out a post-laboratory
session performance task. The results indicate that learning outcomes
were not compromised in the new assessment process and that peer
instruction was employed to a greater extent compared to our standard
process. Student responses from a post-assessment survey revealed that
76% of students considered our new assessment process to be fair,
whereas 57% of students felt our standard process was fair. The new
assessment process used in this study led to a 75% reduction in grading
duties - an advantage for large class management.

N2  - Objective. Performance thresholds are commonly used in
pay-for-performance (P4P) incentives, where providers receive a bonus
payment for achieving a prespecified target threshold but may produce
discontinuous incentives, with providers just below the threshold having
the strongest incentive to improve and providers either far below or
above the threshold having little incentive. We investigate the effect
of performance thresholds on provider response in the setting of nursing
home P4P.
Data Sources. The Minimum Data Set (MDS) and Online Survey,
Certification, and Reporting (OSCAR) datasets.
Study Setting and Design. Difference-in-differences design to test for
changes in nursing home performance in three states that implemented
threshold-based P4P (Colorado, Georgia, and Oklahoma) versus three
comparator states (Arizona, Tennessee, and Arkansas) between 2006 and
2009.
Principal Findings. We find that those farthest below the threshold
(i.e., the worst-performing nursing homes) had the largest improvements
under threshold-based P4P while those farthest above the threshold
worsened. This effect did not vary with the percentage of Medicaid
residents in a nursing home.
Conclusions. Threshold-based P4P may provide perverse incentives for
nursing homes above the performance threshold, but we do not find
evidence to support concerns about the effects of performance thresholds
on low-performing nursing homes.

N2  - Successful deployment of smart grids necessitates experimental
validation of their state-of-the-art designs in two-way communications,
real-time demand response, and monitoring of consumers' energy usage
behavior. The objective is to observe consumers' energy usage pattern
and exploit this information to assist the grid in designing incentives,
energy management mechanisms, and real-time demand response protocols,
so as help the grid achieve lower costs and improve energy supply
stability. Further, by feeding the observed information back to the
consumers instantaneously, it is also possible to promote energy
efficient behavior among users. To this end, this paper performs a
literature survey on smart grid testbeds around the world, and presents
the main accomplishments toward realizing a smart grid testbed at the
Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). The testbed is
able to monitor, analyze, and evaluate smart grid communication network
design and control mechanisms, and test the suitability of various
communications networks for both residential and commercial buildings.
The testbeds are deployed within the SUTD student dormitories and the
main university campus to monitor and record end-user energy consumption
in real-time, which will enable us to design incentives, control
algorithms, and real-time demand response schemes. The testbed also
provides an effective channel to evaluate the needs of communication
networks to support various smart grid applications. In addition, our
initial results demonstrate that our testbed can provide an effective
platform to identify energy waste, and prompt the needs of a secure
communications channel as the energy usage pattern can provide privacy
related information on individual users.

N2  - We surveyed 1,638 sales executives across 40 countries regarding their
companies' likelihood of asking sales to perform real earnings
management (REM) actions when earnings pressure exists. Using this
information, which we refer to as companies' REM propensities, we study
how company characteristics and environmental conditions relate to the
responses received. The use of cash-flow incentives for sales personnel
and the distribution of interfunctional power in favor of finance rather
than sales are both associated with companies' REM propensities. In
addition, we show that sales executives preemptively change their
behaviors in anticipation of top management's REM requests. Sales
executives working for public companies and companies in the United
States reported higher levels of REM propensity. The data also support
an association between REM propensity and finance-sales conflict. These
findings and others are compared and contrasted with existing empirical
and survey-based research on REM throughout the paper.

N2  - Modern society is driven by data. Data storage is practically unlimited
with today's technology, and analytical tools make it easy to find
patterns and make predictions in a way that is very useful for private
businesses and governments. These uses of digital data can raise
considerable privacy issues that are of great concern to consumers. In
this Article, we present and analyze the results of an extensive survey
that we conducted to explore what people know, what people do, and what
people want when it comes to privacy online.
Our survey is the first comprehensive examination of the intersection of
knowledge and opinions on topics including online privacy, law, and the
data practices of both the private sector and the government. Our survey
results indicate that consumers often want more options than the market
gives them. Over 80% of our survey participants, for example, indicated
that on some occasion they have submitted information online when they
wished that they did not have to do so. One of the possible reasons why
consumers still participate in these markets is that they do not have
any meaningful alternatives. The private sector currently has very
little incentive to provide these alternatives because consumers have
been responding to unattractive business practices with complacency.
Responses to our survey also indicate a low level of trust of the
government as a data collector and data keeper.
Our results indicate that significant changes are needed to increase
consumer engagement in the online marketplace and improve trust between
the government and its citizens. These improvements should begin by
empowering users and giving them more control over their digital data,
and we present ambitious proposals to this end. The long-term solution
that we propose would involve an overhaul of current data privacy laws
and the creation of a centralized profile repository that would serve a
purpose similar to credit reporting bureaus. Through this repository,
consumers could view and challenge most information that private
businesses and the government hold about them. Dramatic changes are
necessary in order to ensure that consumers can have empowering and
engaging experiences in today's world of digital data.

N2  - Heatwaves are the most dangerous natural hazard to health in Australia.
The frequency and intensity of heatwaves will increase due to climate
change and urban heat island effects in cities, aggravating the negative
impacts of heatwaves. Two approaches exist to develop population heat
stress resilience. Firstly, the most vulnerable social groups can be
identified and public health services can prepare for the increased
morbidity. Secondly, the population level of adaptation and the heat
stress resistance of the built environment can be increased. The
evaluation of these measures and their efficiencies has been fragmented
across research disciplines. This study explored the relationships
between the elements of heat stress resilience and their potential
demographic and housing drivers and barriers.
The responses of a representative online survey (N = 393) about heat
stress resilience at home and work from Adelaide, South Australia were
analysed. The empirical findings demonstrate that heat stress resistant
buildings increased adaptation capacity and decreased the number of
health problems. Air-conditioning increased dependence upon it, limited
passive adaptation and only people living in homes with whole-house
air-conditioning had less health problems during heatwaves. Tenants and
respondents with pre-existing health conditions were the most
vulnerable, particularly as those with health conditions were not aware
of their vulnerability. The introduction of an Energy Performance
Certificate is proposed and discussed as an effective incentive to
increase the heat stress resistance of and the general knowledge about
the built environment (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Intensive agriculture with high inputs has resulted in rapid development
of crop production in China, accompanied by negative environmental
effects such as serious non-point source agricultural pollution.
Implementation of environmentally-friendly agricultural practices can
effectively prevent such pollution. However, the acceptance and adoption
of such practices are related not only to associated risks and potential
benefits, but also to farmers' attitudes to and knowledge of
scientifically validated practices. In the presented study we surveyed
views of a stratified sample of 150 smallholder farmers and 10 extension
service experts from Xinxiang, a high grain-producing county in Henan
Province, China. Their opinions were explored in personal interviews
using a questionnaire with three sections. The first section mainly
sought informationpn surveyed farmers' demographic characteristics like
gender, age and education. The second section concemed their awareness
of the environmental problems and losses of yields associated with
customary over-fertilization practices, and their main concerns about
new practices. The third section addressed farmers' attitudes to, and
the extension service experts' professional evaluations of, five
selected practices in terms of the importance of seven factors (time
demands, costs, risks, compatibility, complexity, trialability and
observability). Acceptance indices were calculated from the responses to
rank farmers' willingness to accept the five environmentally-friendly
agricultural practices, and thus identify the most appropriate to
promote in the study area. The results show that costs, followed by
risks and observability, are the more important factors affecting
farmers' decisions to adopt a practice. The results also indicate that
no or minimum tillage and returning straw to the field are the most
appropriate practices to promote initially at large scale in Xinxiang.
The others could be popularized gradually after providing effective
incentives and training. The finding that cost is the main factor
influencing Chinese farmer contrasts with reports that EU farmers rank
risk and observability as most important, possibly due to differences in
income. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Whilst tariff-based approaches to load-shifting are common in the
residential sector, incentive-based approaches are rare. This is so,
even though providing customers incentives to shape their power
consumption patterns has substantial potential. This paper presents
findings from an exploratory UK pilot study that trials financial
payments and detailed energy feedback to incentivise load-shifting of
residential electricity consumption.
An intervention study was implemented measuring actual energy use by
individual households as well as conducting surveys and interviews.
From the trials it was found that the approaches resulted in reductions
in peak time energy use. Evidence from the study found that the
incentives-based approaches were able to overcome some of the barriers
to response experienced in Time-of-Use studies, though less good on
others. Interestingly, the height of the barriers varied by the
electricity-using practice and the incentivising approach applied. The
height of the barriers also varied by participant.
The study concludes by identifying that broad participation in demand
response is likely to require a suite of incentivising approaches that
appeal to different people, a key policy finding of interest to
international agencies, government, public and private sector entities.

N2  - Public policy programs must often impose limits on who may be eligible
for benefits. Despite research on the impact of exclusion in developed
countries, there is little evidence on how people react to being
excluded from benefits in developing societies. Utilizing repeated waves
of data from an experimental evaluation of Mexico's foundational
PROGRESA antipoverty program, we examine the impact of exclusion and
distinguish two separate forms. ``Statistical exclusion{''} occurs where
determination of benefits is based on randomized assignment to a
treatment and control group. ``Needs-based exclusion{''} occurs when
benefits programs are designed to be selective rather than universal,
basing eligibility on characteristics, like relative poverty, that are
difficult to measure simply and accurately. Focusing on temporal
variation in survey non-response as our behavioral outcome, we show that
needs-based exclusion has much greater negative effects on continued
participation than statistical exclusion. We also show that these
effects are concentrated among the wealthy, that is, those furthest from
the eligibility cut-off line.. These findings reinforce general concerns
about the validity of evaluation studies when incentives are at work. We
discuss both the behavioral explanations that might underlie these
findings as well as some potential approaches to reduce threats to
evaluation validity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Shortages of health workers in low-income countries are
exacerbated by the international migration of health workers to more
affluent countries. This problem is compounded by the active recruitment
of health workers by destination countries, particularly Australia,
Canada, UK and USA. The World Health Organization (WHO) adopted a
voluntary Code of Practice in May 2010 to mitigate tensions between
health workers' right to migrate and the shortage of health workers in
source countries. The first empirical impact evaluation of this Code was
conducted 11-months after its adoption and demonstrated a lack of impact
on health workforce recruitment policy and practice in the short-term.
This second empirical impact evaluation was conducted 4-years
post-adoption using the same methodology to determine whether there have
been any changes in the perceived utility, applicability, and
implementation of the Code in the medium-term.
Methods: Forty-four respondents representing government, civil society
and the private sector from Australia, Canada, UK and USA completed an
email-based survey evaluating their awareness of the Code, perceived
impact, changes to policy or recruitment practices resulting from the
Code, and the effectiveness of non-binding Codes generally. The same
survey instrument from the original study was used to facilitate direct
comparability of responses. Key lessons were identified through thematic
analysis.
Results: The main findings between the initial impact evaluation and the
current one are unchanged. Both sets of key informants reported no
significant policy or regulatory changes to health worker recruitment in
their countries as a direct result of the Code due to its lack of
incentives, institutional mechanisms and interest mobilizers.
Participants emphasized the existence of previous bilateral and regional
Codes, the WHO Code's non-binding nature, and the primacy of competing
domestic healthcare priorities in explaining this perceived lack of
impact.
Conclusions: The Code has probably still not produced the tangible
improvements in health worker flows it aspired to achieve. Several
actions, including a focus on developing bilateral codes, linking the
Code to topical global priorities, and reframing the Code's purpose to
emphasize health system sustainability, are proposed to improve the
Code's uptake and impact.

N2  - This study presents the results from a survey of landowner interest in a
propositional payment modality for Costa Rica's Pagos por Servicios
Ambientales (PSA) program that is based on a sliding-scale payment
scheme. This payment scheme would transition from higher monetary
payments per hectare per year for the first units of land invested, to
lower payments per hectare per Year for additional units of land
invested; however, as payments per hectare decrease, monetary payments
would be supplemented with non-financial rewards. This program structure
is designed to 1) offer higher per-hectare financial incentives to
smaller scale landowners, who would otherwise face steep trade-off costs
by transitioning to conservation-based land-use, and 2) offer greater
non-financial incentives to larger-scale landowners, who face less sharp
trade-off costs, and who might be more interested in prestige- and
status-based non-financial incentives than the currently meager PSA
payments. I found support for the proposed program modality across all
classes of landowners. Interest in PSA participation by small- and
medium-scale landowners showed sensitivity to proposed payments, with
landowners indicating a strong desire to participate in conservation
land-use as soon as the proposed financial incentives were sufficient to
cover their opportunity costs. Large-scale landowners showed little
sensitivity to payment size, and in general-with mode=10 and median=7
responses on a 10 point Likert-scale-indicated strong willingness to
participate in the PSA program under the proposed structure, even if
financial incentives per hectare were decreased significantly for large
investments of land, but prestige- and status-based awards were
introduced. These results are discussed in the context of an emerging
literature on signaling theory, conspicuous conservation, and the
interaction of financial incentives and social norms. (C) 2016 Elsevier

N2  - Community coalitions are a prominent organizational structure through
which community-based substance abuse prevention efforts are
implemented. There is little empirical evidence, however, regarding the
association between coalition attributes and success in achieving
community-level reductions in substance abuse behaviors. In this study,
we assessed the relationship between coalition capacity, based on
coalition coordinator responses to 16 survey items, and reductions in
underage drinking prevalence rates. The coalitions were funded through
the federally sponsored Strategic Prevention Framework State Incentive
Grant (SPF SIG). We first examined whether coalition capacity increased
over the life of the projects. Mean capacity scores increased for all 16
capacity items examined (N = 318 coalitions), the majority of which were
statistically significant. Analysis of the associations between capacity
and reductions in underage drinking was limited to coalitions that
targeted underage drinking and provided usable outcome measures based on
student survey data for either past 30-day alcohol use (N = 129) or
binge drinking (N = 100). Bivariate associations between the capacity
items and prevalence reductions for each outcome were consistently
positive, although many were not statistically significant. Composite
measures of correlated items were then created to represent six
different capacity constructs, and included in multivariate models to
predict reductions in the targeted outcomes. Constructs that
significantly predicted reductions in one or both outcome measures
included internal organization and structure, community connections and
outreach, and funding from multiple sources. The findings provide
support for the expectation that high functioning community coalitions
can be effective agents for producing desirable community-level changes
in targeted substance abuse behaviors.

N2  - Inappropriate waste disposal is a serious issue in many urban
neighborhoods, exacerbating environmental, rodent, and public health
problems. Governments all over the world have been developing
interventions to reduce inappropriate waste disposal. A system dynamics
model is proposed to quantify the impacts of interventions on
residential waste related behavior. In contrast to other models of
municipal solid waste management, the structure of our model is based on
sociological and economic studies on how incentives and social norms
interactively affect waste disposal behavior, and its parameterization
is informed by field work. A case study of low-income urban
neighborhoods in Baltimore, MD, USA is presented. The simulation results
show the effects of individual interventions, and also identify positive
interactions among some potential interventions, especially information
and incentive-based policies, as well as their limitations. The model
can help policy analysts identify the most promising intervention
packages, and then field test those few, rather than having to pilot
test all combinations. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate large
uncertainties about behavioral responses to some interventions, showing
where information from survey research and social experiments would
improve policy making. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

logistics information management, close-loop capability, supply chain
integration, supply chain coordination, conformity capability, and
institutional incentives. We examined three reverse logistics
strategies: joint reverse logistics, manufacturer reverse logistics, and
third-party reverse logistics. We conducted a survey of Chinese mobile

Results: Across rural and urban regions alike, among the AMI prevention
messages provided, participants identified the most important messages
to be: AMI can be potentially dangerous and life threatening; emergency
rooms should be used when experiencing an AMI; and doctors and
pharmacists should be consulted about AMI. The most common AMI
prevention barriers indicated were stigma, costs, and low perceived
risks. The most common AMI prevention motivators indicated were physical
health improvement, promoting a healthy lifestyle, convenient setting,
and financial incentives.
Conclusion: Regardless of geography, participants similarly rated the

N2  - The validity of survey research has been challenged by an alarming
increase in nonresponse rates over the past four decades. In reaction to
the public's increasing reluctance to participate in surveys, scholars
have focused on the reasons for, and consequences of, nonresponse.
However, children's participation in research is a neglected area of
study. We address this gap in the literature by examining parental
consent to allow their children to participate in the Youth Development
Study (YDS), an ongoing, multigenerational, longitudinal study. Of 411
parents contacted, 277 (67 percent) provided active consent. By
estimating a population average model with GEE, we find evidence that
the context of recruitment-whether the parent is being approached for
the first time, how the parent responded to prior child recruitment
efforts, and the provision of a monetary incentive-influences the
consent decision. The parent's relationship to the child (biological vs.
stepparent or other), participation in family decision-making, and
history of participation in YDS surveys are also associated with
consent. This research contributes to our understanding of parental
consent and indicates the need for further theoretical and empirical
work.

N2  - Our study examines cross-national variations in intergenerational
relations of partnered parents aged 50 and older with adult
non-coresident children by family structure (intact vs stepfamilies) and
parent-child relationship type (biological tie vs steprelation). We
focus on three European countries-France, Germany, and Russia-which have
in common a relatively large proportion of stepfamilies, but differ with
regard to contextual characteristics potentially impacting the
stepfamily-intergenerational-relations nexus.
The analysis is based on data from the Generations and Gender Survey
(Wave 1). Our pooled analytical sample consists of 14,309 parent-child
relationships derived from responses by 6,590 surveyed parents with
adult children living outside the parental household. We consider two
core dimensions of intergenerational solidarity as dependent variables,
namely frequency of contact and emotional closeness.
Our results support the notion of commonly weaker intergenerational
relations in stepfamilies. We also observe differences between
biological parent-child ties and steprelations. Compared with their
French and German counterparts, there is a weaker association between
having a steprelation and parent-child contact frequency as well as a
stronger negative correlation between having a steprelation and
emotional closeness among Russian respondents.
The observed cross-national differences are proposed to result from
different economic incentives to form a stepfamily, translating into a
stronger ``functional{''} basis of stepfamily intergenerational
relations in the Russian context.

N2  - Multidisciplinary tumour boards (MDTs) are conducted worldwide for the
management of patients with cancer, and they deliver a higher standard
of care by simultaneously involving different specialists in diagnosis
and treatment planning. However, information of paediatric MDTs
functioning is scarce. A pilot study was conducted in Spain in the frame
of the European Expert Paediatric Oncology Reference Network for
Diagnostics and Treatment (ExPO-r-Net).
A specific questionnaire was designed regarding various features of MDT
practice. Data collected included information on the centres and the
team, infrastructure for meetings, MDT organization/logistics and
clinical decision-making. The survey was distributed to all Paediatric
Oncology Units that register patients in the Spanish Registry of
Childhood Tumours (RETI-SEHOP).
32 out of 43 contacted centres responded the questionnaire (74 %
response rate; 88 % response rate for centres with > 25 new
patients/year). All units with > 25 new patients/year have a dedicated
Paediatric MDT compared to 76 % of units with aecurrency sign25 new
patients/year. MDTs should be improved at institutional level by clear
protected time in service planning for all specialists involved,
incentives for attendance and attendance registration. Clinical
decision-making process and follow-up of recommendation adherence should
be assessed and potential legal responsibilities for physicians
participating in Tumour Board defined. Network collaboration through
virtual MDTs, using available videoconferencing tools, is an opportunity
to share expertise among centres.

Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), Wildlife Habitat
Incentive Program (WHIP), and Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) were
introduced in the USA to create financial, educational, and technical
incentives to enhance conservation of natural resources. This study
examined Mississippi family forest owners' familiarity with CRP, EQIP,
WHIP, WRP, and conservation easements before the programmatic
reorganization brought about by the Farm Bill of 2014. The research also
determined the association of selected attitudinal and socioeconomic
characteristics with landowner familiarity. A mail survey was sent to
2025 randomly selected family forest owners in Mississippi and an
adjusted response rate of 37.1 % was obtained. Survey responses were
analyzed using descriptive statistics and five binary logistic
regression models were used to determine factors associated with
landowner familiarity with conservation programs. Familiarity with
conservation programs was positively associated with male landowners,
forest land size, forest and conservation organization membership, and
having a written forest management plan (p < 0.05). Findings suggest
that membership in forestry- and agriculture-based organizations can
help improve landowner knowledge of ecosystem services and enhance
familiarity with conservation programs.

N2  - Background: Most research on how to enhance response rates in physician
surveys has been done using paper surveys. Uncertainties remain
regarding how to enhance response rates in Internet-based surveys.
Objective: To evaluate the impact of a low-cost nonmonetary incentive
and paper mail reminders (formal letter and postcard) on response rates
in Internet-based physician surveys.
Methods: We executed a factorial-design randomized experiment while
conducting a nationally representative Internet-based physician survey.
We invited 3966 physicians (randomly selected from a commercial database
of all licensed US physicians) via email to complete an Internet-based
survey. We used 2 randomly assigned email messages: one message offered
a book upon survey completion, whereas the other did not mention the
book but was otherwise identical. All nonrespondents received several
email reminders. Some physicians were further assigned at random to
receive 1 reminder via paper mail (either a postcard or a letter) or no
paper reminder. The primary outcome of this study was the survey
response rate.
Results: Of the 3966 physicians who were invited, 451 (11.4%) responded
to at least one survey question and 336 (8.5%) completed the entire
survey. Of those who were offered a book, 345/2973 (11.6%) responded
compared with 106/993 (10.7%) who were not offered a book (odds ratio
1.10, 95% CI 0.87-1.38, P=.42). Regarding the paper mail reminder,
168/1572 (10.7%) letter recipients, 148/1561 (9.5%) postcard
recipients, and 69/767 (9.0%) email-only recipients responded (P=.35).
The response rate for those receiving letters or postcards was similar
(odds ratio 1.14, 95% CI 0.91-1.44, P=.26).
Conclusions: Offering a modest nonmonetary incentive and sending a paper
reminder did not improve survey response rate. Further research on how
to enhance response rates in Internet-based physician surveys is needed.

A survey of a population-based sample of U.S adults was conducted to
measure their attitudes about, and inform the design of the Precision
Medicine Initiative's planned national cohort study.
Methods
An online survey was conducted by GfK between May and June of 2015. The
influence of different consent models on willingness to share data was
examined by randomizing participants to one of eight consent scenarios.
Results
Of 4,777 people invited to take the survey, 2,706 responded and 2,601
(54% response rate) provided valid responses. Most respondents (79%)
supported the proposed study, and 54% said they would definitely or
probably participate if asked. Support for and willingness to
participate in the study varied little among demographic groups; younger
respondents, LGBT respondents, and those with more years of education
were significantly more likely to take part if asked. The most important
study incentive that the survey asked about was learning about one's own
health information. Willingness to share data and samples under broad,
study-by-study, menu and dynamic consent models was similar when a
statement about transparency was included in the consent scenarios.
Respondents were generally interested in taking part in several
governance functions of the cohort study.
Conclusions
A large majority of the U.S. adults who responded to the survey
supported a large national cohort study. Levels of support for the study
and willingness to participate were both consistent across most
demographic groups. The opportunity to learn health information about
one's self from the study appears to be a strong motivation to
participate.

N2  - There is an increasing number of neuroimaging studies using visual
sexual stimuli (VSS), especially within the emerging field of research
on compulsive sexual behaviors (CSB). A central question in this field
is whether behaviors such as excessive pornography consumption share
common brain mechanisms with widely studied substance and behavioral
addictions. Depending on how VSS are conceptualized, different
predictions can be formulated within the frameworks of Reinforcement
Learning or Incentive Salience Theory, where a crucial distinction is
made between conditioned and unconditioned stimuli (related to reward
anticipation vs. reward consumption, respectively). Surveying 40 recent
human neuroimaging studies we show existing ambiguity about the
conceptualization of VSS. Therefore, we feel that it is important to
address the question of whether VSS should be considered as conditioned
stimuli (cue) or unconditioned stimuli (reward). Here we present our own
perspective, which is that in most laboratory settings VSS play a role
of reward, as evidenced by: (1) experience of pleasure while watching
VSS, possibly accompanied by genital reaction; (2) reward-related brain
activity correlated with these pleasurable feelings in response to VSS;
(3) a willingness to exert effort to view VSS similarly as for other
rewarding stimuli such as money; and (4) conditioning for cues
predictive of VSS. We hope that this perspective article will initiate a
scientific discussion on this important and overlooked topic and
increase attention for appropriate interpretations of results of human
neuroimaging studies using VSS.

N2  - Objectives
To explain the use of feedback reports for quality improvements by the
reasons to participate in quality measuring projects and to identify
barriers and facilitators. Design Mixed methods design.
Methods
In 2009-2011 a national audit and feedback system for physical therapy
(Qualiphy) was initiated in the Netherlands. After each data collection
round, an evaluation survey was held amongst its participants. The
evaluation survey data was used to explain the use of feedback reports
by studying the reasons to participate with Qualiphy with correlation
measures and logistic regression. Semi-structured interviews with PTs
served to seek confirmation and disentangle barriers and facilitators.
Results
Analysis of 257 surveys (response rate: 42.8%) showed that therapists
with only financial reasons were less likely to use feedback reports (OR
= 0.24; 95% CI = 0.11-0.52) compared to therapists with a mixture of
reasons. PTs in 2009 and 2010 were more likely to use the feedback
reports for quality improvement than PTs in 2011 (OR = 2.41; 95% CI =
1.25-4.64 respectively OR = 3.28; 95% CI = 1.51-7.10). Changing
circumstances in 2011, i. e. using EHRs and financial incentives, had a
negative effect on the use of feedback reports (OR = 0.40, 95% CI =
0.20-0.78). Interviews with 12 physical therapists showed that feedback
reports could serve as a tool to support and structure quality
improvement plans. Barriers were distrust and perceived self-reporting
bias on indicator scores.
Conclusions
Implementing financial incentives that are not well-specified and
well-targeted can have an adverse effect on using feedback reports to
improve quality of care. Distrust is a major barrier to implementing
quality systems.

N2  - Background: There is sufficient evidence that monetary incentives are
effective in increasing survey response rates in the general population
as well as with physicians. The objective of this study was to assess
the impact of a monetary incentive intended for administrative
assistants on the survey response rate of physicians in leadership
positions.
Methods: This was an ancillary study to a national survey of chairs of
academic Departments of Medicine in the United States about measuring
faculty productivity. We randomized survey participants to receive or
not receive a $5 gift card enclosed in the survey package. The cover
letter explained that the gift card was intended for the administrative
assistants as a ``thank you for their time.{''} We compared the response
rates between the 2 study arms using the Chi-square test.
Results: Out of 152 participants to whom survey packages were mailed to,
a total of 78 responses were received (51 % response rate). The
response rates were 59 % in the incentive arm and 46 % in the no
incentive arm. The relative effect of the incentive compared to no
monetary incentive was borderline statistically significant (relative
risk (RR) = 1.36, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.99 to 1.87; p =
0.055).
Conclusion: Monetary incentives intended for administrative assistants
likely increase the response rate of physicians in leadership positions.

Methods. In 2012 and 2013, 8000 households in British Columbia, Canada,
were randomly allocated to 1 of 7 survey variants, each containing a
different combination of survey features. Features compared included
administration modes (paper vs online), prepaid incentive ($2 coin vs
none), lottery incentive (instant vs end-of-study), questionnaire length
(10 minutes vs 30 minutes), and sampling frame (InfoCanada vs Canada
Post).
Results. The overall response rate across the 7 groups was 27.9% (range
= 17.1-43.4). All survey features except the sampling frame were
associated with statistically significant differences in response rates.
The survey mode elicited the largest effect on the odds of response
(odds ratio {[}OR] = 2.04; 95% confidence interval {[}CI] = 1.61,
2.59), whereas the sampling frame showed the least effect (OR = 1.14;
95% CI = 0.98, 1.34). The highest response was achieved by mailing a
short paper survey with a prepaid incentive.
Conclusions. In a mailed general population health survey in Canada, a
40% to 50% response rate can be expected. Questionnaire administration
mode, survey length, and type of incentive affect response rates.

responsive and accountable to multiple demands in their local, national
and global contexts. Academics grapple to identify appropriate
organisational responses to the pressures of state steering and
incentive programmes. The empirical focus of the paper is a survey of
academics' community engagement activities, mapping their interaction
with external partners at five South African universities. The paper
addresses a basic question: Who are the academics that engage, and what
are their main academic influences? We argue that engagement is more
likely to lure the academic soul' when it is driven by substantive
growth in a disciplinary field and enhances reputations. The analysis
seeks to identify how disciplinary, institutional and positional
attributes are correlated with engaged activities. Luring the academic
soul' through an understanding of the influences on academics'
propensity to engage can facilitate more effectively targeted incentives

N2  - Sustainable management of hospital waste requires an active involvement
of all key players. This study aims to test the hypothesis that three
motivating factors, namely, Reputation, Liability, and Expense,
influence hospital waste management. The survey for this study was
conducted in two phases, with the pilot study used for exploratory
factor analysis and the subsequent main survey used for cross-validation
using confirmatory factor analysis. The hypotheses were validated
through one-sample t tests. Correlations were established between the
three motivating factors and organizational characteristics of hospital
type, location, category, and size. The hypotheses were validated, and
it was found that the factors of Liability and Expense varied
considerably with respect to location and size of a hospital. The factor
of Reputation, however, did not exhibit significant variation. In
conclusion, concerns about the reputation of a facility and an
apprehension of liability act as incentives for sound hospital waste
management, whereas concerns about financial costs and perceived
overburden on staff act as disincentives.Implications: This paper
identifies the non economic motivating factors that can be used to
encourage behavioral changes regarding waste management at hospitals in
resource constrained environments. This study discovered that
organizational characteristics such as hospital size and location cause
the responses to vary among the subjects. Hence a policy maker must take
into account the institutional setting before introducing a change
geared towards better waste management outcomes across hospitals. This
study covers a topic that has hitherto been neglected in resource
constrained countries. Thus it can be used as one of the first steps to
highlight and tackle the issue.

elements (HVEs) are expected to improve the triple aim.
Objective: The aim of this study is to understand whether focusing on
HVEs would improve patient experience with care.
Methods: Eight clinics were cluster-randomized in a year-long trial.
Both arms received practice facilitation, IT-based reporting, and
financial incentives. Intervention practices were encouraged to choose
HVEs for quality improvement goals. To assess patient experience, 1597
Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems surveys were
sent pretrial and posttrial to a stratified random sample of patients.
Difference-in-difference multivariate analysis was used to compare
patient responses from intervention and control practices, adjusting for
confounders.
Results: The response rate was 43% (n = 686). Nonrespondent analysis
showed no difference between arms, although differences were seen by
risk status and age. The overall difference in difference was 2.8%,
favoring the intervention. The intervention performed better in 9 of 11
composites. The intervention performed significantly better in follow-up

the intervention, and 8 of 11 for the control.
Discussion: Practices that targeted HVEs showed significantly more
improvement in patient experience of care. However, contemporaneous

N2  - Using firm-level survey responses from 2009 to 2012, we examine whether
competitors from the informal sector affect the credit constraints of
registered SMEs in 86 countries worldwide. We also investigate the role
played by the quality of institutional environment in exacerbating or in
alleviating such effect. A weak quality of institutional environment
strengthens inter-linkages between the formal and the informal sectors,
increases the costs and decreases the benefits assumed by formal firms,
and reduces the costs attributed to informality. Moreover, it also
results in a large informal economy, which influences perceptions about
the substitutability between formal and informal goods, and law evasion.
Our findings indicate that registered SMEs facing competition from
informal firms are more likely to be credit-constrained than other
formal SMEs that are not confronted with such competition. This result
is consistent with the ``parasite{''} view and the entrepreneurial
perspective of informality, which assert that informal firms are capable
of competing against registered SMEs and hurting the latter's profits.
Further, we find that such adverse impact manifests only in countries
with weak rule of law and high degree of corruption and bureaucracy. Our
results also show that registered micro and small firms are more likely
to be affected by the presence of informal firm competitors than
medium-sized firms. This is because the benefits of formality that
include access to credit from financial institutions, increase with firm
size. On the whole, our findings suggest that governments must enhance
their role in increasing access to credit to smaller firms and in
providing incentives for informal firms to be integrated in the formal
economy. Moreover, in order to achieve inclusive growth, our results
highlight the importance of improving the business environment, which
affects all entrepreneurs. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Adoption of drip irrigation in Kerala State of India is very low and
potential exists to increase its adoption in the State. A field survey
was conducted in two districts to determine the major factors
influencing farmers' adoption of drip irrigation and to draw conclusions
that will help in developing policy and institutional interventions to
encourage the adoption. The results indicated that adoption index of
farmers is higher in Kozhikode, when compared with the Thrissur
district. However, with respect to different crops, adoption index is
not statistically significant. Socioeconomic characteristics such as
age, education, experience, land holding size, etc. have a positive
influence on drip irrigation adoption index by farmers. Farmers have
realized yield improvement in the range of about 13% to 47% through
drip irrigation, when compared to surface method of irrigation for
arecanut, coconut and nutmeg. High productivity and income from
cultivation of crops like coconut, arecanut and nutmeg have acted as an
incentive to adopt the costly system of drip irrigation in the case of
both Kozhikode and Thrissur farmers. The number of drip irrigation
components and type of emitters indicated a significant and linear
response for drip irrigation adoption. The reported constraints
experienced by farmers include rainfall, clogging of drippers, high
initial cost, inadequate subsidy, difficulty in getting subsidy, etc.
This information will help to prioritize the factors that affect
adoption decisions and provide insights for improving the crop and water
productivity.

N2  - PurposeTo better understand the apparent persistent shortage of
registered nurses (RNs), including both aggregate trends and cyclical
responses.
DesignWe examine the employment of RNs over variations in economic
activity, employing national aggregate and unique micro-population data
on nurses in Arizona.
MethodsThese data, including our unique, ongoing survey of nurses in
Arizona, enable a systematic examination of the cyclical demand for
hospital care and institutional responses to that demand in the nursing
market by employing multivariate regressions.
FindingsDemand for hospital nursing care increases rapidly during the
early years of recessions, moderating as the economy improves. Hospitals
initially employ more temporary nurses, then reduce temporary hires by
shifting employed RNs from part time to full time while also adding RNs
not previously employed in hospitals. The substitution of regularly
employed RNs for temporary nurses reflects the need to reduce staffing
costs to offset increases in uncompensated care.
ConclusionsThe increased supply of nurses came from delayed retirements,
higher relative hospital wages (inducing nurses in other sectors to
return to hospitals), and added-worker effects. Additional nursing hours
were drawn from a pool of RNs who were not employed in health care.
Clinical RelevanceThese results strongly suggest that correctly aligned
incentives could reduce RN shortages without waiting for another
recession.

was designed to identify factors associated with the likelihood of
Georgia's obstetric trainees (obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN)
residents and certified nurse midwifery (CNM) students) to practice in
areas of Georgia that lack obstetric providers and services, i.e. rural
Georgia. Methods Pilot-tested electronic and paper surveys were
distributed to all of Georgia's OB/GYN residents (N = 95) and CNM
students (N = 28). Mixed-methods survey questions assessed
characteristics, attitudes, and incentives that might be associated with
trainee desire to practice in areas of Georgia that lack obstetric
providers and services. Surveys also gathered information about concerns
that may prevent trainees from practicing in shortage areas. Univariate
and bivariate analyses were performed, and qualitative themes were
abstracted from open-ended questions. Results The survey response rate
was 87.8 % (108/123). Overall, 24.4 % (19/78) of residents and 53.6 %
(15/28) of CNM students expressed interest in practicing in rural
Georgia, and both residents and CNM students were more likely to desire
to practice in rural Georgia with the offer of any of six financial
incentives (P < 0.001). Qualitative themes highlighted trainees' strong
concerns about Georgia's political environment as it relates to
reproductive healthcare. Conclusions Increasing state-level,
rurally-focused financial incentive programs and emphasizing the role of
CNMs may alleviate obstetric provider shortages in Georgia.

N2  - Background
The ubiquitous use of communication technologies has led to an
expectation that a similar approach should extend to health care.
Despite considerable rhetoric about the need for general practices to
offer alternatives to face-to-face consultations, such as telephone,
email, and internet video consultations, the extent to which such
technologies are actually used at present is unclear.
Aim
The aim of the survey was to identify the frequency and range of ways in
which general practices are providing (or planning) alternatives to
face-to-face consultations.
Design and setting
A postal survey of practices around Bristol, Oxford, Lothian, the
Highlands, and the Western Isles of Scotland.
Method
A postal questionnaire survey was sent to each of the GPs and practice
managers of 421 practices between January and May 2015.
Results
A response was received from 319/421 practices (76%). Although the
majority of the practices reported that they were conducting telephone
consultations frequently (n = 211/318, 66%), fewer were implementing
email consultations (n = 18/318, 6%), and most (n = 169/318, 53%) had
no plans to introduce this. None were currently using internet video,
and 86% (n = 273/318) had no plans to introduce internet video
consultations. These findings were repeated in the reported use of
alternatives to face-to-face consultations at an individual GP level.
Optional free text responses were completed by 28% of responders, and
offered an explanation for the (often perceived) barriers and incentives
for implementation.
Conclusion
Despite policy pressure to introduce consultations by email and internet
video, there is a general reluctance among GPs to implement alternatives
to face-to-face consultations. This identifies a substantial gap between
rhetoric and reality in terms of the likelihood of certain alternatives
(email, video) changing practice in the near future.

N2  - Background: Integrated care is defined as concerted action of healthcare
providers ensuring continuity of care within a patient-centered
approach, thus contributing to healthcare efficiency and quality. Apart
from the WHO/UNICEF Baby-Friendly Initiatives, integrated care has been
poorly explored within the context of breastfeeding support. The aim of
this study was to investigate the experience of breastfeeding support
practitioners, identifying barriers and facilitators towards integrated
care.
Methods: A 62-item survey was conducted among 900 participants at 3
international breastfeeding conferences. Analysis included uni-and
bivariate descriptive statistics, categorizing of mutually exclusive
response groups and thematic networks analysis of responses to 18
open-ended items.
Results: Three-hundred-and-one participants (33 % response), from 34
predominantly industrialized countries (98 %) on nearly all continents,
responded to the survey. Norwegian residents alone, felt sufficiently
supported in providing breastfeeding support by other healthcare
providers, the work environment, society, the media and their National
Breastfeeding Committee (P < 0.05). Out of 11 suggested measures for
effective breastfeeding promotion, 96 % of respondents ranked
integrated care as the most important. The largest response group
identified in open-ended items, as a major barrier to integrated care in
breastfeeding support, was ``lacking or failing health promotion
strategies{''} (n = 454), followed by ``a lack of vertically integrated
care{''} (n = 268), described mainly as unsatisfactory cooperation
within healthcare. This inconsistency of care also impairs ``shared
decision-making{''} on infant feeding for parents, including
accessibility of information and support (n = 265). Among other
measures, 29 % of respondents recommended incentivizing integrated
breastfeeding support within healthcare. Two figures, based on
open-ended response evaluations, illustrate participants' ideas of the
National Breastfeeding Committees' role in coordinating policies and
protagonists towards integrated breastfeeding support, and a
family-centered model of integrated care to facilitate successful
breastfeeding.
Conclusions: According to practitioners in breastfeeding support,
integrated care is essential for successful breastfeeding. Quality and
accessibility of breastfeeding support should be motivated by healthcare
system incentives, to counter the reported lack of consistency of care
within and beyond healthcare. To effectively integrate a continuum of
breastfeeding support into healthcare and society, a policy consensus
and strong political action are indispensable, with coordination by an
empowered National Breastfeeding Committee.

N2  - Family forest owners (FFOs) control a majority of private forestland in
the United States and have widely diverse ownership and management
objectives. Many FFOs manage their holdings for timber production and,
thus, are concerned with issues such as reforestation incentives and tax
treatment of timber revenues. Their actual knowledge of the tax aspects
of timber management varies, with some owners even unaware of the
federal income tax provisions that apply to timber. This research used
econometric techniques to establish socioeconomic predictors of FFO
awareness and use of federal income tax provisions. Socioeconomic
factors (such as size of forest holding, ownership objective, education,
age, and income) were evaluated in terms of association with awareness
and use of income tax provisions. Data were obtained from a survey of
1350 South Carolina FFOs (472 useable responses). A two-step sample
selection methodology revealed that membership in a landowner
organization and size of forest holding positively influence landowner
awareness of the seven tax provisions, while ownership objective and
level of education exhibited varying degrees of influence. Overall, the
findings suggest that size of forest holding is the key determinant that
influences landowner use of the provisions. These tax incentives are one
of the foundations of federal policies encouraging active forest
management by FFOs and the effectiveness of the various incentives has
crucial implications for forest policy analysis.

N2  - Objective: Health plans play a key role in facilitating improvements in
population health and may engage in activities that have an impact on
access, cost, and quality of behavioral health care. Although behavioral
health care is becoming more integrated with general medical care, its
delivery system has unique aspects. The study examined how health plans
deliver and manage behavioral health care in the context of the
Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the 2008 Mental Health Parity and
Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA). This is a critical time to examine how
health plans manage behavioral health care.
Methods: A nationally representative survey of private health plans
(weighted N=8,431 products; 89% response rate) was conducted in 2010
during the first year of MHPAEA, when plans were subject to the law but
before final regulations, and just before the ACA went into effect. The
survey addressed behavioral health coverage, cost-sharing, contracting
arrangements, medical home innovations, support for technology, and
financial incentives to improve behavioral health care.
Results: Coverage for inpatient and outpatient behavioral health
services was stable between 2003 and 2010. In 2010, health plans were
more likely than in 2003 to manage behavioral health care through
internal arrangements and to contract for other services. Medical home
initiatives were common and almost always included behavioral health,
but financial incentives did not. Some plans facilitated providers' use
of technology to improve care delivery, but this was not the norm.
Conclusions: Health plans are key to mainstreaming and supporting
delivery of high-quality behavioral health services. Since 2003, plans
have made changes to support delivery of behavioral health services in
the context of a rapidly changing environment.

General and Maori electoral rolls were randomized to receive a survey
pack with or without an offer of entry to a $500 prize draw. Subsequent
randomization of sample members who did not initially respond allowed

increase responses in either population. Contrary to expectation,
promising a $5 donation to non-respondents reduced subsequent

N2  - Disgust can evoke strong behavioral responses. Sometimes these extreme
visceral responses can lead to stigmatization an overreaction{''} to a
risk. In fact, disgust may be so inhibiting that it leads people to
refuse to consume completely safe items, such as treated drinking water,
leading to important economic and policy implications. Using economic
experiments, we provide a measure of the behavioral response to disgust.
Our findings suggest that when monetary incentives are provided, the
behavioral response may have been exaggerated by previous studies that
have relied on survey methods. Furthermore, mitigation steps
successfully reduce the stigma behavior. In fact, the results suggest
that stigma is primarily reduced not by a specific mitigation step taken
but by how many steps are taken consecutively. These results have
important implications for policies addressing issues such as the global
shortage of drinking water. Some efforts to resolve the shortage have
involved recycled water that is completely safe to drink but is often
rejected because of reactions of disgust. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier

prepaid cash, mailed prenotification plus a prepaid voucher, mailed
prenotification plus a postpaid voucher, and mailed prenotification on
its own as compared to a control group without prenotification or

nonresponse. Mailed prenotification over no prenotification increased
response and retention and decreased item nonresponse. Prenotification
plus prepaid cash maximized response and retention. Item nonresponse was
lowest with prenotification plus postpaid vouchers and second lowest
with prenotification plus prepaid cash. In addition, we compared the
cost for all experimental groups. Total costs were highest for
prenotification plus prepaid cash, but costs per respondent or per

N2  - The efficacy of the management of long-term conditions depends in part
on whether healthcare and health behaviours are complements or
substitutes in the health production function. On the one hand,
individuals might believe that improved health care can raise the
marginal productivity of their own health behaviour and decide to
complement health care with additional effort in healthier behaviours.
On the other hand, health care can lower the cost of unhealthy
behaviours by compensating for their negative effects. Individuals may
therefore reduce their effort in healthier lifestyles. Identifying which
of these effects prevails is complicated by the endogenous nature of
treatment decisions and individuals' behavioural responses. We explore
whether the introduction in 2004 of the Quality and Outcomes Framework
(QOF), a financial incentive for family doctors to improve the quality
of healthcare, affected the population's weight, smoking and drinking
behaviours by applying a sharp regression discontinuity design to a
sample of 32,102 individuals in the Health Survey for England
(1997-2009). We find that individuals with the targeted health
conditions improved their lifestyle behaviours. This complementarity was
only statistically significant for smoking, which reduced by 0.7
cigarettes per person per day, equal to 18% of the mean. We investigate
whether this change was attributable to the QOF by testing for other
discontinuity points, including the introduction of a smoking ban in
2007 and changes to the QOF in 2006. We also examine whether medication
and smoking cessation advice are potential mechanisms and find no
statistically significant discontinuities for these aspects of health
care supply. Our results suggest that a general improvement in
healthcare generated by provider incentives can have positive unplanned
effects on patients' behaviours. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by

N2  - There is an extensive body of research on the determinants of disaster
preparedness at the individual and household levels. The same cannot be
said for the organizational level. Hence, the purpose of this study is
to shed light on the predictors of organizational preparedness for
natural disasters. Since leaders of organizations have an incentive to
overstate their level of preparedness and because surveys of
organizational leaders suffer from selection bias and low response
rates, we take the novel approach of interviewing employees about the
organizations that employ them. Using an online survey, we collected
information from a national sample of 2,008 U.S. employees and estimated
the predictors of preparedness at the organizational level. We find,
among other results, that organization size (facility level) is a
consistent predictor of preparedness at the organizational level. We
conclude with policy recommendations and outline an agenda for future
research on organizational preparedness for natural disasters.

N2  - Background: Despite strong support for its efficacy, debates persist
about how dissemination of contingency management is most effectively
undertaken. Currently-promoted contingency management methods are
empirically-validated, yet their congruence with interests and
preferences of addiction treatment clientele is unknown. Such client
input is a foundational support for evidence-based clinical practice.
Objective: This study documented interest in incentives and preferences
for fixed-ratio vs. variable-ratio and immediate vs. distal distribution
of earned incentives among clients enrolled at three community programs
affiliated with the National Institute on Drug Abuse Clinical Trials
Network. Methods: This multi-site study included anonymous survey
completion by an aggregate sample of 358 treatment enrollees. Analyses
first ruled out site differences in survey responses, and then tested
age and gender as influences on client interest in financial incentives,
and preferences for fixed-ratio vs. variable-ratio reinforcement and
immediate vs. distal incentive distribution. Results: Interest in
different types of $50 incentives (i.e. retail vouchers, transportation
vouchers, cash) was highly inter-correlated, with a mean sample rating
of 3.49 (0.83) on a five-point scale. While consistent across client
gender, age was an inverse predictor of client interest in incentives. A
majority of clients stated preference for fixed-ratio incentive
magnitude and distal incentive distribution (67% and 63%,
respectively), with these preferences voiced by a larger proportion of
females. Conclusion: Sample preferences contradict currently-promoted
contingency management design features. Future efforts to disseminate
contingency management may be more successful if flexibly undertaken in
a manner that incorporates the interests and preferences of local client
populations.

N2  - Background: Worksite health promotion (WHP) initiatives are increasingly
seen as having potential for large-scale health gains. While health
insurance premiums are directly linked to workplaces in the USA, other
countries with universal health coverage, have less incentive to
implement WHP programs. Size of the business is an important
consideration with small worksites less likely to implement WHP
programs. The aim of this study was to identify key intervention points
and to provide policy makers with evidence for targeted interventions.
Methods: The worksites (n = 218) of randomly selected, working
participants, aged between 30 and 65 years, in two South Australian
cohort studies were surveyed to assess the practices, beliefs, and
attitudes regarding WHP. A survey was sent electronically or by mail to
management within each business.
Results: Smaller businesses (< 20 employees) had less current health
promotion activies (mean 1.0) compared to medium size businesses (20-200
employees -mean 2.4) and large businesses (200+ employees -mean 2.9).
Management in small businesses were less likely (31.0 %) to believe
that health promotion belonged in the workplace (compared to 55.7 % of
medium businesses and 73.9 % of large businesses) although half of
small businesses did not know or were undecided (compared to 36.4 and
21.6 % of medium and large businesses). In total, 85.0 % of smaller
businesses believed the health promotion activities currently employed
in the worksite were effective (compared to 89.2 % of medium businesses
and 83.1 % of large businesses). Time and funding were themost cited
responses to the challenges to implementing health promoting strategies
regardless of business size. Small businesses ranked morale and
work/life balance the highest among a range of health promotion
activities that were important for their workplace while work-related
injury was the highest ranked consideration for large businesses.
Conclusion: This study found that smaller workplaces had many barriers,
beliefs and challenges regarding WHP. Often small businesses find health
promotion activities a luxury and not a serious focus of their
activities although this study found that once a health promoting
strategy was employed, the perceived effectiveness of the activities
were high for all business regardless of size. Tailored low-cost
programs, tax incentives, re-orientation of work practices and
management support are required so that the proportion of small
businesses that have WHP initiatives is increased.

success of clinical trials, particularly for studies requiring data
collected from subjects at home or other remote sites. A multifaceted
strategy for data collection in a randomized controlled trial (RCT)
focused on care coordination for children with medical complexity is
described. The influences of data collection mode, incentives, and study
group membership on subject response patterns are analyzed. Data
collection included monthly healthcare service utilization (HCSU)
calendars and annual surveys focused on care coordination
outcomes.Materials and Methods:One hundred sixty-three families were
enrolled in the 30-month TeleFamilies RCT. Subjects were 2-15 years of
age at enrollment. HCSU data were collected by parent/guardian
self-report using mail, e-mail, telephone, or texting. Surveys were
collected by mail. Incentives were provided for completed surveys after
8 months to improve collection returns. Outcome measures were the number
of HCSU calendars and surveys returned, the return interval, data
collection mode, and incentive impact. Results:Return rates of 90% for
HCSU calendars and 82% for annual surveys were achieved. Mean return
intervals were 72 and 65 days for HCSU and surveys, respectively. Survey
response increased from 55% to 95% after introduction of a gift card
and added research staff.Conclusions:High return rates for HCSU
calendars and health-related surveys are attainable but required a
flexible and personnel-intensive approach to collection methods. Family
preference for data collection approach should be obtained at
enrollment, should be modified as needed, and requires flexible options,
training, intensive staff/family interaction, and patience.

N2  - While it has been established in previous research that public support
for air services to peripheral or economically underdeveloped regions is
justifiable, the current EU Public Service Obligation (PSO) air service
mechanism and particularly, the level of competition for PSO contracts,
can be improved. This paper sets out to identify best practice for PSO
contract sponsors by viewing issues from an air operator perspective.
The heart of this paper is a survey of European regional airlines. We
examine the airline managers' perspectives in relation to assessing and
bidding for PSOs on scheduled air services. Possible areas for
improvement include issues around the dissemination of PSO opportunities
in the single market, adequate response times for proposal
preparation/submission and preparing for the service launch date as well
as incentives to develop the air service during the contract period in
terms of revenue and patronage. We also highlight issues related to
entry barriers, risk sharing, transparency and effectiveness of PSO
contract awarding procedures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

N2  - Identifying ways to efficiently maximize the response rate to surveys is
important in survey-based research. However, evidence on the response
rate effect of donation incentives and especially altruistic and
egotistic text appeal interventions is sparse and ambiguous. Via a
randomized survey experiment among 6,162 members of an online survey
panel, this article shows how low-cost incentives and cost-free text
appeal interventions may affect the survey response rate in online
panels. The experimental treatments comprise (a) a cash prize lottery
incentive, (b) two donation incentives that promise a monetary donation
to a good cause in return for survey response, (c) an egotistic text
appeal, and (d) an altruistic text appeal. Relative to a control group,
we find higher response rates among recipients of the egotistic text
appeal and the lottery incentive. Donation incentives yield lower
response rates.

N2  - Redundancy is a four-letter word. According to courts and scholars,
redundant litigation is costly, unfair, and confounding. Modern civil
procedure has a ( nearly) maximalist preference for centralization, and
various rules seek to limit duplicative suits within and across court
systems. This seemingly dominant view stands in marked contrast to the
reality of the modern regulatory state. Redundant public-private
enforcement, in which public and private actors have overlapping
authority to enforce the law, is ubiquitous. Redundant enforcement also
is noticeably underrepresented in the substantial literature on private
and public enforcement, which typically treats government agencies and
private attorneys general as substitutes rather than complements.
This Article seeks to fill these gaps. It begins with a survey of the
myriad forms of redundant enforcement in U.S. law, and then turns to a
defense of redundant public-private enforcement. Scholars of engineering
and public administration have built up a powerful literature on the
potential uses of redundancy, and this Article applies those insights to
overlapping public and private enforcement in U.S. law. Drawing on those
literatures, this Article derives principles of redundant enforcement
that account for the diversity of agents and the potential for strategic
behavior. It argues that redundancy may be an effective response to
errors, resource constraints, information problems, and agency costs, if
redundant-enforcement regimes harness multiple diverse agents and are
tailored to the relevant regulatory environment. Specifically, if the
lawmaker worries that public or private agents are missing good cases,
redundant authority may help to reduce errors, increase resources,
aggregate information, and improve monitoring-though permitting
duplicative suits may undercut these gains. Meanwhile, if the lawmaker
is concerned about under-enforcing settlements or judgments,
symmetrically non-preclusive redundant litigation may be a valuable
tool-though damages should offset to avoid multiple punishments, and
procedural rules should maintain incentives and allocate cases.

N2  - Grain legume production in Europe has decreased in recent years, while
legume demand has rapidly increased due to growth of meat production.
Therefore, Europe imports grain legumes, principally soybeans, to meet
feed protein requirements. Various investigations have identified
problems and benefits of local grain legume cultivation. Nevertheless,
grain legume cultivation has still not increased in the last years.
Studies investigating why farmers do not cultivate grain legumes are
missing. Here, we surveyed the knowledge of farmers about grain legume
cultivation, problems and constraints of grain legume cultivation and
the barriers faced by and incentives needed by farmers. We sent a
questionnaire to 1373 farmers in Luxembourg, with a response rate of 29
%. Results show that only 17 % of all the responding farmers
cultivated grain legumes; 88 % of the conventional farmers did not
cultivate grain legumes, while 85 % of the organic farmers did. We
observed that Luxembourgish farmers feel badly informed about grain
legume cultivation; organic farmers generally feel better informed than
their conventional colleagues. The main barrier, named by Luxemburgish
farmers to not cultivate grain legumes, is not economic issues but a
lack of knowledge and extension services for these crops. Main
incentives needed to start grain legume cultivation in the future are
economic issues. Even though grain legume producers mentioned several
negative experiences with grain legume cultivation, they are not
discouraged by the poor economic conditions and appreciate the benefits
of grain legume cultivation. Overall, our findings show that research
results on grain legume should be better disseminated to extension
services and farmers.

N2  - Context:
Health information technology (IT) has the potential to improve the
nation's public health infrastructure. In support of this belief,
meaningful use incentives include criteria for hospitals to
electronically report to immunization registries, as well as to public
health agencies for reportable laboratory results and syndromic
surveillance. Electronic reporting can facilitate faster and more
appropriate public health response. However, it remains unclear the
extent that hospitals have adopted IT for public health efforts.
Objective:
To examine hospital adoption of IT for public health and to compare
hospitals capable of using and not using public health IT.
Design:
Cross-sectional design with data from the 2012 American Hospital
Association annual survey matched with data from the 2013 American
Hospital Association Information Technology Supplement. Multivariate
logistic regression was used to compare hospital characteristics.
Inverse probability weights were applied to adjust for selection bias
because of survey nonresponse.
Participants:
All acute care general hospitals in the United States that matched
across the surveys and had complete data available were included in the
analytic sample.
Main Outcome Measures:
Three separate outcome measures were used: whether the hospital could
electronically report to immunization registries, whether the hospital
could send electronic laboratory results, and whether the hospital can
participate in syndromic surveillance.
Results:
A total of 2841 hospitals met the inclusion criteria. Weighted results
show that of these hospitals, 62.7% can electronically submit to
immunization registries, 56.6% can electronically report laboratory
results, and 54.4% can electronically report syndromic surveillance.
Adjusted and weighted results from the multivariate analyses show that
small, rural hospitals and hospitals without electronic health record
systems lag in the adoption of public health IT capabilities.
Conclusion:
While a majority of hospitals are using public health IT, the
infrastructure still has significant room for growth. Differences in
hospitals' adoption of public health IT may exacerbate existing health
disparities.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: From 2009 to 2010, 12 accountable care organizations (ACOs)
entered into the alternative quality contract (AQC), BlueCross
BlueShield of Massachusetts's global payment arrangement. The AQC
included 6 outpatient pediatric quality measures among 64 total measures
tied to pay-for-performance bonuses and incorporated pediatric
populations in their global budgets. We characterized the pediatric
infrastructure of these adult-oriented ACOs and obtained leaders'
perspectives on their ACOs' response to pediatric incentives.
METHODS: We used Massachusetts Health Quality Partners and American
Hospital Association Survey data to characterize ACOs' pediatric
infrastructure as extremely limited, basic, and substantial on the basis
of the extent of pediatric primary care, outpatient specialist, and
inpatient services. After ACOs had 16 to 43 months of experience with
the AQC, we interviewed 22 leaders to gain insight into how
organizations made changes to improve pediatric care quality, tried to
reduce pediatric spending, and addressed care for children with special
health care needs.
RESULTS: ACOs' pediatric infrastructure ranged from extremely limited
(eg, no general pediatricians in their primary care workforce) to
substantial (eg, 42% of workforce was general pediatricians). Most
leaders reported intensifying their pediatric quality improvement
efforts and witnessing changes in quality metrics; most also
investigated pediatric spending patterns but struggled to change
patients' utilization patterns. All reported that the AQC did little to
incentivize care for children with special health care needs and that
future incentive programs should include this population.
CONCLUSIONS: Although ACOs involved in the AQC were adult-oriented, most
augmented their pediatric quality improvement and spending reduction
efforts when faced with pediatric incentives.

N2  - Background: Recent years have seen significant growth in part-time work
among pharmacy personnel. If preferences and outlooks of part-time and
full-time workers differ, job-related incentives may not have the same
effect on both groups; different management practices may be necessary
to cope with rapidly evolving workforces.
Objective: To compare wage-and-salary responses to the number of hours
worked, human-capital stock, and job-related preferences between
full-time and part-time pharmacists. The analysis focused on the
pharmacist workforce because, unlike other professions, remuneration is
fairly linear with respect to the amount of time worked.
Methods: Data were collected from a self-reported survey of licensed
pharmacists in southern Florida (U.S. State). The sample consisted of
979 full-time and 254 part-time respondents. Using ordinary least
squares, a model estimated, separately for full-time and part-time
pharmacists, annual wage-and-salary earnings as functions of average
workweek, human-capital stock, and job-related preferences.
Results: Practitioners working less than 36 h/week were driven almost
exclusively by pay, whereas practitioners working 36 h or more exhibited
a more comprehensive approach to their work experience that included
variables beyond monetary remuneration.
Conclusion: Managing part-time pharmacists calls for emphasis on
wage-and-salary issues. Job-security and gender-and children-related
concerns, such as flexibility, should be oriented toward full-time
practitioners. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - A decentralized approach to encourage the voluntary adoption of
household stormwater management practices is increasingly needed to
mitigate urban runoff and to comply with more stringent water quality
regulations. We analyze the household response to a hypothetical rebate
program to incentivize rain garden adoption using household survey data
from the Baltimore-Washington corridor. We asked respondents whether the
household would adopt a rain garden without a rebate or when offered a
randomly assigned rebate. An interval-data model is used to estimate
household demand on the willingness to pay (WTP) for a rain garden as a
function of demographic factors, gardening activities, environmental
attitudes, and other household characteristics. Estimation results
indicate that mean WTP for a rain garden in our sample population is
approximately $6.72 per square foot, corresponding to almost
three-fourths of the installation cost. The expected adoption rate more
than tripled when comparing no rebate versus a government rebate set at
one-third of the installation cost, indicating that economic incentives
matter. There is substantial heterogeneity in the WTP among households.
Higher levels of WTP are estimated for households with higher
environmental concern for the Chesapeake Bay and local streams, garden
experience, higher income, and non-senior citizen adults. We conclude
that a cost-share rebate approach is likely to significantly affect
household adoption decisions, and the partial contributions paid by
households can assist with lowering the substantial compliance costs for
local governments to meet water quality requirements.

N2  - E. coli O157:H7 is an important source of foodborne disease. The E. coli
pathogen occurs naturally within the rumen of livestock (including
cattle) and does not affect the health of the cattle, however, can be a
source of cross-contamination during food processing or environmental
contamination of drinking and irrigation water supplies. A vaccine to
reduce the risk of cattle shedding E. coli is licensed for use in Canada
and the US, however, adoption of the vaccine by cattle producers has
been extremely low. Using data from a survey of cow calf producers in
western Canada, the influence of a set of thirteen incentives to
encourage adoption of the vaccine is examined using Best Worst Scaling.
Incentives include policy interventions, market/supply chain incentives,
production protocol incentives, and producer reputation incentives.
Heterogeneity in producer responses to the incentives is evident and is
further explored with a Latent Class Cluster analysis. Results suggest
that a `one size fits all' policy to encourage adoption of an E. coli
vaccine by cattle producers may be challenging. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Modern construction projects often include incentive/disincentive (I/D)
provisions in order to serve a variety of different client objectives.
Studies have shown both the advantages and disadvantages of using I/D
clauses to improve performance. In India, out of 82 construction
projects of varied size and nature investigated, only 14 projects of a
critical nature were found to have I/D clauses in their contract
document. The present study was carried out to identify various
attributes affecting the successful use of I/D clauses in achieving
their intended purpose. A total of 25 attributes were identified based
on a literature review and structured personal interviews that present
practical difficulties while using the I/D contracting method and thus,
prevent I/D clauses from unlocking their true potential. These
attributes have been evaluated based on the results of a survey
conducted among experienced professionals working in the Indian
construction industry. Factor analysis conducted on responses associated
with important attributes identified five key factors: difficulty in
contract management, additional effort by project participants, adverse
effect on the working relationship of the client and contractor,
increased responsibility of the client, and client's reluctant top
management. These factors also explain the reason behind the low
acceptance of the I/D contracting method in developing construction
markets. Case studies performed in four construction projects show that
three out of four projects discussed were delayed due to inadequate
understanding and wrong implementation of I/D provisions. This paper
will be of interest to academicians and practitioners interested in the
use of the I/D contracting method in construction projects. (C) 2015

N2  - Background: Childhood obesity is a concern in Australia and across the
world. Community-based weight management programs are an important
response to address childhood obesity. However, the scientific
literature suggests that their effectiveness could potentially be
enhanced by providing a structured incentive scheme. This proposal aims
to determine the effectiveness of enhanced goal setting linked to a
structured incentive scheme designed to improve the sustained health and
wellbeing of overweight/obese children within the context of an existing
community-based program.
Methods/Design: This study is a cluster randomized controlled trial
delivered within the context of the existing NSW ``Go4Fun{''} program
with a 10-week and 6-and 12-month follow-up (n = 40 sites, 570
participants) that compares the effectiveness of small changes to the
program in which children were asked to set goals (supported by text
messages) and were given rewards for achieving them (intervention). This
will be compared to the standard/existing program (control), which did
not have the same structured incentive program. Data will be collected
for all participants at baseline, end of program, and at 6 and 12
months. The primary outcome is a mean change in body mass index (BMI) z
score at the 12-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes include
anthropometric measures (body weight, height, and waist circumference)
and behavioral measures collected via validated questionnaires. A
process evaluation (comprising surveys and focus groups) to determine
acceptability and sustainability and to inform downstream translation
will also be conducted.
Discussion: This study will inform policy and program delivery as well
as the broader evidence base regarding goal achievement and incentive
schemes directed at children's health-related behaviors and will provide
evidence that is likely to be transferrable across a range of health
conditions.

N2  - Background: With the widespread use of information communication
technologies, computerized clinical practice guidelines are developed
and considered as effective decision supporting tools in assisting the
processes of clinical activities. However, the development of
computerized clinical practice guidelines in Taiwan is still at the
early stage and acceptance level among major users (physicians) of
computerized clinical practice guidelines is not satisfactory. This
study aims to investigate critical factors influencing physicians'
intention to computerized clinical practice guideline use through an
integrative model of activity theory and the technology acceptance
model.
Methods: The survey methodology was employed to collect data from
physicians of the investigated hospitals that have implemented
computerized clinical practice guidelines. A total of 505 questionnaires
were sent out, with 238 completed copies returned, indicating a valid
response rate of 47.1 %. The collected data was then analyzed by
structural equation modeling technique.
Results: The results showed that attitudes toward using computerized
clinical practice guidelines (gamma = 0.451, p < 0.001), organizational
support (gamma = 0.285, p < 0.001), perceived usefulness of computerized
clinical practice guidelines (gamma = 0.219, p < 0.05), and social
influence (gamma = 0.213, p < 0.05) were critical factors influencing
physicians' intention to use computerized clinical practice guidelines,
and these factors can explain 68.6 % of the variance in intention to
use computerized clinical practice guidelines.
Conclusions: This study confirmed that some subject (human) factors,
environment (organization) factors, tool (technology) factors mentioned
in the activity theory should be carefully considered when introducing
computerized clinical practice guidelines. Managers should pay much
attention on those identified factors and provide adequate resources and
incentives to help the promotion and use of computerized clinical
practice guidelines. Through the appropriate use of computerized
clinical practice guidelines, the clinical benefits, particularly in
improving quality of care and facilitating the clinical processes, will
be realized.

JF  - HEALTH RESEARCH POLICY AND SYSTEMS

N2  - Background: The interest and activity in measuring and reporting the
impact of publicly funded health and medical research has grown rapidly
in recent years. Research evaluation typically relies on researchers for
much of the information for an impact assessment. However, the
acceptability and feasibility of this activity among health researchers
is unknown. The aim of this study was to understand the role and
opinions of cancer researchers in the growing area of impact evaluation
activity, to inform the logistics of a sustainable program of impact
evaluation.
Methods: A brief anonymous online survey was administered to 95 current
and past grant recipients funded through the external grants program at
Cancer Council New South Wales. Eleven survey statements were
constructed with Likert responses and supplemented with two open-ended
questions. The statements covered the conceptual, attitudinal and
practical aspects of impact evaluation. The survey targeted researchers
from the full spectrum of cancer control research classifications.
Descriptive analyses obtained response frequencies and percentages.
Results: Forty-five cancer researchers completed the survey (response
rate 47%) and 77% were Associate Professors or Professors. Responses
were polarised for questions relating to engaging with research
end-users, perceived time-pressure to collate data, and pressure to
produce research outputs. Some researchers emphasised that quality was
an important goal over quantity and warned that collecting impact data
created incentives and disincentives for researchers.
Conclusion: There was mixed support and acceptance among senior cancer
researchers in Australia on their perceived role and engagement with
research impact activities. Sole reliance on researchers for collating
and reporting impact data may be problematic. Requesting information
from researchers could be minimised and confined to final reports and
possible verification of externally-led evaluations.

N2  - The tobacco epidemic disproportionately affects low-income populations,
and telehealth is an evidence-based strategy for extending tobacco
cessation services to underserved populations. A public health priority
is to establish incentive-based interventions at the population level in
order to promote long-term smoking cessation in low-income populations.
Yet randomized clinical trials show that financial incentives tend to
encourage only short-term steps of cessation, not continuous smoking
abstinence. One potential mechanism for increasing long-term cessation
is interpersonal communication (IPC) in response to population-level
interventions. However, more research is needed on IPC and its influence
on health behavior change, particularly in the context of
incentive-based, population-level programs. This study used survey data
gathered after a population-level telehealth intervention that offered
$20 incentives to low-income smokers for being connected to Minnesota's
free quitline in order to examine how perceived incentive importance and
IPC about the incentive-based program relate to both short-term and
long-term health behavior change. Results showed that IPC was strongly
associated with initial quitline utilization and continuous smoking
abstinence as measured by 30-day point prevalence rates at 7-month
follow-up. Perceived incentive importance had weak associations with
both measures of cessation, and all associations were nonsignificant in
models adjusting for IPC. These results were found in descriptive
analyses, logistic regression models, and Heckman probit models that
adjusted for participant recruitment. In sum, a behavioral telehealth
intervention targeting low-income smokers that offered a financial
incentive inspired IPC, and this social response was strongly related to
utilization of intervention services as well as continuous smoking
abstinence.

N2  - Purpose - The purpose of this study was to provide a holistic view of
exhibition destination attractiveness by examining perceptions of two of
the three key stakeholders (exhibition organizers and visitors) and
contrasting them with those of exhibitors.
Design/methodology/approach - This research used a mixed method
approach, collecting 535 responses from visitors attending nine
business-to-business exhibitions in four major cities in China via
structured surveys. In addition, eight in-depth interviews with
CEOs/owners of leading global and Chinese exhibition companies were
conducted.
Findings - The findings revealed that exhibitors may go almost anywhere
where there is potential for successful business. In contrast, visitors
prefer exhibition destinations with good accessibility to minimize
travel time and an attractive leisure environment that offers a degree
of enjoyment in addition to taking care of business. A destination's
``economic environment{''} and ``cluster effects{''} were comparatively
less important to them. Organizers were cognizant of these differences,
contributing to their reluctance in taking large-scale, branded
exhibitions to second-tier destinations, despite considerable efforts by
these cities to improve their infrastructure.
Practical implications - This study offers practical guidelines for
destination administrators and exhibition organizers with regard to
evaluating destination resources for long-term exhibition development.
Originality/value - In contrast to prior studies, this research
identifies significant differences in perceptions of exhibition
destination attractiveness among all three key industry stakeholders. It
also presents a persuasive case for the need to clearly differentiate
between the attractiveness of a destination for attracting/hosting
exhibitions versus conventions, rather than approaching the subject from
a more generic meetings, incentives, conferences, and exhibitions (MICE)
segment/business events perspective.

Challenges included some student misperceptions about the assessment
innovation, and the difficulty of assessing the short responses
efficiently and reliably. The analysis suggests that starting small is a
useful principle for assessment change. The discussion also brings out
some wider issues of incentives and barriers for assessment innovation,

Design/methodology/approach - Mixed methods study pairing data from a
cross-sectional National Survey of ACOs with in-depth, semi-structured
interviews with leaders from 11 ACOs (both completed in 2013).
Findings - Early ACOs vary widely in their electronic health record,
data integration, and analytic capabilities. The most common HIT
capability was drug-drug and drug-allergy interaction checks, with 53.2
percent of respondents reporting that the ACO possessed the capability
to a high degree. Outpatient and inpatient data integration was the
least common HIT capability (8.1 percent). In the interviews, ACO
leaders commented on different HIT development strategies to gain a more
comprehensive picture of patient needs and service utilization. ACOs
realize the necessity for robust data analytics, and are exploring a
variety of approaches to achieve it.
Research limitations/implications - Data are self-reported. The
qualitative portion was based on interviews with 11 ACOs, limiting
generalizability to the universe of ACOs but allowing for a range of
responses.
Practical implications - ACOs are challenged with the development of
sophisticated HIT infrastructure. They may benefit from targeted
assistance and incentives to implement health information exchanges with
other providers to promote more coordinated care management for their
patient population.
Originality/value - Using new empirical data, this study increases
understanding of the extent of ACOs' current and developing HIT
capabilities to support ongoing care management.

N2  - Research on trustworthiness and trust behavior so far has followed
different methodological approaches and has generated conflicting
evidence regarding their interrelationships. While several authors
follow the definition of trustworthiness as a belief or a formed
expectancy by Person A about Person B to do X (usually to reward trust),
different hypotheses can be derived regarding its formation, depending
on whether one treats trustworthiness as incentive-based or as a
propensity or disposition. Additionally, distinct measurement approaches
for trustworthiness exist, depending on the mode of data collection.
With theoretical claims that trustworthiness represents ``the crucial
variable{''} (Hardin in Trust, 2006) for understanding and explaining
successful cooperation based on trust, the article proposes the use of
para-data in the form of response latency measurement to enhance the
understanding of the thought processes behind forming an assessment of
trustworthiness. The study uses pooled data from two CATI surveys
conducted in Germany in 2012 to test hypotheses on the underlying
cognitive process of forming an expectation of trustworthiness by
applying the techniques of both response latency measurement and Cox
regression models. We find that the applied survey measures of
trustworthiness generate inconsistent results regarding the underlying
process of forming expectations. Consequences for future research are
discussed.

confirmation (PC) has not been validated in cessation trials. We
assessed the feasibility and validity of PC in a cessation trial for
hospitalized smokers.
Methods: We enrolled 402 daily cigarette smokers during a hospital
admission. At enrollment, participants provided demographics, smoking
history, and named proxies to confirm their smoking status at follow-up.
Participants provided self-reported (SR) 7-day tobacco abstinence by
telephone at 6 months post-discharge. SR quitters were asked to mail a
saliva sample for BC. Incentives were offered for survey completion ($
20) and returned samples ($ 50). We called proxies for all those with
SR to obtain PC. Quit rates were calculated with missing data indicating
smoking. We assessed associations of nonresponse with baseline
characteristics using chi-squared tests and logistic regression. We
calculated the sensitivity and specificity of PC in detecting smokers as
determined by BC.
Results: All patients named at least one proxy. Response rates were 82%
for SR, 84% for PC, and 69% for BC. Observed participant
characteristics were unrelated to provision of sample for BC. Estimated
quit rates were 35% for SR, 27% for SR + PC, 21% for SR + BC and 27%
for SR + BC or PC. Sensitivity of PC was not higher than SR (73% vs.
77%); specificity was lower (84% vs. 100%).
Conclusion: PC was feasible but not superior to self-report in a
cessation trial.

N2  - PURPOSE In the turbulent US health care environment, many primary care
physicians seek hospital employment. Large physician-owned primary care
groups are an alternative, but few physicians or policy makers realize
that such groups exist. We wanted to describe these groups, their
advantages, and their challenges.
METHODS We identified 21 groups and studied 5 that varied in size and
location. We conducted interviews with group leaders, surveyed randomly
selected group physicians, and interviewed external observers-leaders of
a health plan, hospital, and specialty medical group that shared
patients with the group. We triangulated responses from group leaders,
group physicians, and external observers to identify key themes.
RESULTS The groups' physicians work in small practices, with the group
providing economies of scale necessary to develop laboratory and imaging
services, health information technology, and quality improvement
infrastructure. The groups differ in their size and the extent to which
they engage in value-based contracting, though all are moving to
increase the amount of financial risk they take for their quality and
cost performance. Unlike hospital-employed and multispecialty groups,
independent primary care groups can aim to reduce health care costs
without conflicting incentives to fill hospital beds and keep specialist
incomes high. Each group was positively regarded by external observers.
The groups are under pressure, however, to sell to organizations that
can provide capital for additional infrastructure to engage in
value-based contracting, as well as provide substantial income to
physicians from the sale.
CONCLUSIONS Large, independent primary care groups have the potential to
make primary care attractive to physicians and to improve patient care
by combining human scale advantages of physician autonomy and the small
practice setting with resources that are important to succeed in
value-based contracting.

N2  - In a foreign policy crisis between a strong and weak state, do citizens
of the weaker party punish or reward a leader that escalates the crisis?
Strong evidence suggests that there were electoral incentives for
Georgian escalation in its August 2008 war with Russia. This article
combines data from survey experiments, conducted on Georgian voters just
weeks prior to the August 2008 war, with open-ended survey response
questions from a survey fielded just weeks after the war. Respondents
evaluated their leader's crisis behavior in the aftermath of a real war
differently than the evidence from pre-war survey experiments would have
suggested. The divergence in findings is demonstrated by providing
evidence of three empirical phenomena: a ``Rally `Round the Flag{''}
effect, a ``Fog of War{''} effect, and systematic differences in
evaluations of leader performance depending on respondents' proximity to
actual violence.

N2  - Introduction: Web-based surveys save time and money. As electronic
questionnaires have increased in popularity, telephone and mailed
surveys have declined. With any survey, a response rate of 75% or
greater is critical for the validity of any study. We wanted to
determine which survey method achieved the highest response among
academic plastic surgeons.
Methods: All American Association of Plastic Surgeons members were
surveyed regarding authorship issues. They were randomly assigned to
receive the questionnaire through 1 of 4 methods: (A) emailed with a
link to an online survey; (B) regular mail; (C) regular mail + $1 bill,
and (D) regular mail + $5 bill. Two weeks after the initial mailing,
the number of responses was collected, and nonresponders were contacted
to remind them to participate. The study was closed after 10 weeks.
Survey costs were calculated based on the actual cost of sending the
initial survey, including stationary, printing, postage (groups B-D),
labor, and cost of any financial incentives. Cost of reminders to
nonresponders was calculated at $5 per reminder, giving a total survey
cost.
Results: Of 662 surveys sent, 54 were returned because of incorrect
address/email, retirement, or death. Four hundred seventeen of the
remaining 608 surveys were returned and analyzed. The response rate was
lowest in the online group and highest in those mailed with a monetary
incentive.
Conclusions: Despite the convenience and low initial cost of web-based
surveys, this generated the lowest response. We obtained statistically
significant response rates (79% and 84%) only by using postal mail
with monetary incentives and reminders. The inclusion of a $1 bill
represented the greatest value and cost-effective survey method, based
on cost per response

N2  - Neurosurgical training aims at educating future generations of
specialist neurosurgeons and at providing the highest-quality medical
services to patients. Attaining and maintaining these highest standards
constitutes a major responsibility of academic or other training medical
centers.
An electronic survey was sent to European neurosurgical residents
between 06/2014 and 03/2015. Multiple logistic regression analysis was
used to assess the effect size of the relationship between
responder-specific variables (e.g., age, gender, postgraduate year
(PGY), country) and the outcomes (e.g., satisfaction).
A total of 652 responses were collected, of which n = 532 were taken
into consideration. Eighty-five percent were 26-35 years old, 76 %
male, 62 % PGY 4 or higher, and 73.5 % working at a university clinic.
Satisfaction rates with theoretical education such as clinical lectures
(overall: 50.2 %), anatomical lectures (31.2 %), amongst others,
differed largely between the EANS member countries. Likewise,
satisfaction rates with practical aspects of training such as hands-on
surgical experience (overall: 73.9 %), microsurgical training (52.5
%), simulator training (13.4 %), amongst others, were highly
country-dependant. In general, 89.1 % of European residents carried out
the first surgical procedure under supervision within the first year of
training. Supervised lumbar-/cervical spine surgeries were performed by
78.2 and 17.9 % of European residents within 12 and 24 months of
training, respectively, and 54.6 % of European residents operate a
cranial case within the first 36 months of training. Logistic regression
analysis identified countries where residents were much more or much
less likely to operate as primary surgeons compared to the European
average. The caseload of craniotomies per trainee (overall: 30.6 % a
parts per thousand yen10 craniotomies/month) and spinal procedures
(overall: 29.7 % a parts per thousand yen10 spinal surgeries/month)
varied throughout the countries and was significantly associated with
more advanced residency (craniotomy: OR 1.35, 95 % CI 1.18-1.53, p <
0.001; spinal surgery: OR 1.37, 95 % CI 1.20-1.57, p < 0.001).
Theoretical and practical aspects of neurosurgical training are highly
variable throughout European countries, despite some efforts within the
last two decades to harmonize this. Some countries are rated
significantly above (and others significantly below) the current
European average for several analyzed parameters. It is hoped that the
results of this survey should provide the incentive as well as the
opportunity for a critical analysis of the local conditions for all
training centers, but especially those in countries scoring
significantly below the European average.

N2  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper was to evaluate the impact of a
competition-based intervention combining high-resolution electricity
feedback, incentives, information and prompts on college dormitory
residents' energy consumption and participation in demand response
events. The authors also investigated changes in individual-level
pro-environmental behaviors and examined psychosocial correlates of
behavior change.
Design/methodology/approach - Residents of 39 suites in a freshman
residence hall competed against one another to reduce energy consumption
and win prizes as part of a three-week competition. Feedback was
provided in near real-time at the suite-level via an interactive
touch-screen kiosk. Participants also completed baseline and follow-up
surveys.
Findings - Electricity use among all suites was approximately 6.4 per
cent lower during the competition period compared to baseline, a
significant reduction. Additionally, participants reported engaging in
various pro-environmental behaviors significantly more frequently during
the competition relative to baseline. Changes in pro-environmental
behavior were associated with changes in level of group identification
and perceived social norms.
Practical implications - In three weeks, dormitory residents saved 3,158
kWh of electricity compared to baseline - the equivalent of more than
3,470 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions. The findings provide evidence
that real-time feedback, combined with incentives, information and
prompts, can motivate on-campus residents to reduce energy consumption.
Originality/value - The authors contribute to a limited body of evidence
supporting the effectiveness of dorm energy competitions in motivating
college students to save energy. In addition, the authors identified
individual-level behavioral and psychosocial changes made during such an
intervention. University residential life planners may also use the
results of this research to inform student programming.

N2  - A study on the private sector and disaster risk reduction (DRR) was
conducted in six cities of the Americas: Bogota (Colombia), Miami,
Florida (United States), San Jose (Costa Rica), Santiago (Chile),
Kingston (Jamaica), and Vancouver (Canada). The study was led by FIU and
supported by USAID/OFDA and the UNISDR, with collaboration from
researchers of INCAE Business School (Costa Rica), the University of
Chile, Ohio University, and York University (Canada). Based on responses
to nearly 1200 surveys, the key findings indicated that (1) 56% of
respondents do not have a business continuity plan (BCP) in place; (2)
36.5% of businesses considered a BCP desirable, but stated that other
priorities take precedence; (3) the lack of protection in the private
sector is caused by not only financial constraints, but also the still
not well-understood problems of avoidance, the competing priorities
excuse, narrow decision making, and concerns about accountability; (4)
small businesses show the least progress in establishing BCPs (14%)
compared to larger businesses (44.9%); (5) there are insufficient
incentives for DRR strategies to have practical impacts on business
vulnerabilities and lack of resilience; (6) the implementation of
regulations and enforcement mechanisms are weak to non-existent; and (7)
little progress has been made in social responsibility and a sustained
commitment to reducing the vulnerabilities of populations at risk. The
current study offers recommendations to deepen the analysis, better
understand the factors that intervene in the observed ``risk
indifference,{''} and identify possible interventions in order to move
away from the status quo. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - As researchers increasingly use mail survey methods to collect health
and other data, research focused on optimizing features of survey design
and administration in cost-effective ways is needed. We conducted two
studies to examine the effects of sequential prepaid incentives and
envelope messaging on response rates, item nonresponse, and costs in two
mail surveys using address-based samples. Sample members in study 1 were
randomly assigned to groups that received a preincentive of $2 versus
$5, a second incentive of $0 versus $2 (sent only to nonresponders),
and an envelope bearing no message or a monetary-focused message.
Results indicated that the $5 preincentive significantly increased
response rates, but neither the second incentive nor the message had an
effect. Informed by the results of study 1, study 2 delivered a $2
preincentive to all sample members, but increased the amount of the
second incentive to $5. Study 2 also tested a health-focused envelope
message. While envelope messaging again failed to motivate
participation, the administration of a second incentive, valued at a
larger amount than the preincentive, significantly increased response
rates. With regard to their effects on item nonresponse, while none of
the variables was associated with item-missing levels in study 2, a
significant three-way interaction was found in study 1 such that missing
data was higher in the presence of a monetary message when a $2
preincentive was paired with a $2 second incentive. Cost analyses
indicated that while larger incentives increased response rates, they
also increased costs.

N2  - We evaluate incentives for residential energy upgrades in Italy using
data from an original survey of Italian homeowners. In this paper,
attention is restricted to heating system replacements, and to the
effect of monetary and non-monetary incentives on the propensity to
replace the heating equipment with a more efficient one. To get around
adverse selection and free riding issues, we ask stated preference
questions to those who weren't planning energy efficiency upgrades any
time soon. We argue that these persons are not affected by these
behaviors. We use their responses to fit an energy-efficiency
renovations curve that predicts the share of the population that will
undertake these improvements for any given incentive level. This curve
is used to estimate the CO2 emissions saved and their
cost-effectiveness. Respondents are more likely to agree to a
replacement when the savings on the energy bills are larger and
experienced over a longer horizon, and when rebates are offered to them.
Reminding the respondents about possible CO2 emissions reductions (our
non-monetary incentive) had little effect. Even under optimistic
assumptions, monetary incentives similar to those in the Italian tax
credit program are generally not cost-effective.

The purpose of this study is to: (1) assess implementation of
evidence-based programs and policies (EBPPs) related to diabetes
prevention and control in local health departments, (2) assess
feasibility of non-implemented diabetes prevention and control EBPPs,
and (3) examine individual- and organizational-level factors associated
with implementation of diabetes prevention and control EBPPs.
Methods
An online survey was administered in January 2015 to key representatives
of all local health departments in Missouri. Descriptive statistics were
used to describe implementation and perceived feasibility of 20 diabetes
prevention and control EBPPs. Logistic regression was used to examine
the association between individual and organizational factors and
diabetes prevention and control EBPP implementation.
Results
One hundred local health departments participated (89% response rate)
in the online survey. Most frequently implemented diabetes-related EBPPs
in local health departments included: nutrition education for agency or
community members, increased fruit and vegetable access in community
settings, and community-wide campaigns to promote physical activity.
Increased encouragement to others in the department to use
evidence-based decision making and agency incentives to help employees
use evidence-based decision making were positively associated with
implementation of diabetes prevention and control EBPPs.
Conclusions
Local health departments are on the ``front line{''} of public health,
and this study demonstrates the important role these organizations play
in implementing diabetes prevention and control EBPPs. Potential
leverage points for more widespread adoption of diabetes-related EBPPs
in local health departments include education about and encouragement of
evidence-based decision making and organizational incentives for
employees to integrate evidence-based decision making into their
diabetes prevention and control activities.

N2  - This paper presents an empirical study of endogenous treatment effects
in the presence of heterogeneous responses. We estimate the incentive
and selection effects of having prescription drug coverage on total drug
expenditures using a sample from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey
(MCBS). A Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) model is used to model the
heterogeneity in treatment effects. Rather than estimating a finite
mixture model with a fixed number of components, we specify a DP prior
on the parameters, thus allowing the data and prior knowledge to
determine the number of components. Endogeneity is modeled by the
covariance of the error terms of the selection and the outcome equations
in a two-equation selection model. We find that there are strong
incentive and advantageous selection effects, with the average treatment
effect and the average treatment effect for the treated estimated at
$1132 and $858, respectively. Substantial heterogeneity is found to
exist in the selection effects, particularly for those having lower drug
expenditures. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Purpose: There is a lack of information regarding clinical practice
models and faculty compensation plans used by dental school-based
departments of oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMS) and their
effectiveness. The purpose of this study was to examine 1) the level of
uniformity in clinical practice models and faculty compensation plans
for US dental school-based OMS departments and 2) the level of
satisfaction expressed by faculty with their current compensation plan.
Materials and Methods: A survey was sent to the chairs of the 40 US
dental school-based OMS departments asking them specific information
regarding their current practice model, the faculty compensation plan,
and their satisfaction with their current plan.
Results: Twenty-four of the 40 department chairs returned the survey,
for a 60% response rate. The OMS practice was part of the dental school
faculty practice in 50% of the departments and a separate entity in
33%. The most common faculty compensation plan consisted of an academic
salary plus a faculty practice salary based on a collection-based
incentive (38%), but in 25% it was based on production. Fifty-seven
percent of the responding chairs stated they were not satisfied with
their current practice and compensation plans.
Conclusions: There is considerable variation in the practice models and
compensation plans in US dental school-based OMS departments. More than
half the department chairs expressed a general dissatisfaction with
their current compensation plans. The survey data indicate a need for
alternative models, and this report presents one such model. (C) 2015

(sic)7.50, (sic)10.00, and (sic)12.50) on completion of a survey and
interview. Eligible patients (diagnosed type 2 diabetes, over 18 years)
were recruited from primary care practices.
Results: The response rate for the (sic)12.50 incentive was lower
compared with both the (sic)7.50 and the (sic)10.00 incentive {[}odds
ratio (OR) = 0.60 and OR = 0.58]. A nonlinear model yield a better fit
than a linear model. Within the observed range of incentive levels, an
overall decrease in response rate was found.
Conclusion: High monetary incentives are not only inefficient but also
less effective. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. This is

N2  - Objectives: Evaluating unnecessary US medical practices, and the
strategies that reduce them, are increasingly recognized as crucial to
healthcare financing sustainability. Provider factors are known to
affect unnecessary medical practices, yet little is known about how
physician responses to patient requests for unnecessary care affect
these practices. Among primary care physicians (PCPs), we investigated 2
types of unnecessary medical practices triggered by patient requests: a)
unnecessary specialty referrals and b) prescriptions for brand-name
drugs when generic alternatives are available.
Study Design: We used data from a survey of a nationally representative
sample of 840 US PCPs in 2009. Response rates for family practice (n =
274), internal medicine (n = 257), and pediatrics (n = 309) were 67.5%,
60.8%, and 72.7%, respectively.
Results: In response to patient requests, 51.9% of PCPs reported making
unnecessary specialty referrals and 38.7% prescribed brand-name drugs.
Family physicians (odds ratio {[}OR], 2.77; 95% CI, 1.77-4.34) and
internal medicine physicians (OR, 4.51; 95% CI, 2.87-7.06) were more
likely than pediatricians to prescribe brandname drugs. PCP specialty
was similarly associated with unnecessary referrals. Other predictors of
acquiescence to patient requests included interactions with drug/ device
representatives, more years of clinical experience, seeing fewer safety
net patients, and solo/2-person practice organizations. Area-level
Medicare spending was not associated with the 2 unnecessary practices.
Conclusions: Many PCPs reported acquiescing to patient requests for
unnecessary care. Provider and organizational factors predicted this
behavior. Policies aimed at reducing such practice could improve care
quality and lower cost. Patient and physician incentives that can
potentially reduce unnecessary medical practices warrant exploration.

N2  - Privacy and confidentiality are often of great concern to respondents
answering sensitive questions posed by interviewers. Using the 1993-2010
General Social Survey, we examined trends in the provision of social
security numbers (SSNs) and correlates of those responses. Results
indicate that the rate of SSN provision has declined over the past three
decades, that is, from about 60% in 1993-1994 to 20% after 2004.
Although younger, unmarried, and less-educated respondents are more
likely to provide SSNs, an indicator of trust toward others is not a
significant predictor of SSN provision. Further, those who refuse to
report their income and who receive an incentive are less likely to
provide their SSN. Our findings have implications for studies involving
sensitive questions as well as privacy and confidentiality issues.

professional associations have to this day provided incentives for
health IT adoption.
Objective: We aim to assess the proportion of physicians who are
routinely working with electronic health data and describe to what
extent physicians exchange electronic health data with peers and other
health care providers. Additionally, we aim to estimate the effect of
physicians' attitude towards health IT on the adoption of electronic
workflows.
Methods: Between May and July 2013, we conducted a cross-sectional
survey of 1200 practice based physicians in Switzerland. Respondents
were asked to report on their technical means and where applicable their
paper-based workarounds to process laboratory data, examination results,
referral letters and physician's letters. Physicians' view of barriers
and facilitators towards health IT use was determined by a composite
score.
Results: A response rate of 57.1% (n = 685) was reached. The sample was
considered to be representative for physicians in Swiss ambulatory care.
35.2% of the respondents documented patients' health status with the
help of a longitudinal semi-structured electronic text record generated
by one or more encounters in the practice. Depending on the task within
a workflow, around 11-46% of the respondents stated to rely on
electronic workflow practices to process laboratory and examination data
and dispatch referral notes and physician's letters. The permanent use
of electronic workflow processes was infrequent. Instead, respondents
reported paper-based workarounds affecting specific tasks within a
workflow. Physicians' attitude towards health IT was significantly
associated with the adoption of electronic workflows (OR 1.04-1.31, p <
0.05), but the effect sizes of factors related to the working
environment (e.g., regional factors, medical specialty, type of
practice) were larger.
Conclusion: At present, only a few physicians in Swiss ambulatory care
routinely work with electronic health data. Until more of their peers
participate in electronic exchange of structured clinical information,
most physicians will continue to stay in paper-based systems and
workarounds. The survey found that physicians with a positive attitude
towards health IT were more likely to adopt electronic workflows, but
the impact is minor. It will likely be necessary to introduce financial
incentives and develop national standards in order to promote the
adoption by a critical mass of practicing clinicians. (C) 2015 Elsevier

N2  - Background: The effect of timing of incentive payments on the response
rate of telephone surveys is unknown. This study examined whether
up-front or delayed incentive payments were associated with higher
response rates for participation in a telephone interview administered
longitudinal cohort study amongst primary care patients with lower
urinary tract symptoms, and to compare the costs between the two timing
methods.
Methods: This study was conducted as part of a naturalistic observation
study on the health-related quality of life and health outcomes of
Chinese primary care patients with lower urinary tract symptoms. The
incentive payment was in the form of a supermarket gift voucher to the
value of HD$50 (US$6.50) and could be used in lieu of cash at a major
supermarket chain. 720 subjects with lower urinary tract symptoms were
randomly assigned into two groups. One group was offered an incentive of
supermarket cash voucher at time of recruitment ('up-front' payment).
The other group was told that the voucher would be sent to them after
the complete of their 1-year follow-up telephone interview ('delayed'
payment). Primary outcomes were the baseline and 1-year follow-up
telephone survey response rates.
Results: There was no statistical difference in response rates at
baseline (p-value = 0.938) or at the 1-year follow-up (p-value = 0.751)
between groups. Cost per completed subject interviews for the up-front
payment method was USD16.64, whilst cost for the delayed payment was USD
13.85.
Conclusions: It appears the timing of incentive payments does not affect
response rates for telephone interview surveys conducted on primary care
patients in Hong Kong at baseline or at 1-year follow-up. Delayed
incentive payments can reduce the overall cost per successful case.

N2  - Background: Health examination surveys (HESs), carried out in Europe
since the 1950's, provide valuable information about the general
population's health for health monitoring, policy making, and research.
Survey participation rates, important for representativeness, have been
falling. International comparisons are hampered by differing exclusion
criteria and definitions for non-response.
Method: Information was collected about seven national HESs in Europe
conducted in 2007-2012. These surveys can be classified into household
and individual-based surveys, depending on the sampling frames used.
Participation rates of randomly selected adult samples were calculated
for four survey modules using standardised definitions and compared by
sex, age-group, geographical areas within countries, and over time,
where possible.
Results: All surveys covered residents not just citizens; three
countries excluded those in institutions. In two surveys, physical
examinations and blood sample collection were conducted at the
participants' home; the others occurred at examination clinics.
Recruitment processes varied considerably between surveys. Monetary
incentives were used in four surveys. Initial participation rates aged
35-64 were 45 % in the Netherlands (phase II), 54 % in Germany (new
and previous participants combined), 55 % in Italy, and 65 % in
Finland. In Ireland, England and Scotland, household participation rates
were 66 %, 66 % and 63 % respectively. Participation rates were
generally higher in women and increased with age. Almost all
participants attending an examination centre agreed to all modules but
surveys conducted in the participants' home had falling responses to
each stage. Participation rates in most primate cities were
substantially lower than the national average. Age-standardized response
rates to blood pressure measurement among those aged 35-64 in Finland,
Germany and England fell by 0.7-1.5 percentage points p.a. between
1998-2002 and 2010-2012. Longer trends in some countries show a more
marked fall.
Conclusions: The coverage of the general population in these seven
national HESs was good, based on the sampling frames used and the sample
sizes. Pre-notification and reminders were used effectively in those
with highest participation rates. Participation rates varied by age,
sex, geographical area, and survey design. They have fallen in most
countries; the Netherlands data shows that they can be maintained at
higher levels but at much higher cost.

N2  - Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) has been prevalent in Indonesia
since 2003 causing major losses to poultry production and human deaths.
Live bird markets are considered high risk areas due to the density of
large numbers of mixed poultry species of unknown disease status.
Understanding trader knowledge and perceptions of HPAI and biosecurity
is critical to reducing transmission risk and controlling the disease.
An interview-administered survey was conducted at 17 live bird markets
on the islands of Bali and Lombok in 2008 and 2009. A total of 413 live
poultry traders were interviewed. Respondents were mostly male (89%)
with a mean age of 45 years (range: 19-81). The main source of AI
information was TV (78%), although personal communication was also
identified to be an important source, particularly among female traders
(60%) and respondents from Bali (43%). More than half (58%) of live
poultry traders interviewed knew that infected birds can transmit HPAI
viruses but were generally unaware that viruses can be introduced to
markets by fomites. Cleaning cages and disposing of sick and dead birds
were recognized as the most important steps to prevent the spread of
disease by respondents. Two thirds (n = 277) of respondents were
unwilling to report sudden or suspicious bird deaths to authorities.
Bali vendors perceive biosecurity to be of higher importance than Lombok
vendors and are more willing to improve biosecurity within markets than
traders in Lombok. Collectors and traders selling large numbers (>214)
of poultry, or selling both chickens and ducks, have better knowledge of
HPAI transmission and prevention than vendors or traders selling smaller
quantities or only one species of poultry. Education was strongly
associated with better knowledge but did not influence positive
reporting behavior. Our study reveals that most live poultry traders
have limited knowledge of HPAI transmission and prevention and are
generally reluctant to report bird deaths. Greater efforts are needed to
engage local government, market managers and traders in education and
awareness programs, regulatory measures and incentive mechanisms.
Understanding and evaluating the social responses to such an integrated
approach could lead to more effective HPAI prevention and control.

N2  - The use of systems of rewards and sanctions within behaviour policies
has now been adopted formally in UK schools. Such systems potentially
represent competing theoretical ideas when considered alongside current
approaches to teaching and learning. There is also opportunity for
inconsistent use of rewards and sanctions resulting from the absence of
a distinction between incentives and punishments and again between
pupils' task-based work and their social behaviour. This case study
comprises one of three questionnaire surveys completed by UK secondary
school pupils in Year 7 and Year 11. The findings show a complex range
of pupil responses to different behaviour management strategies, as well
as highlighting changes in pupil responses across the age groups. Some
sanctions for classroom behaviour are also found to lead pupils to stay
quiet, potentially affecting their ability to engage in all learning
activities. Sanctions such as asking pupils to miss break, or giving
detentions, are seen to be counter-productive in encouraging pupils to
work hard in class. Some rewards, such as the giving of ``stamps{''}
work well in relation to how much pupils like the teacher, but they are
not found to promote hard work in older pupils. The incentive of the
school reward trip is universally effective, as is contact with home.
These findings offer insight into the ways in which pupils respond to
rewards and sanctions and therefore contribute to our understanding of
how such systems might best be used.

N2  - Background: Patient satisfaction survey scores are increasingly being
tied to incentive compensation, impact how we practice medicine,
influence decisions on where patients seek care, and in the future may
be required for accreditation. The goal of this study is to compare the
results of an internal distribution of patient satisfaction surveys at
the point of care to responses received by mail in a hospital-based,
high-volume pediatric orthopaedic practice.
Methods: A pediatric outpatient survey is used at our institution to
evaluate patient satisfaction. Surveys are randomly mailed out to
families seen in our clinic by the survey vendor, and the results are
determined on a quarterly basis. We distributed the same survey in a
similar manner in our clinic. The results of the surveys,
external/mailed (EXM) versus internal/point of care (INP) over the same
3-month time period (second quarter 2013) were compared. The survey
questions are dichotomized from an ordinal scale into either excellent
(9 to 10) or not excellent (0 to 8) commonly used in patient
satisfaction methodology. We evaluated the raw data from the INP surveys
for the question on provider rating by evaluating the mean score, the
standard excellent response (9 to 10), and an expanded excellent
response (8 to 10).
Results: Response rate was 72/469 (15.4%) for EXM, and 231/333 (69.4%)
for INP. An excellent response for the ``rating your provider{''}
question was 72.2% (EXM) versus 84.8% (INP) (P= 0.015). Our analysis
of the raw data (INP) has a mean rating of 9.42. The expanded scale (8
to 10) for an excellent response increased the provider rating to 94.4%
(P= 0.001). Waiting time response within 15 minutes was the only item
that correlated with rating of provider (P= 0.02). For the majority of
the items, the INP responses were consistently higher than the EXM
responses, including 6/7 responses that were statistically significant
(P< 0.05).
Conclusions: As mandated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services, patient satisfaction surveys will be important in determining
health care outcomes. Properly designed and administered surveys provide
robust measures of quality. Our study reinforces methodological concerns
about patient satisfaction surveys distributed in a high-volume
pediatric subspecialty practice. Further research is needed to evaluate
the patients' health care experience and true quality of care in
pediatric subspecialty ambulatory settings.

raising the financial incentive to claim and reducing claiming barriers.
Older people's response to both is evaluated exploiting the introduction
of Pension Credit in the UK. The reform involved improved application
assistance, simplified claiming procedure, extended recertification
interval, less intrusive reporting requirements and outreach
campaigning; also, the cash entitlement was increased for a subgroup of
pensioners. The behavioral response is identified using Family Resources
Survey data. Results support the effectiveness of financial incentives,
while no effect is found in the case of reducing barriers policies when

N2  - Background: The use of electronic learning formats (e-learning) in
medical education is reported mainly from individual specialty
perspectives. In this study, we analyzed the implementation level of
e-learning formats and the institutional support structures and
strategies at an institutional level in a cluster of mid-European
medical schools.
Methods: A 49-item online questionnaire was send to 48 medical schools
in Austria, Germany and Switzerland using SurveyMonkey (R). Data were
collected between February and September of 2013 and analyzed using
quantities, statistical and qualitative means.
Results: The response rate was 71 %. All schools had implemented
e-learning, but mainly as an optional supplement to the curriculum.
E-learning involved a wide range of formats across all disciplines.
Online learning platforms were used by 97 % of the schools. Full-time
e-learning staff was employed by 50 %, and these had a positive and
significant effect on the presence of e-learning in the corresponding
medical schools. In addition, 81 % offered training programs and
qualifications for their teachers and 76 % awarded performance-oriented
benefits, with 17 % giving these for e-learning tasks. Realization of
e-learning offers was rewarded by 33 %, with 27 % recognizing this as
part of the teaching load. 97 % would use curriculum-compatible
e-learning tools produced by other faculties.
Conclusions: While all participating medical schools used e-learning
concepts, this survey revealed also a reasonable support by
institutional infrastructure and the importance of staff for the
implementation level of e-learning offerings. However, data showed some
potential for increasing tangible incentives to motivate teachers to
engage in further use of e-learning. Furthermore, the use of individual
tools and the distribution of e-learning presentations in various
disciplines were quite inhomogeneous. The willingness of the medical
schools to cooperate should be capitalized for the future, especially
concerning the provision of e-learning tools and concepts.

N2  - We study how taxation influences labour supply using a specifically
designed representative survey of the German population. First, we
investigate whether taxes generally matter for the labour supply
decisions of our respondents. Around 41 per cent report taking taxes
into consideration, implying that the majority of the German population
is unresponsive to taxation. Second, we look at self-reported labour
supply adjustments following a recently enacted payroll tax change. Only
around 12 per cent of our respondents report an actual labour supply
response, but we find evidence of an income, as well as a substitution,
effect of the tax change. Our conclusion is that the effects of taxes on
labour supply in Germany are likely small. We analyse the correlation
with economic and socio-demographic variables and find that the
self-employed are relatively more sensitive to taxation and that low
interest rates reduce incentives for expanding the labour supply. (C)

N2  - Firms are increasingly looking to eradicate social and environmental
non-compliances at their suppliers in response to increasing
regulations, consumer demand, potential for supply chain disruptions,
and to improve their social, environmental, and economic supply chain
performance. This study develops a model of the relationship between the
buyer's supplier incentives and penalties for the supplier's social and
environmental compliance, and the outcomes in terms of reduction in
supplier social and environmental violations as well as the buyer's own
operating costs. This model is tested empirically through analysis of a
dataset of opinion-based survey responses from practitioners at 334
companies across 17 industries. The analysis finds specific penalties
and incentives that are positively associated with reduced supplier
violations and reduced buyer operating costs. In particular, offering
suppliers incentives of increased business and training for improving
social and environmental performance is strongly associated with a
reduction in both violations and operating costs.

N2  - Pension reforms in many developed countries make individuals shoulder a
bigger share of longevity and income risks. The desired response is that
individuals accumulate private assets for retirement. Whether this
actually takes place, is of paramount relevance for scientists and
policy makers. We take Germany as an example: Twenty years of pension
reform have transformed the monolithic German pension system into a
multipillar system. Formerly generous public pension benefits are
gradually being reduced, whereas substantial incentives are granted to
occupational and private saving schemes. Has this transition worked out?
We survey the reform steps and households' reactions: How did
individuals adjust their labor market behavior? How did private and
occupational pension plans take off? How do behavioral adjustments vary
in the population? Most Germans adapted to the new situation. Both
actual and expected retirement decisions changed and the share of
households without supplementary pensions decreased from 73% to 39% in
little more than a decade. This is a remarkable success. Nonetheless,
households with low education, low income and less financial education
did neither adjust their retirement behavior nor pick up supplementary
pension plans and are thus likely to face difficulties in bridging the
gap arising in future pension income.

N2  - Human beings have used fire as an ecosystem management tool for
thousands of years. In the context of the scientific and policy debate
surrounding potential climate change adaptation and mitigation
strategies, the importance of the impact of relatively recent state
fire-exclusion policies on fire regimes has been debated. To provide
empirical evidence to this ongoing debate we examine the impacts of
state fire-exclusion policies in the chestnut forest ecosystems of two
geographically neighbouring municipalities in central Spain, Casillas
and Rozas de Puerto Real. Extending the concept of `Traditional
Ecological Knowledge' to include the use of fire as a management tool as
`Traditional Fire Knowledge' (TFK), we take a mixed-methods and
interdisciplinary approach to argue that currently observed differences
between the municipalities are useful for considering the
characteristics of ``pre-industrial anthropogenic fire regimes{''} and
their impact on chestnut forest ecosystems. We do this by examining how
responses from interviews and questionnaire surveys of local inhabitants
about TFK in the past and present correspond to the current biophysical
landscape state and recent fire activity (based on data from
dendrochronological analysis, aerial photography and official fire
statistics). We then discuss the broader implications of TFK decline for
future fire management policies across Europe particularly in light of
the published results of the EU sponsored Fire Paradox research project.
In locations where TFK-based ``pre-industrial anthropogenic fire
regimes{''} still exist, ecosystem management strategies for adaptation
and mitigation to climate change could be conceivably implemented at a
minimal economic and political cost to the state by local communities
that have both the TFK and the adequate social, economic and cultural
incentives to use it. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Sustainable development in small island developing countries often
hinges upon the successful adoption and diffusion of energy technologies
developed abroad. To guide investments and policies seeking to promote
new energy efficiency technologies academic and marketing studies often
rely upon consumer self-reports of willingness to pay (WTP) for the
environmental and economic benefits such technologies may provide. But
marketing research has long reported disparities between consumer
self-reports of willingness to pay and the actual amounts consumers will
pay when making a purchase decision. This study uses the results of a
survey and associated coupon distribution in Saint Lucia to contrast
self-reported willingness to pay for energy-efficient compact
fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) with actual consumer behavior in a
developing country context. Survey responses suggested that more than
94% of urban consumers in Saint Lucia were willing to pay some price
premium for a high quality CFL bulb. However, when given a coupon
allowing them to purchase a CFL bulb at a price equal to or below their
self-reported willingness to pay, only one-third of the consumers
actually purchased the product. High income respondents, low income
respondents, and younger respondents were among those most likely to not
purchase a CFL bulb when offered the chance to do so at or below their
self-reported willingness to pay. The presence of systematic
discrepancies between self-reported willingness to pay and observed
consumer behavior in CFL markets has important implications for energy
efficiency market research, coupon-based incentive programs and energy
policy in Saint Lucia and other developing nations. (C) 2015

N2  - Background: Equitable access to health care is a goal subscribed to in
many European economies. But while a growing body of literature studies
socioeconomic inequalities in health service use, relatively little is
still known about inequalities in medicine consumption. Against this
background, this study investigates the (socioeconomic) determinants of
medicine use in the Austrian context. Methods: Multivariate logistic
regressions were estimated based on the European Health Interview
Survey, including representative information of the Austrian population
above age 25 (n = 13 291) for 2006/2007. As dependent variables, we used
prescribed and non-prescribed medicine consumption as well as prescribed
polypharmacy. Socioeconomic status was operationalized by employment
status, education and net equivalent income. Health indicators
(self-assessed health, chronic conditions), demographic characteristics
(age, sex) and outpatient visits were included as control variables.
Results: Socioeconomic status revealed opposing utilization patterns:
while individuals with higher education and income were more likely to
consume non-prescribed medicines, the less educated were more likely to
take prescribed medicines. Lower socioeconomic groups also showed a
higher likelihood for prescribed polypharmacy. For the consumption of
both medicine types, the main socioeconomic determinant was high income.
In an additional analysis, lower socioeconomic groups were found to more
likely report prescription purposes as the main reason for consulting a
practitioner. Conclusion: These results point to different behavioural
responses to ill health, not least determined by institutional
incentives in the Austrian health care system.

MethodsA cross-sectional telephone survey of a random sample of
Queensland population aged 18 years or older residing in a dwelling unit
in Queensland that could be contacted on a land-based telephone service
was conducted. One person per household was selected according to a
predetermined algorithm to ensure sex and regional balance were
interviewed. The main outcome measures were: ED use, attitudes towards
ED staff and services, and alternative models of care.
ResultsThe final sample included a total of 1256 respondents (response
rate = 40.3%). Twenty-one per cent attended EDs in the preceding 12
months. The decision to attend was made by patients (51%), health and
medical professionals (31%), and others (18%). The main reasons
included perceived severity of the illness (47%), unavailability of
alternative services (26%) and better care (11%). Most respondents
agreed with more flexible care models of service delivery including
incentives for general practitioners (90%), private health insurance
coverage for ED use (89%), and enhanced roles for paramedics and
nurses.
ConclusionsMain reason for attending ED is perceived severity of
illness, followed by lack of alternative care. The majority of both
consumers and the public are in favour of more flexible care models.
However, further research is necessary to detail those alternatives and
to test and validate their effectiveness.

N2  - BACKGROUNDPatient satisfaction has been associated with improved
outcomes and become a focus of reimbursement.
OBJECTIVEEvaluate an intervention to improve patient satisfaction.
DESIGNNonrandomized, pre-post study that took place from 2011 to 2012.
SETTINGLarge tertiary academic medical center.
PARTICIPANTSInternal medicine (IM) resident physicians, non-IM resident
physicians, and adult patients of the resident physicians.
INTERVENTIONIM resident physicians were provided with patient
satisfaction education through a conference, real-time individualized
patient satisfaction score feedback, monthly recognition, and incentives
for high patient-satisfaction scores.
MAIN MEASURESPatient satisfaction on physician-related and overall
satisfaction questions on the HCAHPS survey. We conducted a
difference-in-differences regression analysis comparing IM and non-IM
patient responses, adjusting for differences in patient characteristics.
KEY RESULTSIn our regression analysis, the percentage of patients who
responded positively to all 3 physician-related Hospital Consumer
Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) questions
increased by 8.1% in the IM and 1.5% in the control cohorts (absolute
difference 6.6%, P=0.04). The percentage of patients who would
definitely recommend this hospital to friends and family increased by
7.1% in the IM and 1.5% in the control cohorts (absolute difference
5.6%, P=0.02). The national average for the HCAHPS outcomes studied
improved by no more than 3.1%.
LIMITATIONSThis study was nonrandomized and was conducted at a single
site.
CONCLUSIONTo our knowledge, this is the first intervention associated
with a significant improvement in HCAHPS scores. This may serve as a
model to increase patient satisfaction, hospital revenue, and train
resident physicians. Journal of Hospital Medicine 2015;10:497-502. (c)

N2  - In surveys consumers express preferences for ethical goods. Some authors
claim, however, that survey responses do not translate into actual
costly purchase behavior. To study if ethical consumption and
differentiation occur in an incentive-compatible setting, this paper
implements a design of an incentivized market experiment, which has been
studied in the context of homogenous goods and both theoretically and
experimentally engenders a dynamic of price decrease. This experiment
establishes that ethical differentiation can be an effective strategy
for sellers with ethically motivated buyers; and, although there is an
ethical price premium, it accrues to the charity rather than to the
seller.

N2  - Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation can save water while
maintaining rice yields, but in some countries its adoption by farmers
remains limited. Key knowledge gaps include the effect of AWD on early
vegetative vigor and its relationship with yield; the effects of AWD on
yield and water use efficiency of local cultivars used by smallholder
farmers; and the socio-economic factors influencing current irrigation
scheduling. To address these questions, an on-farm field trial of
dry-season (chaite) rice, comparing two locally important cultivars
(Hardinath-1 and CH-45) under AWD imposed from 1 week after
transplanting to flowering and continuous flooding (CF), was carried out
in Agyauli in the central Terai region of Nepal, and triangulated with
social research methods exploring the rationale for current irrigation
scheduling and perceptions of AWD. Although AWD plots received on
average 57% less irrigation water than CF plots, yields did not
significantly differ between irrigation treatments, indicating that AWD
could considerably enhance crop water use efficiency in this region. In
the earlier flowering, more vigorous CH-45, there were no treatment
differences in any yield component while in the later flowering
Hardinath-1, an 11% decrease in filled grain number was compensated by
a 14% increase in the percentage of effective tillers per hill.
Although leaf elongation rate on the main tiller did not differ between
treatments, tillering and green fraction (a measure of canopy closure)
were significantly higher under AWD. Surveys established that most local
farmers are already using a local adaptation of AWD to modify irrigation
volumes, in some cases in response to a limited and unreliable water
supply. However, farmers have few direct incentives to reduce overall
water use under current water governance, and formal AWD practices are
therefore unlikely to be adopted despite their viability as a
water-saving irrigation technique.

N2  - Cogeneration, also known as combined heat and power, is the simultaneous
generation of electric and thermal energy from the same fuel source.
Some proven benefits of cogeneration are much higher efficiencies than
conventional power generation and its ability to facilitate distributed
energy and lower energy costs. Also, when cogeneration is fueled with
wood biomass, there are additional environmental benefits such as using
a renewable energy source and lower greenhouse gas emissions. However,
only a small number of wood product manufacturers (North American
Industry Classification System codes 321 and 337) have adopted this
technology. In this study, drivers, perceptions, and barriers for
cogeneration were investigated to gain understanding of the reasons for
the low adoption of this technology among wood product manufacturers.
Interviews of experts and companies were conducted to identify and
understand major topics of cogeneration adoption within the industry.
Subsequently, a nonprobability, target survey of nonadopters was carried
out to identify operational characteristics, perceptions about benefits
of cogeneration, and bathers to its implementation. Findings show that
economies of scale and coincidence between thermal and electric loads
are some of the major factors for cogeneration feasibility. Main bathers
identified were the initial investment and complexity, companies'
return-on-investment requirements, utility tariff policies, and
inadequate policies and incentives. Another major finding was a lack of
awareness and knowledge about cogeneration, which presents organizations
that support the forest products industry with an opportunity to provide
education and outreach. However, because of the small sample size (52
responses), generalization of these results to the population of
interest is not feasible.

N2  - This study utilizes an agent-based simulation model to conduct a public
policy simulation of firms' networking and cooperation in innovation.
The simulation game tests the differences in sector responses to
internal and external changes, including cross-sector spillovers, when
applying three different policy strategies to promote cooperation in
innovation. The public policy strategies include clustering to develop
certain industries, incentives to encourage cooperative research and
development (R&D), and spin-off policies to foster entrepreneurship
among R&D personnel. These policies are compared to a `no-policy'
alternative, which serves as a benchmark to verify the gains (or loses)
in the number of firms cooperating and networking. The simulation model
defines firms' behavior according to empirical findings from an analysis
of determinants of the firms' participation in cooperation in innovation
with other organizations using a Korean Innovation Survey. The exercise
indicates possible appropriate policy strategies that can be applied
depending on the target industries. We have applied a few examples and
showed how the results may be interpreted. Agent-based models are found
to have a great potential in decision-support systems for policy makers.

N2  - The population of the Critically Endangered Mariana crow Corvus kubaryi
on the island of Rota, Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands,
has decreased dramatically in recent years. It is unclear to what extent
negative practices by people, such as inappropriate land use or
persecution of crows, have contributed to this decline. We conducted a
public opinion survey to document ongoing practices towards the crows on
Rota, to assess residents' knowledge of and attitudes towards the birds,
and to gauge potential responses to a government-instituted land
incentive programme. Enumerators administered surveys in person during
August 2011. Most of the 573 respondents were native Chamorro residents
(75%) and more than half were landowners (62%). A majority of
respondents (72%) considered environmental issues very important' and
76% knew of the Mariana crow's Critically Endangered status. Fewer
respondents (55%) expressed concern about the bird going extinct. A
number of respondents condoned shooting and chasing crows (17 and 52%,
respectively), suggesting that residents may be harassing the birds.
Chamorro landowners on the island were more likely to have negative
attitudes towards the crows and to know people who persecute the crows
than other island residents. Education was positively correlated with
knowledge and concern about the crow and environmental issues,
suggesting that new educational programmes on Rota may help improve
residents' attitudes towards the species. In addition, we recommend a
revision of current land-use regulations and implementation of a
monetary compensation programme for owners of crow nesting habitat to
improve landowners' attitudes and practices.

N2  - Studies find that renters are more supportive of public spending that is
financed by the property tax than homeowners, a finding commonly
referred to as the ``renter effect.{''} The renter effect suggests that,
all else equal, renters should prefer property taxation over other forms
of taxation. We test that hypothesis using detailed. micro-level survey
data that contains voter responses to two key questions: their
willingness to pay higher property taxes to fund public services and
their willingness to pay higher sales taxes to fund those services.
Using a difference-in-differences estimation strategy, we find first
that renters are approximately 10 to 18 percentage points more likely
than homeowners to favor a property tax increase over a sales tax
increase, a finding consistent with the presence of a renter effect.
However, these results are not driven by the survey responses of
renters. Analysis based on separate regressions for renters and
homeowners reveals that renters are indifferent between a property tax
increase and either a sales tax or state income tax increase, while
homeowners strongly oppose a property tax increase relative to either a
sales tax or state income tax increase. Further, the strong opposition
among homeowners to the property tax is not eroded by including controls
for income and other demographics as might be expected if these
differences were driven by economic incentives. Finally, an examination
of the variation in tax burden created by Proposition 13 in California
shows no evidence that homeowner aversion to the property tax increases
with the homeowner's relative tax burden. These findings of homeowner
aversion to property taxes are consistent with recent work suggesting
that salience matters when voters evaluate taxes, but also suggest that
increased salience does not necessarily lead to more careful
consideration of individual tax burdens. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

N2  - Background: The current state of employment satisfaction in plastic
surgery has not been defined. Similarly, the factors influencing
residents as they search for employment and the role of attending
surgeons as mentors in this process have not been elicited. The authors
aim to elucidate these measures through a survey of attending surgeons
and senior residents.
Methods: A survey was created assessing employment satisfaction and was
distributed to members of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons with
available contact information. Responses were analyzed, with values of p
< 0.05 deemed significant.
Results: A total of 616 plastic surgeons and senior plastic surgery
residents responded. Compared with attending surgeons in private
practice, those in academic practice were more satisfied with their case
mix (p = 0.0005; OR, not significant) and less satisfied with their
incentive structure (p = 0.0001; OR, 0.3155) and payor mix (p = 0.0005;
OR, 0.6156). Employment change occurred in 225 surgeons (39.2 percent)
since beginning practice. Surgeons that changed employment ranked base
salary (p = 0.0031), earning potential (p = 0.0001), and incentive
structure (p = 0.0001) as most important. Those that did not change
employment ranked lifestyle (p = 0.0048), location (p = 0.0001), and
desire to teach (p = 0.0002) as more important. Residents ranked
location (p = 0.0030), desired case mix (p = 0.0131), and desire or lack
of desire to teach residents (p = 0.0329) as more important than
attending surgeons felt they should be, and guaranteed salary (p =
0.0178) and incentive structure (p = 0.0069) as less important.
Conclusions: In an evolving health care environment, plastic surgeons'
employment satisfaction is significantly dependent on a myriad of
factors. Residents and their attending mentors differ significantly in
perceived importance of these factors.

N2  - Cities can be characterized by extensive sealing limiting the supply of
ecosystem services. In Europe, soil sealing is still increasing despite
decreasing population. This paper shows that the management of urban
soil sealing must due to its complex driving forces, impacts,
constraints of its management and different actors be considered as a
wicked problem. By using the method of response-efficiency-assessment
(REA), the strategies ``legal-planning{''}, ``informal-planning{''},
``economic-fiscal{''}, ``co-operative{''} and ``informational{''} are
assessed in their degree of efficiency as being ecologically
sustainable, economically functional, institutionally accepted,
supporting environmental competence and living quality. Responses were
assessed by indicators using a content analysis and survey of urban
actors and residents in Leipzig and Munich (Germany). Main results of
the study show that no single strategy can provide an efficient solution
for reducing soil sealing but rather a mix of clumsy solutions are
necessary promoting: (I) stricter regulations and an increase in
ecological-financial incentives, (2) stronger commitment by urban actors
toward sealing reduction supported by informal-planning responses and
scientific know-how, (3) information addressed to urban residents
supporting self-reflection on impacts of private land consumption and
(4) improved horizontal and regional co-operations taking into account
cities' responsibility for urban and global sustainability. This study
provides a valuable approach on how to puzzle together clumsy solutions
on the example of soil sealing management as a challenge in an urbanized
world. This method can also be used for other current wicked problems
like climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Survey response rates among physicians are declining, and
determining an appropriate level of compensation to motivate
participation poses a major challenge.
Objective: To estimate the effect of permitting intensive care
physicians to select their preferred level of compensation for
completing a short Web-based survey on physician (1) response rate, (2)
survey completion rate, (3) time to response, and (4) time spent
completing the survey.
Methods: A total of 1850 US intensivists from an existing database were
randomized to receive a survey invitation email with or without an
Amazon.com incentive available to the first 100 respondents. The
incentive could be instantly redeemed for an amount chosen by the
respondent, up to a maximum of US $50.
Results: The overall response rate was 35.90% (630/1755). Among the
35.4% (111/314) of eligible participants choosing the incentive, 80.2%
(89/111) selected the maximum value. Among intensivists offered an
incentive, the response was 6.0% higher (95% CI 1.5-10.5, P=.01),
survey completion was marginally greater (807/859, 94.0% vs 892/991,
90.0%; P=.06), and the median number of days to survey response was
shorter (0.8, interquartile range {[}IQR] 0.2-14.4 vs 6.6, IQR 0.3-22.3;
P=.001), with no difference in time spent completing the survey.
Conclusions: Permitting intensive care physicians to determine
compensation level for completing a short Web-based survey modestly
increased response rate and substantially decreased response time
without decreasing the time spent on survey completion.

N2  - Prepaid survey incentives are an attractive tool for attempting to
combat declining response rates. However, researchers have expressed
concern that the use of incentives may bring less motivated respondents
into the sample, reducing response quality. In this paper, we explore
whether a prepaid cash incentive in a telephone survey affected the
prevalence of 11 indicators of response quality by comparing the answers
of respondents who received a $5 incentive with those of respondents
who did not receive one. Significant differences between the incentive
and control groups are observed for only two of these 11 indicators; the
respondents who received the incentive had less item nonresponse but
spent less time per question. We find some evidence that these effects
may be limited to the second half of the questionnaire. We also assess
whether the effect of the incentive varied according to respondent
characteristics, such as age, educational attainment, and household
income, finding minimal evidence that this was the case. Overall, these
findings should be reassuring for researchers considering the use of
prepaid cash incentives.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Among children's hospitals, little is known
about how barriers to electronic health record (EHR) adoption are
related to meaningful use (MU) incentives. We investigated hospital
success with MU incentive payments and determined associations with
hospital-reported challenges and characteristics.
METHODS: A survey administered to 224 Children's Hospital Association
hospitals assessed a variety of potential challenges to achieving
meaningful EHR use (eg, lack of access to capital) and specific MU
criteria that would be challenging to fulfill (eg, implement clinical
decision support rules). These results were combined with data on
hospitals that received MU payments up to March 2014 and information on
hospital characteristics. Associations between anticipated challenges,
children's hospital type, and receipt of MU incentives were evaluated in
bivariate and multivariate analyses.
RESULTS: One hundred thirty-three children hospitals completed the
survey (response rate 59.4%). Thirty-five percent of responding
children's hospitals received MU incentive payments. The most frequently
anticipated hospital challenges included the following: exchange
clinical information with other providers outside your hospital system
(49%), and generate numerator and denominator data for quality
reporting directly from EHR (41%). Freestanding children's hospitals
were more likely to indicate lack of relevance of MU criteria to
pediatric care (odds ratio: 37.6 {[}95% confidence interval:
4.6-309.3]) and more likely to receive MU incentive payments (odds
ratio: 26 {[}95% confidence interval: 5.2-130.6]).
CONCLUSIONS: As of 2014, a minority of children's hospitals have
successfully received MU incentive payments. Freestanding children's
hospitals are more likely to report MU is not relevant to pediatric care
and to succeed with MU incentive payments.

N2  - Objectives: To compare the impact of unconditional and conditional
financial incentives on response rates among Australian general
practitioners invited by mail to participate in an online survey about
cancer care and to investigate possible differential response bias
between incentive groups.
Study Design and Setting: Australian general practitioners were randomly
allocated to unconditional incentive (book voucher mailed with letter of
invitation), conditional incentive (book voucher mailed on completion of
the online survey), or control (no incentive). Nonresponders were asked
to complete a small subset of questions from the online survey.
Results: Among 3,334 eligible general practitioners, significantly
higher response rates were achieved in the unconditional group (167 of
1,101, 15%) compared with the conditional group (118 of 1,111, 11%) (P
= 0.0014), and both were significantly higher than the control group (74
of 1,122, 7%; both P < 0.001). Although more positive opinions about
cancer care were expressed by online responders compared with
nonresponders, there was no evidence that the magnitude of difference
varied by the incentive group. The incremental cost for each additional
1% increase above the control group response rate was substantially
higher for the unconditional incentive group compared with the
conditional incentive group.
Conclusion: Both unconditional and conditional financial incentives
significantly increased response with no evidence of differential
response bias. Although unconditional incentives had the largest effect,
the conditional approach was more cost-effective. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

department awards program.
An anonymous pre award survey collected responses to understand the need
for an awards program in our department. Five awards were celebrated. An
anonymous post award survey collected responses to evaluate the
effectiveness of the program.
A total of 69 % (175/253) of pre award survey responses were collected.
Among those, 100 % (175/175) agreed that employee recognition was
important. 68 % (119/175) felt that performance should be the deciding
criteria for employee recognition. There was a winner in each award
category. Post award survey showed 78 % (102/130) agreed that the award
ceremony incentivized them to increase quality of personal performance.
In summary, we feel that this transparent, objective, and peer-nominated
awards program could serve as an incentivized model for healthcare
providers to elevate the standards of personal performance, which in
turn will benefit the advancement of patient care.

N2  - BACKGROUND A key consideration in designing pay-for-performance programs
is determining what entity the incentive should be awarded to-individual
clinicians or to groups of clinicians working in teams. Some argue that
team-level incentives, in which clinicians who are part of a team
receive the same incentive based on the team's performance, are most
effective; others argue for the efficacy of clinician-level incentives.
This study examines primary care clinicians' perceptions of a team-based
quality incentive awarded at the clinic level.
METHODS This research was conducted with Fairview Health Services, where
40% of the primary care compensation model was based on clinic-level
quality performance. We conducted 48 in-depth interviews to explore
clinicians' perceptions of the clinic-level incentive, as well as an
online survey of 150 clinicians (response rate 56%) to investigate
which entity the clinicians would consider optimal to target for quality
incentives.
RESULTS Clinicians reported the strengths of the clinic-based quality
incentive were quality improvement for the team and less patient
``dumping,{''} or shifting patients with poor outcomes to other
clinicians. The weaknesses were clinicians' lack of control and
colleagues riding the coattails of higher performers. There were mixed
reports on the model's impact on team dynamics. Although clinicians
reported greater interaction with colleagues, some described an increase
in tension. Most clinicians surveyed (73%) believed that there should
be a mix of clinic and individual-level incentives to maintain
collaboration and recognize individual performance.
CONCLUSION The study highlights the important advantages and
disadvantages of using incentives based upon clinic-level performance.
Future research should test whether hybrid incentives that mix group and
individual incentives can maintain some of the best elements of each
design while mitigating the negative impacts.

acceptability of 6 proposed care coordination objectives for stage 3 of
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services electronic health record
incentive program (Meaningful Use) related to referrals, notification of

dashboards.
METHODS We surveyed physician-owned and hospital/health
system-affiliated primary care practices that achieved patient-centered
medical home recognition and participated in the Meaningful Use program,
and community health clinics with patient-centered medical home
recognition (most with certified electronic health record systems). The
response rate was 35.1%. We ascertained whether practices had
implemented proposed objectives and perceptions of their importance. We
analyzed the association of organizational and contextual factors with
self-reported use of health IT to support care coordination activities.
RESULTS Although 78% of the 350 respondents viewed timely notification
of hospital discharges as very important, only 48.7% used health IT
systems to accomplish this task. The activity most frequently supported
by health IT was providing clinical summaries to patients, in 76.6% of
practices; however, merely 47.7% considered this activity very
important. Greater use of health IT to support care coordination
activities was positively associated with the presence of a nonclinician
responsible for care coordination and the practice's capacity for
systematic change.
CONCLUSIONS Even among practices having a strong commitment to the
medical home model, the use of health IT to support care coordination
objectives is not consistent. Health IT capabilities are not currently
aligned with clinicians' priorities. Many practices will need financial
and technical assistance for health IT to enhance care coordination.

N2  - Background: Submission of clinical quality measures (CQMs) data are 1 of
3 major requirements for providers to receive meaningful use (MU)
incentive payments under the 2009 Health Information Technology for
Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act. Some argue that CQMs are the
most important component of MU. Developing an evidence base for how
practices can successfully use electronic health records (EHRs) to
achieve improvement in CQMs is essential and may benefit from the study
of exemplars who have successfully implemented EHRs and demonstrated
high performance on CQMs.
Methods: Conducted in PPRNet, a national primary care practice-based
research network, this study used a multimethod approach combining an
EHR-based CQM performance assessment, a provider survey, and focus
groups among high CQM performers. Practices whose providers had attested
for stage 1 MU were eligible for the study. Performance on 21 CQMs
included in the 2014 MU CQM set and a summary measure was assessed as of
October 1, 2013, through an automated data extract and standard analytic
procedures. A web-based provider survey, conducted in November to
December 2013, assessed provider agreement, staff education, use of EHR
reminders, standing orders, and EHR-based patient education related to
the 21 CQMs. The survey also had more general questions about the
practices' use of EHR functionality and quality improvement (QI)
strategies. Statistical analyses using general linear mixed models
assessed the associations between responses to the survey and CQM
performance, adjusted for several practice covariates. Three focus
groups, held in early 2014, provided an opportunity for clinicians to
provide their perspectives on the validity of the statistical analyses
and to provide context-specific examples from their practice that
supported their assessment.
Results: Seventy-one practices completed the study, and 319 (92.1%) of
their providers completed the survey. There was wide variability in
performance on the 21 CQMs among the practices. Mean performance ranged
from 89.8% for tobacco use screening and counseling to 12.9% for
chlamydia screening. In bivariate analyses, more positive associations
were found between CQM performance and staff education, use of standing
orders, and EHR reminders than for provider agreement or EHR-based
patient education. In multivariate analyses, EHR reminders were most
frequently associated with individual CQM performance; several EHR,
practice QI, and administrative variables were associated with the
summary quality measure.
Conclusions: Purposeful use of EHR functionality coupled with staff
education in a milieu where QI is valued and supported is associated
with higher performance on CQM.

N2  - Although there are a number of social networking services that
specifically target scholars, little has been published about the actual
practices and the usage of these so-called academic social networking
services (ASNSs). To fill this gap, we explore the populations of
academics who engage in social activities using an ASNS; as an indicator
of further engagement, we also determine their various motivations for
joining a group in ASNSs. Using groups and their members in Mendeley as
the platform for our case study, we obtained 146 participant responses
from our online survey about users' common activities, usage habits, and
motivations for joining groups. Our results show that (a) participants
did not engage with social-based features as frequently and actively as
they engaged with research-based features, and (b) users who joined more
groups seemed to have a stronger motivation to increase their
professional visibility and to contribute the research articles that
they had read to the group reading list. Our results generate
interesting insights into Mendeley's user populations, their activities,
and their motivations relative to the social features of Mendeley. We
also argue that further design of ASNSs is needed to take greater
account of disciplinary differences in scholarly communication and to
establish incentive mechanisms for encouraging user participation.

N2  - ObjectiveThe Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) are a vital data
resource for cross-country comparative analyses. This study is part of a
set of analyses assessing the types of providers being used for
reproductive and maternal health care across 57 countries. Here, we
examine some of the challenges encountered using DHS data for this
purpose, present the provider classification we used, and provide
recommendations to enable more detailed and accurate cross-country
comparisons of healthcare provision.
MethodsWe used the most recent DHS surveys between 2000 and 2012; 57
countries had data on family planning and delivery care providers and 47
countries had data on antenatal care. Every possible response option
across the 57 countries was listed and categorised. We then developed a
classification to group provider response options according to two key
dimensions: clinical nature and profit motive.
ResultsWe classified the different types of maternal and reproductive
healthcare providers, and the individuals providing care. Documented
challenges encountered during this process were limitations inherent in
household survey data based on respondents' self-report; conflation of
response options in the questionnaire or at the data processing stage;
category errors of the place vs. professional for delivery; inability to
determine whether care received at home is from the public or private
sector; a large number of negligible response options; inconsistencies
in coding and analysis of data sets; and the use of inconsistent
headings.
ConclusionsTo improve clarity, we recommend addressing issues such as
conflation of response options, data on public vs. private provider,
inconsistent coding and obtaining metadata. More systematic and
standardised collection of data would aid international comparisons of
progress towards improved financial protection, and allow us to better
characterise the incentives and commercial nature of different
providers.

N2  - Background: Survey research in healthcare is an important tool to
collect information about healthcare delivery, service use and overall
issues relating to quality of care. Unfortunately, physicians are often
a group with low survey response rates and little research has looked at
response rates among physician specialists. For these reasons, the
purpose of this project was to explore survey response rates among
physician specialists in a large metropolitan Canadian city.
Methods: As part of a larger project to look at physician payment plans,
an online survey about medical billing practices was distributed to 904
physicians from various medical specialties. The primary method for
physicians to complete the survey was via the Internet using a
well-known and established survey company (www.surveymonkey.com).
Multiple methods were used to encourage survey response such as
individual personalized email invitations, multiple reminders, and a
draw for three gift certificate prizes were used to increase response
rate. Descriptive statistics were used to assess response rates and
reasons for non-response.
Results: Overall survey response rate was 35.0%. Response rates varied
by specialty: Neurology/neurosurgery (46.6%); internal medicine
(42.9%); general surgery (29.6%); pediatrics (29.2%); and psychiatry
(27.1%). Non-respondents listed lack of time/survey burden as the main
reason for not responding to our survey.
Conclusions: Our survey results provide a look into the challenges of
collecting healthcare research where response rates to surveys are often
low. The findings presented here should help researchers in planning
future survey based studies. Findings from this study and others suggest
smaller monetary incentives for each individual may be a more
appropriate way to increase response rates.

N2  - This paper identifies trends within and relationships between the amount
of participation and the quality of contributions in three crowdsourced
surveys. Participants were asked to perform a collective problem solving
task that lacked any explicit incentive: they were instructed not only
to respond to survey questions but also to pose new questions that they
thought might-if responded to by others-predict an outcome variable of
interest to them. While the three surveys had very different outcome
variables, target audiences, methods of advertisement, and lengths of
deployment, we found very similar patterns of collective behavior. In
particular, we found that: the rate at which participants submitted new
survey questions followed a heavy-tailed distribution; the distribution
in the types of questions posed was similar; and many users posed
non-obvious yet predictive questions. By analyzing responses to
questions that contained a built-in range of valid response we found
that less than 0.2% of responses lay outside of those ranges,
indicating that most participants tend to respond honestly to surveys of
this form, even without explicit incentives for honesty. While we did
not find a significant relationship between the quantity of
participation and the quality of contribution for both response
submissions and question submissions, we did find several other more
nuanced participant behavior patterns, which did correlate with
contribution in one of the three surveys. We conclude that there exists
an optimal time for users to pose questions early on in their
participation, but only after they have submitted a few responses to
other questions. This suggests that future crowdsourced surveys may
attract more predictive questions by prompting users to pose new
questions at specific times during their participation and limiting
question submission at non-optimal times.

N2  - With the advent of sustainable building ordinances in the USA and
internationally, contractors are increasingly required to deliver
sustainable projects; however, they have traditionally not been
considered partners in developing the sustainability goals and
objectives for projects. Moreover, as alternative project delivery
methods become more popular, contractors have an opportunity and - in an
increasing number of cases - a requirement, to take a larger role in
sustainability efforts across the building life cycle. Understanding the
contractor's self-perceived role, in addition to their incentives for
participation, in the sustainable construction industry is imperative to
providing insight into their future role within the industry. This paper
presents data from and analysis of a survey of US-based general
contractors. The survey asked general contractors for their opinions and
viewpoints regarding sustainable construction; respondents provided
feedback about corporate profitability, growth forecast and specific
obstacles to sustainable building. The authors present a potential path
from the current state of sustainable construction industry in the USA
to a projected future state (both characterised by the survey
responses). Finally, factors that will affect the transition to the
future state of the sustainable construction industry are discussed.

N2  - Performance of harvesting operations is vital for wood supply chains to
enable delivery of the right product to the right market at the right
price. Consequently, the performance of harvesting contractors has been
the topic of many studies over the years, but few of these have
investigated the critical issue of whether contractor performance is in
alignment with downstream needs. Furthermore, no previous study has
suggested a clear route that forest companies can take to promote
alignment of their employed contractors. This paper presents a framework
specifically designed to help managers measure and foster contractor
alignment within their wood supply chain.
The framework was tested on a large sample of harvesting contractors
operating in Sweden, for which a performance survey and a statistical
procedure was utilized to segment contractors into groups of varying
levels of alignment with their customer company. Results from the test
were then used to suggest to the customer's managers the most viable
blend of four generic alignment approaches for each contractor group:
active sourcing, adapted incentives, active use of power advantage, and
tailored contractor development programmes. If implemented, such a
structured but differentiated approach to contractor alignment should
lead to the most beneficial response from each contractor, and
eventually to improved performance of the wood supply chain.
Consequently, forest companies need to use, and be proficient in the use
of, a variety of approaches to contractor alignment to make the most of
their contractor force. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background Police crash reports have been used to advance motor vehicle
safety research, though their value is limited by their focus on the
crash event rather than outcomes of the crash.
Objective To develop and evaluate the effect of enhanced recruitment
methods, including a monetary incentive, on response rates of drivers
identified on police reports in a national MVC surveillance system.
Methods The National Automotive Sampling System-General Estimates System
(NASS-GES) was used to identify passenger vehicle crashes between 1 July
and 30 October 2012 involving drivers >= 16 years old with at least one
child occupant <= 17 years old. We collected data from the driver via
self-administered hardcopy or interviewer-administered telephone
surveys. Within each survey mode, half the drivers were randomly
assigned to receive a small monetary incentive. Response rates were
calculated overall, and by mode of survey administration and incentive
condition.
Results 495 drivers were eligible, and 127 completed the survey,
yielding an overall response rate of 25.7% (95% CI 21.8% to 29.5%).
The response rate across the two modes was higher for those who received
an incentive than for those who did not (35.6% vs 15.7%, p<0.01). The
highest response rate (45.9%) was for drivers allocated to the
telephone survey who received an incentive.
Conclusions The NASS-GES provides a surveillance system from which cases
of interest can be identified and supplemental data collected via
surveys of drivers identified on police reports. We adapted procedures
commonly used in public health surveillance systems, including monetary
incentives and branded recruitment materials, to improve driver response
rates.

N2  - Conservation development (CD) refers to a set of land development
techniques aimed at minimizing impacts on natural resources. Typically,
homes are clustered and open space is set aside for conservation. The
evidence for the effectiveness of CDs in conserving biodiversity is
mixed, with some studies attributing these results to a lack of
stewardship in conserved areas. The purpose of this research was to ask
landowners and developers to evaluate which conservation practices, as
part of a policy scenario, would be most acceptable. We surveyed
landowners and developers who had created CDs in north-central Colorado;
we solicited their attitudes about native wildlife conservation and
willingness to adopt four conservation practices, given proposed
incentive-based policies. We also conducted semi-structured interviews
with respondents to elaborate on their response to these proposed
incentives, as well as two potential funding mechanisms for managing the
open space for biodiversity (homeowners' association dues and a property
tax). Overall, we found moderate support for the conservation practices,
some interest in two types of incentives (a housing density bonus and
fast-tracking permits), and opposition to the two proposed funding
mechanisms for land stewardship. Our findings suggest that CD developers
in Colorado would be willing to adopt conservation practices, and are
generally supportive of incentive-based policies, but greater
understanding of homeowners' willingness to pay for conservation
features is needed to gain support for a funding mechanism. (C) 2014

N2  - This meta-analysis quantifies the dose-response relationship between
monetary incentives and response rates in household surveys. It updates
and augments the existing meta-analyses on incentives by analyzing the
latest experimental research, focusing specifically on
general-population household surveys, and includes the three major
data-collection modes (mail, telephone, and in-person) under the same
analytic framework. Using hierarchical regression modeling and
literature from the past 21 years, the analysis finds a strong,
nonlinear effect of incentives. Survey mode and incentive delivery
timing (prepaid or promised) also play important roles in the
effectiveness of incentives. Prepaid incentives offered in mail surveys
had the largest per-dollar impact on response. Incentive timing appears
to play an important role in the effectiveness of incentives offered in
telephone surveys but not in-person surveys. Our model estimates a null
effect of promised incentives in mail surveys; however, given the dearth
of experiments testing this type of incentive, we are unable to draw
firm conclusions regarding their effectiveness. Survey burden and survey
year both were negatively correlated with response overall. However,
neither significantly impacted the dose-response relationship. Survey
sponsorship affected neither response rate nor incentive effectiveness.
The development and results of the model are discussed, and
dose-response estimates specific to mode and incentive timing are
presented.

disorders can be detected early by visually inspecting the oral soft
tissues. This study aimed to determine Australian dentists' opinions and
practices regarding oral mucosal screening, referral and oral cancer
prevention.
MethodsNine hundred and ninety-nine randomly selected general dentists
were mailed a questionnaire. The questionnaire queried practitioners'
opinions and perceptions of oral mucosal screening, their referral
practices and their beliefs regarding detection and prevention of oral
cancer.
ResultsA total of n = 640 individuals responded, yielding a response
rate of 70.2%. Most Australian dentists reported to routinely perform
oral mucosal screening. Lack of training, confidence, time and financial
incentives were seen as barriers to performing mucosal screening to at
least some degree by participants in this study. Most dentists manage
referrals for oral mucosal pathology appropriately; however, only about
half believe in following up with referred patients. Only half of
dentists surveyed believed that they could influence a patient to quit
smoking.
ConclusionsAustralian dentists place importance on oral mucosal
screening. Some changes to dental education and training could be made
to further improve confidence and ability of dentists in detecting and
referring oral mucosal pathology.

N2  - This research addresses gender differences in environmental protection
efforts. Recent work indicates that, across a variety of domains, women
are more generous, charitable, and prosocial than men. Despite
above-average levels of these motivators for cooperation, considerable
experimental research points to no difference in cooperation between
genders. What can explain women's lower-than-expected cooperation
levels? Prior research indicates that, compared to men, women are less
trusting and respond to fear incentives in social dilemmas - they are
concerned about being exploited. We test these arguments in the context
of environmental behaviors and argue that lower trust and greater
responses to fear incentives mean that women's cooperation is predicated
on trust. For men, trust does not predict environmental cooperation. The
current research represents the first empirical test of these arguments.
Using data from the General Social Survey we focus on private sphere
behaviors and political participation and predict an interaction between
gender and trust on cooperation. Results support this prediction. (C)

N2  - Background: Performance reporting in primary health care in Canada is
challenging because of the dearth of concise and synthesized
information. The paucity of information occurs, in part, because the
majority of primary health care in Canada is delivered through a
multitude of privately owned small businesses with no mechanism or
incentives to provide information about their performance. The purpose
of this paper is to report the methods used to recruit family physicians
and their patients across 10 provinces to provide self-reported
information about primary care and how this information could be used in
recruitment and data collection for future large scale pan-Canadian and
other cross-country studies.
Methods: Canada participated in an international large scale study-the
QUALICO-PC (Quality and Costs of Primary Care) study. A set of four
surveys, designed to collect in-depth information regarding primary care
activities was collected from: practices, providers, and patients
(experiences and values). Invitations (telephone, electronic or mailed)
were sent to family physicians. Eligible participants were sent a
package of surveys. Provincial teams kept records on the number of:
invitation emails/letters sent, physicians who registered, practices
that were sent surveys, and practices returning completed surveys.
Response and cooperation rates were calculated.
Results: Invitations to participate were sent to approximately 23,000
family physicians across Canada. A total of 792 physicians and 8,332
patients from 772 primary care practices completed the surveys,
including 1,160 participants completing a Patient Values survey and
7,172 participants completing a Patient Experience survey. Overall, the
response rate was very low ranging from 2% (British Columbia) to 21%
(Nova Scotia). However, the participation rate was high, ranging from
72% (Ontario) to 100% (New Brunswick/Prince Edward Island and
Newfoundland & Labrador).
Conclusions: The difficulties obtaining acceptable response rates by
family physicians for survey participation is a universal challenge.
This response rate for the QUALICO-PC arm in Canada was similar to rates
found in other countries such as Australia and New Zealand. Even though
most family physicians operate as self-employed small businesses, they
could be supported to routinely submit data through a collective effort
and provincial mandate. The groundwork in setting up pan-Canadian
collaboration in primary care has been established through this study.

N2  - QUESTIONS UNDER STUDY: The reimbursement system SwissDRG sets incentives
for hospitals and providers to treat patients in a cost-efficient way.
Arising conflicts between the commitment to the patient's well-being and
the economic interests of the hospital can lead to an impairment of
quality and equity of health care. We developed and used a monitoring
tool to evaluate ethically relevant aspects related to DRGs by surveying
physicians.
METHODS: We surveyed a random sample of physicians working in Swiss
hospitals, exploring potentially positive and negative effects of DRGs
on patient care.
RESULTS: A total of 382 physicians completed the questionnaire (response
rate 47%). More than 90% judged quality of health care ``very good{''}
or ``rather good{''}, and 83% were satisfied with their job. The
majority of physicians gave more consideration to economic issues in
their clinical practise than they would have liked and had experienced
various forms of over-and under-provision over the past six months.
Overall, physicians considered patient-orientation deteriorating since
the introduction of DRGs with no gains in efficiency. Professional
principles could not be applied in all instances.
CONCLUSIONS: Two years after the introduction of SwissDRG the quality of
patient care and the job satisfaction is rated as good by most
physicians. However, quality of care could be seriously compromised if
more economic pressure is put on physicians in the future. Careful
monitoring is needed to ensure that the needed focus on cost-containment
and sustainability does not come at the expense of the high performance
of the Swiss health care system.

compared those who completed the survey with those who did not. Also we
explored the influence of different monetary incentives on response
rates. The findings indicated that when evaluating 18 different areas
including background measures, personality measures, family of origin
measures, and couple measures, there were only minor differences between
those with valid and invalid email addresses, and only one difference
between those who completed the survey and those who did not. Also a
lottery type monetary incentive showed promise in improving response
rates compared to no incentive and a standard $20 incentive.

N2  - In recent years, parastatal grain marketing boards have re-emerged as
important elements of grain markets in eastern and southern Africa, yet
little is known about how farmers are responding to their scaled up
activities. This article develops a conceptual model of farmers'
production decisions in the context of dual output marketing channels
(government and private sector) when output prices at harvest time and
the availability of one of the marketing channels are unknown at
planting time. It then applies the model to the case of Zambia and uses
nationally representative household-level panel survey data to estimate
the effects of the Food Reserve Agency (FRA), the government parastatal
maize marketing board, on smallholder crop production and fallow land.
The FRA buys maize from smallholders at a pan-territorial price that
typically exceeds market prices in major maize producing areas. Results
suggest that increases in the farmgate FRA maize price raise farmer
maize price expectations, which induces a supply response. Smallholders
respond to an increase in the FRA price by extensifying their maize
production. On average, a 1% increase in the FRA price is associated
with 0.06% increases in smallholders' maize area planted and quantity
harvested. There is also some evidence that farmers reduce the area of
land under fallow in response to FRA incentives but there is no evidence
of reductions in the area planted to other crops.

N2  - Background: General Practitioners (GPs) respond poorly to postal
surveys. Consequently there is potential for reduced data quality and
bias in the findings. In general population surveys, response to postal
questionnaires may be improved by reducing their length and offering
incentives. The aim of this study was to investigate whether
questionnaire length and/or the offer of an incentive improves the
response of GPs to a postal questionnaire survey.
Methods: A postal questionnaire survey was sent to 800 UK GPs randomly
selected from Binley's database; a database containing contact details
of professionals working in UK general practices. The random sample of
GPs was assigned to one of four groups of 200, each receiving a
different questionnaire, either a standard (eight sides of A4) or an
abbreviated (four sides of A4) questionnaire, with or without the offer
of an incentive (a prize draw entry for a 100 pound voucher) for
completion. The effects of questionnaire length and offer of incentive
on response were calculated.
Results: Of 800 mailed questionnaires, 19 GPs did not meet inclusion
criteria and 172 (adjusted response 22.0%) completed questionnaires
were received. Among the four groups, response ranged from 20.1%
(standard questionnaire with no incentive and abbreviated questionnaire
with incentive) through 21.8% (standard questionnaire with incentive),
to 26.0% (abbreviated questionnaire with no incentive). There were no
significant differences in response between the four groups (p = 0.447),
between the groups receiving the standard versus the abbreviated
questionnaire (% difference -2.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) -7.9,
3.7)) or the groups offered an incentive versus no incentive (%
difference -2.1% (95% CI -7.9, 3.7).
Conclusions: Strategies known to improve response to postal
questionnaire surveys in the general population do not significantly
improve the response to postal questionnaire surveys among GPs. Further
refinements to these strategies, or more novel strategies, aimed at
increasing response specifically among GPs need to be identified in
order to maximise data quality and generalisability of research results.

N2  - Objectives. The participation rate in the Danish National Health Survey
(DNHS) 2010 was significantly lower among ethnic minorities than ethnic
Danes. The purpose was to characterize nonresponse among ethnic
minorities in DNHS, analyze variations in item nonresponse, and
investigate barriers and incentives to participation.
Design. This was a mixed-method study. Logistic regression was used to
analyze nonresponse using data from DNHS (N = 177,639 and chi-square
tests in item nonresponse analyses. We explored barriers and incentives
regarding participation through focus groups and cognitive interviews.
Informants included immigrants and their descendants of both sexes, with
and without higher education.
Results. The highest nonresponse rate was for non-Western descendants
(80.0%) and immigrants 25 (72.3%) with basic education. Immigrants and
descendants had higher odds ratios (OR = 3.07 and OR = 3.35,
respectively) for nonresponse than ethnic Danes when adjusted for sex,
age, marital status, and education. Non-Western immigrants had higher
item nonresponse in several question categories. Barriers to
non-participation related to the content, language, format, and layout
of both the questionnaire and the cover letter. The sender and setting
in which to receive the questionnaire also influenced answering
incentives. We observed differences in barriers and incentives between
immigrants and descendants.
Conclusions. Nonresponse appears related to linguistic and/or
educational limitations, to alienation generated by the questions' focus
on disease and cultural assumptions, or mistrust regarding anonymity.
Ethnic minorities seem particularly affected by such barriers. To
increase survey participation, questions could be sensitized to reflect
multicultural traditions, and the impact of sender and setting
considered.

N2  - This study explores students' perceptions related to the implementation
of e-portfolios in the context of Taiwanese higher education. Thirty
Taiwanese university students were interviewed, and data analysis
includes 14 interviewees' e-portfolios and responses to 281 valid
surveys from non-interviewed students. The study presents students'
perspectives using textual descriptions and visual presentations related
to developing e-portfolios. A three-stage model developed by the first
author links five critical success factors for implementing e-portfolios
in Taiwan. Overall, the students' perceived usefulness, university
support, and e-portfolio audiences (i.e., educators, employers, and
friends) as well as intentions to visit e-portfolios are the major
components used to promote e-portfolios in Taiwanese higher education.
The findings of the study indicate that the value of developing an
e-portfolio can be enhanced by using incentives such as design contests
or encouragement through various other activities (e.g., class
activities, team projects, and extracurricular activities).
Accessibility, interactivity, and ownership are university students'
concerns when they are deciding to develop e-portfolios. For
implementing a system of e-portfolios, the study suggests guidelines
that can become important references for countries with similar cultural
backgrounds in higher education. New insights relevant for scholars from
Western countries also appear at the end.

N2  - Objectives: Physicians are a commonly targeted group in health research
surveys, but their response rates are often relatively low. The goal of
this paper was to evaluate the effect of unconditional incentives in the
form of a coffee card on physician postal survey response rates.
Design: Following 13 key informant interviews and eight cognitive
interviews a survey questionnaire was developed.
Participants: A random sample of 534 physicians, stratified by physician
group (geriatricians, family physicians, emergency physicians) was
selected from a national medical directory.
Setting: Using computer generated random numbers; half of the physicians
in each stratum were allocated to receive a coffee card to a popular
national coffee chain together with the first survey mailout.
Interventions: The intervention was a $10 Tim Hortons gift card given
to half of the physicians who were randomly allocated to receive the
incentive.
Results: 265 (57.0%) physicians completed the survey. The response rate
was significantly higher in the group allocated to receive the incentive
(62.7% vs 51.3% in the control group; p=0.01).
Conclusions: Our results indicate that an unconditional incentive in the
form of a coffee gift card can substantially improve physician response
rates. Future research can look at the effect of varying amounts of cash
on the gift cards on response rates.

N2  - Background: A core measure of the meaningful use of EHR incentive
program is the generation and provision of the clinical summary of the
office visit, or the after visit summary (AVS), to patients. However,
little research has been conducted on physician perceptions and beliefs
about the AVS.
Objective: Evaluate physician perceptions and beliefs about the AVS and
the effect of the AVS on workload, patient outcomes, and the care the
physician delivers.
Methods: A cross-sectional online survey of physicians at two academic
medical centers (AMCs) in the northeast who are participating in the
meaningful use EHR incentive program.
Results: Of the 1 795 physicians at both AMCs participating in the
incentive program, 853 completed the survey for a response rate of
47.5%. Eighty percent of the respondents reported that the AVS was easy
(very easy or quite easy or somewhat easy) to generate and provide to
patients. Nonetheless, more than three-fourths of the respondents
reported a negative effect of generating and providing the AVS on
workload of office staff (78%) and workload of physicians (76%).
Primary care physicians had more positive beliefs about the effect of
the AVS on patient outcomes than specialists (p< 0.001) and also had
more positive beliefs about the effect of the AVS on the care they
delivered than specialists (p< 0.001).
Conclusions: Achieving the core meaningful use measure of generating and
providing the AVS was easy for physicians but it did not necessarily
translate into positive beliefs about the effect of the AVS on patient
outcomes or the care the physician delivered. Physicians also had
negative beliefs about the effect of the AVS on workload. To promote
positive beliefs among physicians around the AVS, organizations should
obtain physician input into the design and implementation of the AVS and
develop strategies to mitigate its negative impacts on workload.

N2  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the contribution
of regulatory incentives offered by regulators as a moderator variable
enhancing adoption of Malaysian food safety system (MeSTI).
Design/methodology/approach - Structural equation modelling (SEM) with
partial least square (PLS) was used to examine the determinants of MeSTI
adoption in food industry.
Findings - Responses to a questionnaire were collected from 89 firms,
and statistical results confirmed that organizational factors (top
management support and perceived technical competent) and scheme factors
(perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use) have significant
influence upon MeSTI adoption. While environment factors (perceived
industry pressure and perceived government pressure) and expected
factors (expected social legitimacy and expected economic
competitiveness) did not have significant impact on MeSTI adoption.
Regulatory incentives the government offered had no moderating effect on
the relationships of the determinants studied.
Practical implications - Although many companies remain unfamiliar or
have limited knowledge of MeSTI, the respondents surveyed herein, which
were small and medium enterprises (SMEs), argued that MeSTI was very
helpful in controlling food safety standards inMalaysia. Government or
non- government regulatory agencies should promote and encourage food
industry compliance with the Malaysian food safety certification.
Governments also need to rethink and redesign current regulatory
incentives offers to the food industry, which often have no direct
impact on the companies' business.
Originality/value - Though many factors potentially could influence the
industry to adopt a food safety scheme, the moderating effect of
regulatory incentives is an interesting area to study in relationship to
its potential effects to adopt food safety standards and practices. In
some extent, this serves as a yardstick for measuring the impact of
voluntary compliance and points to future directions for what should
occur in the future.

N2  - Perpetual conservation easements (CEs) are popular for restricting
development and land use, but their fixed terms create challenges for
adaptation to climate change. The increasing pace of environmental and
social change demands adaptive conservation instruments. To examine the
adaptive potential of CEs, we surveyed 269 CEs and interviewed 73
conservation organization employees. Although only 2% of CEs mentioned
climate change, the majority of employees were concerned about climate
change impacts. CEs share the fixed-boundary limits typical of protected
areas with additional adaptation constraints due to permanent terms on
private lands. CEs often have multiple, potentially conflicting purposes
that protect against termination but complicate decisions about
principled, conservation-oriented adaptation. Monitoring is critical for
shaping adaptive responses, but only 35% of CEs allowed organizations
to conduct ecological monitoring. In addition, CEs provided few
requirements or incentives for active stewardship of private lands. We
found four primary options for changing land use restrictions, each with
advantages and risks: CE amendment, management plan revisions, approval
of changes through discretionary consent, and updating laws or policies
codified in the CE. Conservation organizations, funders, and the
Internal Revenue Service should promote processes for principled
adaptation in CE terms, provide more active stewardship of CE lands, and
consider alternatives to the CE tool.

N2  - Given the increased role of bibliometric measures in research
evaluation, it is striking that studies of actual changes in research
practice are rare. Most studies and comments on `a metric culture' in
academia focus on the ideological and political level, and there is a
clear shortage of empirical studies that analyze how researchers handle
demands for accountability in context. In adopting a mixed-methods
approach involving both bibliometric data and answers form
questionnaires, we provide an in-depth study of how researchers at the
faculty of Arts at Uppsala University (Sweden) respond to the
implementation of performance-based research evaluation systems.
Publication patterns from 2006 to 2013 show that journal publications,
especially English-language ones, are increasing, and the proportion of
peer-reviewed publications has doubled. These changes are in line with
the incentives of the evaluation systems under study. Answers to the
survey confirm that scholars are conscious about this development, and
several respondents articulate a disagreement between disciplinary norms
and external demands. However, disciplinary background as well as career
stage or academic age appears to have a significant influence on how
individual researchers react to the instigation of evaluation systems.
Finally, responses to national and local evaluation regimes are complex,
localized, and dependent on many factors. In-depth contextualized
studies of research practices are needed in order to understand how
performance-based funding systems influence academic research on the
ground.

N2  - The HITECH Act of 2009 enabled the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
Services (CMS) to provide financial incentives to health care providers
who demonstrate ``meaningful use{''} (MU) of their electronic health
records (EHRs). Despite stakeholder involvement in the rule-making
phase, formal input about the MU program from a cross section of
providers has not been reported since incentive payments began.
To examine the perspectives and experiences of a random sample of health
care professionals eligible for financial incentives (eligible
professionals or EPs) for demonstrating meaningful use of their EHRs. It
was hypothesized that EPs actively participating in the MU program would
generally view the purported benefits of MU more positively than EPs not
yet participating in the incentive program.
Survey data were collected by mail from a random sample of EPs in
Washington State and Idaho. Two follow-up mailings were made to
non-respondents.
The sample included EPs who had registered for incentive payments or
attested to MU (MU-Active) and EPs not yet participating in the
incentive program (MU-Inactive).
The survey assessed perceptions of general realities and influences of
MU on health care; views on the influence of MU on clinics; and personal
views about MU. EP opinions were assessed with close- and open-ended
items.
Close-ended responses indicated that MU-Active providers were generally
more positive about the program than MU-Inactive providers. However, the
majority of respondents in both groups felt that MU would not reduce
care disparities or improve the accuracy of patient information. The
additional workload on EPs and their staff was viewed as too great a
burden on productivity relative to the level of reimbursement for
achieving MU goals. The majority of open-ended responses in each group
reinforced the general perception that the MU program diverted attention
from treating patients by imposing greater reporting requirements.
Survey results indicate the need by CMS to step up engagement with EPs
in future planning for the MU program, while also providing support for
achieving MU standards.

provider incentives for smoking cessation and breast feeding as part of
the Benefits of Incentives for Breastfeeding and Smoking cessation in
pregnancy (BIBS) study.
Design: Cross-sectional survey and qualitative interviews.
Setting: Scotland and North West England.
Participants: Early years professionals: 497 survey respondents included
156 doctors; 197 health visitors/maternity staff; 144 other health
staff. Qualitative interviews or focus groups were conducted with 68
pregnant/postnatal women/family members; 32 service providers; 22
experts/decision-makers; 63 conference attendees.
Methods: Early years professionals were surveyed via email about the
acceptability of payments to local health services for reaching smoking
cessation in pregnancy and breastfeeding targets. Agreement was measured
on a 5-point scale using multivariable ordered logit models. A framework
approach was used to analyse free-text survey responses and qualitative
data.
Results: Health professional net agreement for provider incentives for
smoking cessation targets was 52.9% (263/497); net disagreement was
28.6% (142/497). Health visitors/maternity staff were more likely than
doctors to agree: OR 2.35 (95% CI 1.51 to 3.64; p < 0.001). Net
agreement for provider incentives for breastfeeding targets was 44.1%
(219/497) and net disagreement was 38.6% (192/497). Agreement was more
likely for women (compared with men): OR 1.81 (1.09 to 3.00; p = 0.023)
and health visitors/maternity staff (compared with doctors): OR 2.54
(95% CI 1.65 to 3.91; p < 0.001). Key emergent themes were `moral
tensions around acceptability', `need for incentives', `goals',
`collective or divisive action' and `monitoring and proof'. While
provider incentives can focus action and resources, tensions around the
impact on relationships raised concerns. Pressure, burden of proof,
gaming, box-ticking bureaucracies and health inequalities were
counterbalances to potential benefits.
Conclusions: Provider incentives are favoured by non-medical staff.
Solutions which increase trust and collaboration towards shared goals,
without negatively impacting on relationships or increasing bureaucracy
are required.

N2  - Although leasing hunting rights increases landowner income and provides
incentives to improve wildlife habitat, few landowners lease their
lands. In this article, landowner attitudes about potential problems
associated with fee hunting leases were explored based on a mail survey
of nonindustrial private forest (NIPF) landowners. Responses to
questions eliciting landowner levels of concern with 17 potential issues
associated with hunting leases were aggregated into four categories:
concerns about property damage and liability, customer relations,
impacts on personal use, and impacts on habitat, wildlife and safety.
Landowners were grouped into five subgroups based on their attitudes to
these four categories. These groups were significant predictors of
landowner willingness to allow hunting access in conjunction with public
land hunting lease rate, property characteristics, and landowner
demographics. These results provided insights into problems facing
hunters and land managers attempting to improve access to NIPF lands.

for managing wildlife (e.g., compensation schemes). We examined
acceptance of strategies for managing beaver impacts, use of incentives
to protect habitat and retain beavers on private property, and how
responses differed by impact severity, residential location, and
experiences with beavers. Data were obtained from surveys of landowners
in four regions of Oregon (n = 1,204). Education about how to coexist
with beavers was the most acceptable management response across six
impact scenarios (e.g., beaver chews trees, floods buildings). Lethal
control was unacceptable across all scenarios. As impacts increased,
leaving beavers alone became unacceptable and removing dams became
acceptable. Irrespective of impact, landowners would be more likely to
use incentives (e.g., financial compensation) than remove beavers.
Landowners in Eastern Oregon and those who experienced impacts would be
less likely to use incentives and considered aggressive strategies
(e.g., removing dams, lethal control) more acceptable.

N2  - Background: Meaningful Use (MU) provides financial incentives for
electronic health record (EHR) implementation. EHR implementation holds
promise for improving healthcare delivery, but also requires substantial
changes for providers and staff. Establishing readiness for these
changes may be important for realizing potential EHR benefits. Our study
assesses whether provider/staff perceptions about the appropriateness of
MU and their departments' ability to support MU-related changes are
associated with their reported readiness for MU-related changes.
Methods: We surveyed providers and staff representing 47 ambulatory
practices within an integrated delivery system. We assessed whether
respondent's role and practice-setting type (primary versus specialty
care) were associated with reported readiness for MU (i.e., willingness
to change practice behavior and ability to document actions for MU) and
hypothesized predictors of readiness (i.e., perceived appropriateness of
MU and department support for MU). We then assessed associations between
reported readiness and the hypothesized predictors of readiness.
Results: In total, 400 providers/staff responded (response rate
approximately 25%). Individuals working in specialty settings were more
likely to report that MU will divert attention from other patient-care
priorities (12.6% vs. 4.4%, p = 0.019), as compared to those in
primary-care settings. As compared to advanced-practice providers and
nursing staff, physicians were less likely to have strong confidence in
their department's ability to solve MU implementation problems (28.4%
vs. 47.1% vs. 42.6%, p = 0.023) and to report strong willingness to
change their work practices for MU (57.9% vs. 83.3% vs. 82.0%, p <
0.001). Finally, provider/staff perceptions about whether MU aligns with
departmental goals (OR = 3.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.13 to
7.48); MU will divert attention from other patient-care priorities (OR =
2.26, 95% CI = 1.26 to 4.06); their department will support MU-related
change efforts (OR = 3.99, 95% CI = 2.13 to 7.48); and their department
will be able to solve MU implementation problems (OR = 2.26, 95% CI =
1.26 to 4.06) were associated with their willingness to change practice
behavior for MU.
Conclusions: Organizational leaders should gauge provider/staff
perceptions about appropriateness and management support of MU-related
change, as these perceptions might be related to subsequent
implementation.

practitioners `time constraints, the low prioritization of elderly
patients with depression, and the patients' or relatives `wish for
medication. Approximately three-quarters of the determinants were from
three of the seven domains in the generic checklist: individual
healthcare professional factors, patient factors, and incentives and
resources. The survey did not provide useful information due to a low
response rate and a lack of responses to open-ended questions.
Implications. The list of prioritized determinants can inform the design
of interventions to implement recommendations for elderly patients with
depression. The importance of the determinants that were identified may
vary across communities, practices. and patients. Interventions that
address important determinants are necessary to improve practice.

N2  - BackgroundThe Shorter Stays in Emergency Departments health target was
introduced in New Zealand in 2009. District Health Boards (DHBs) are
expected to meet the target with no additional funding or incentives.
The costs of implementing such targets have not previously been studied.
MethodA survey of clinical/service managers in ED throughout New Zealand
determined the type and cost of resources used for the target. Responses
to the target were classified according to their impact in ED, the
hospital and the community. Quantifiable resource changes were assigned
a financial value and grouped into categories: structure
(facilities/beds), staff and processes. Simple statistics were used to
describe the data, and the correlation between expenditure and target
performance was determined.
ResultsThere was 100% response to the survey. Most DHBs reported some
expenditure specifically on the target, with estimated total expenditure
of over NZ$52m. The majority of expenditure occurred in ED (60.8%) and
hospital (38.7%) with little spent in the community. New staff
accounted for 76.5% of expenditure. Per capita expenditure in the ED
was associated with improved target performance (r = 0.48, P = 0.03),
whereas expenditure in the hospital was not (r = 0.08, P = 0.75).
ConclusionThe fact that estimated expenditure on the target was over
$50 million without additional funding suggests that DHBs were able to
make savings through improved efficiencies and/or that funds were
reallocated from other services. The majority of expenditure occurred in
the ED. Most of the funds were spent on staff, and this was associated
with improved target performance.

N2  - Internationalization and technological developments have changed the
work organization in developed and developing industrial economies.
Information and communication technologies, such as computers and
smartphones, are increasingly used, allowing more temporal and spatial
flexibility of work. This may lead to an increase in supplemental work,
i.e. constant availability or working in addition to contractually
agreed work hours. This in turn extends work hours and leads to work
hours in evenings and weekends, causing interferences of work hours with
biological and social rhythms for sleep, recovery and social
interaction. However, empirical findings on the effects of supplemental
work and work hours on occupational health are rather scarce. Therefore,
the aim of this study was to investigate the association between (1)
work-related contacts outside of regular work hours and (2) working in
the free time with self-reported work-related health impairments in the
fourth and fifth European Working Conditions Surveys (EWCS 2005, EWCS
2010). Out of these cross-sectional, large-scale surveys, data on n = 22
836 and n = 34 399 employed workers were used for weighted logistic
regression analyses. About half of the sample reported at least
occasional supplemental work. The results showed an increased risk of
reporting at least one health problem for employees who had been
contacted by their employer (EWCS 2005), or worked in their free time to
meet work demands (EWCS 2010) in the last 12 months, compared to those
reporting no supplemental work or work-related contacts during free
time. These results were controlled for demographic variables, physical
and mental work load, worker autonomy, and several work hours
characteristics (e.g. hours per week, unusual and variable hours). The
risk of reporting health problems was increased by being contacted both
sometimes (Odds Ratio {[}OR] 1.26, 95% Confidence Interval {[}CI]
1.14-1.39) and often (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.02-1.25), whereas the frequency
of working in the free time showed a clear dose-response effect
(sometimes: OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.04-1.24; often: OR 1.60, 95% CI
1.47-1.75), both compared to the category ``never{''}. The findings,
thus, indicate that even a small amount of supplemental work beyond
contractually agreed work hours may increase the risk of work-related
health impairments. Working in the free time was associated with a
substantial risk increase and might be a better indicator for actual
work load than being contacted by the employer outside of contractually
agreed work hours. Thus, in order to minimize negative health effects,
availability requirements for employees outside their regular work hours
should be minimized. While these effects definitely need further study,
especially regarding a quantification of actual supplemental work and
its temporal location, addressing the company culture and using
incentives and policies might be options to reduce the amount of
supplemental work and maintain the risks of health impairments in the
working population at a lower level.

N2  - Purpose Despite the growing importance of cancer and return-to-work
issues in occupational rehabilitation literature in the last decade,
academic discussion is largely limited to survivors' perspectives and
some exploratory studies from the employer side. This paper applies two
classic theoretical models-Theory of Planned Behavior and Social
Cognitive Theory-and key measures from previous studies to identify
explicit relationships that explain employer factors to hire and retain
cancer survivors. Methods Data were collected from online surveys with
senior management executives and senior human resource specialists from
various organizations in Singapore, with a total of 145 responses. The
72-item survey instrument included a series of independent variables:
(1) Attitudes toward cancer and cancer survivors; (2) Employers'
efficacy; (3) Perceived moral obligation; (4) Employers' experience; (5)
Outcome expectations; (6) Employment situation; (7) Social norms; and
(8) Incentives, and dependent variables: (a) Employers' intention to
hire cancer survivors; and (b) Employers' intention to retain cancer
survivors. Results Regression analyses showed that the top three factors
related to employers' intention to retain cancer survivors are perceived
moral obligations (beta = .39, p < .001), followed by attitudes toward
cancer (beta = .25, p < .01), and employment situation (beta = .17, p <
.05). Employers' efficacy was associated with intention to hire (beta =
.22, p < .05), coupled with attitude toward cancer survivors (beta =
.22, p < .01). The findings also indicated the important role of
existing relationship between an employer and an employee when it comes
to retaining cancer survivors and government incentives for hiring
cancer survivors in the workforce. Conclusions The present study
provided an avenue to implement the proposed model-a potential study
framework for the management of cancer survivors at work. Findings
revealed that different messages should be tailored to employers toward
hiring and retention issues and provided useful guidelines for employer
education materials.

This one is interesting because it says that: &quot;Regarding large-scale panel surveys, we could not unequivocally confirm that incentives increased response rates in later panel waves.&quot; 

And this is what they looked at the NEPS in 2009: In the pilot study of NEPS wave 1 in 2009 (Infas 2009), the incentive amount varied experimentally. The gross sample of the pilot study was split randomly into two groups. The experimental group (N = 861) received €10, conditional on participation, whereas the control group (N = 908) received no incentive. At the end of the field period after only four weeks, only 190 interviews were realized; thus, the response rate was low overall.
N2  - Background: The In-Center Hemodialysis Consumer Assessment of Healthcare
Providers and Systems (ICH CAHPS) Survey is the first patient reported
outcome measure included in the U.S. Medicare End Stage Renal Disease
Quality Incentive Program. Administered twice yearly, it assesses
in-center dialysis experience and survey responses are tied to dialysis
facility payments. Low response rates, currently approximately 35%,
raise concern for possible underrepresentation of patient groups.
Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of survey administration in 2012 to
all in-center hemodialysis patients in Dialysis Clinic, Inc. (DCI)
facilities nationally over 18 years old who received hemodialysis at
their facility for at least 3 months. Patient-level covariates included
demographic, clinical, laboratory, and functional characteristics.
Random effects multivariable logistic regression was used to assess
survey non-response.
Results: Among 11,055 eligible patients 6541 (59%) were non-responders.
Of the remaining 4514 responders, 549 (14%) surveys were not usable due
to presence of proxy help or incomplete responses. Non-responders were
more likely to be men, non-white, younger, single, dual
Medicare/Medicaid eligible, less educated, non-English speaking, and not
active on the transplant list; non-responders had longer ESRD vintage,
lower body mass index, lower serum albumin, worse functional status, and
more hospitalizations, missed treatments, and shortened treatments.
Similar associations were found using more parsimonious multivariable
analyses and after imputing missing data.
Conclusions: Non-responders to the ICH CAHPS significantly differed from
responders, broadly spanning individuals with fewer socioeconomic
advantages and greater illness burden, raising limitations in
interpreting facility survey results. Future research should assess
reasons for non-response to improve ICH CAHPS generalizability and
utility.

N2  - Criminological researchers want people to reveal considerable private
information when utilizing self-report surveys, such as involvement in
crime, subjective attitudes and expectations, and probability judgments.
Some of this private information is easily accessible for subjects and
all that is required is for individuals to be honest, while other
information requires mental effort and cognitive reflection. Though
researchers generally provide little or no incentive to be honest and
thoughtful, it is generally assumed that subjects do provide honest and
accurate information. We assess the accuracy of deterrence measures by
employing a scoring rule known as the Bayesian truth serum (BTS)-that
incentivizes honesty and thoughtfulness among respondents.
Individuals are asked to report on self-report offending and estimates
of risk after being assigned to one of two conditions: (1) a group where
there is a financial incentive just for participation, and (2) a BTS
financial incentive group where individuals are incentivized to be
honest and thoughtful.
We find evidence that there are some important differences in the
responses to self-reporting offending items and estimates of the
probability of getting arrested between the groups. Individuals in the
BTS condition report a greater willingness to offend and lower estimates
of perceived risk for drinking and driving and cheating on exams.
Moreover, we find that the negative correlation between perceived risk
and willingness to offend that is often observed in scenario-based
deterrence research does not emerge in conditions where respondents are
incentivized to be accurate and thoughtful in their survey responses.
The results raise some questions about the accuracy of survey responses
in perceptual deterrence studies, and challenge the statistical
relationship between perceived risk and offending behavior. We suggest
further exploration within criminology of both BTS and other scoring
rules and greater scrutiny of the validity of criminological data.

T1  - The doctor-patient relationship, defensive medicine and overprescription in Chinese public hospitals: Evidence from a cross-sectional survey in Shenzhen city

N2  - Defensive medicine describes physicians' behavioral response to threats
from medical malpractice litigation. Previous studies have found
widespread practice of defensive medicine that is responsible for the
global escalation of health care costs. Defying the traditional
explanations, this study, with a case of a Chinese city, reveals that in
a country where medical malpractice lawsuits are rare, physicians'
self-perceived threats from patients may constitute a major reason for
defensive practices. Defensive behaviors in the Chinese context mainly
take the form of overprescribing diagnostic tests, procedures and drugs.
The existing literature tends to explain this in terms of Chinese
doctors' desire to supplement their low incomes. Behind this is a series
of misaligned incentives deeply embedded in the Chinese health system.
Using a cross-sectional survey of physicians, this study shows that
overprescription in Chinese hospitals is driven not only by hard
economic incentives, but also by doctors' motive of avoiding disputes
with patients. The survey was carried out in Shenzhen City, in December
2013. A sample containing 504 licensed physicians was drawn by random
sampling. Descriptive analyses identified significant dissatisfaction
with income and workload as well as severe tensions between doctors and
patients. Drawing from the literature on defensive medicine,
multivariate analysis revealed that physicians' previous experience of
medical disputes is significantly associated with defensive behaviors,
particularly overprescription. Low income continued to be a critical
predictor, reinforcing the target income hypothesis and suggesting the
resilience of perverse economic incentives. This study sheds fresh light
on China's recent health policy reforms by highlighting the critical
impact of the doctor patient relationship. The effort to contain health
care costs must progress on two fronts, mitigating the tensions between
doctors and patients while still reforming the remuneration scheme
cautiously to enable physicians to respond to right incentives. (C) 2014

N2  - Objectives
Federal policies are incentivizing hospitals and providers to adopt and
meaningfully use electronic health records (EHRs). Nursing homes are not
eligible for incentives. However, understanding health information
technology (HIT) adoption among nursing homes will be critical to
developing HIT policies for this sector. Our objective was to assess the
pace of EHR adoption, changes in computerized function adoption, and
participation in health information exchange by New York state nursing
homes over time.
Study Design
We used a repeated, cross-sectional study design.
Methods
We surveyed all New York state nursing homes between February and May
2013, comparing results to the same survey administered in 2012. Results
We received responses from 472 of 630 nursing homes (74.9%). Rates of
EHR adoption increased from 48.6% to 56.3% (P = .03). Participation in
health information exchange remained unchanged (54.5% to 55.3%, P =
.8). The top barriers to EHR adoption cited were: a) the initial cost of
HIT investment (67.9%, n = 133), b) lack of technical IT staff (46.4%,
n = 91), and c) lack of fiscal incentives (45.8%, n = 88). Comparing
nursing homes with EHRs in 2012 to nursing homes with EHRs in 2013, the
availability of many types of computerized functionalities significantly
increased, although no gains were seen for order entry or clinical
tools.
Conclusions
While some gains are being made by nursing homes, HIT adoption generally
lags behind that of other sectors. Public policy focusing on building
HIT infrastructure is essential to ensure that nursing homes keep up
with other healthcare segments.

N2  - Four months into a year-long, national survey assessing parents'
experiences of a child's diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, our
response fraction was only 23%. We aimed to determine whether including
a chocolate incentive in the postal survey would increase the response
fraction. Families enrolled between 15 March and 25 May 2012 were
randomised to receive a chocolate frog versus no chocolate frog. Both
groups received a written reminder and replacement survey 2 weeks after
the survey was posted and up to two telephone reminders thereafter. We
analysed the effect of the incentive using (2) tests for the categorical
response variable and t-tests for the continuous reminder and length of
response variables at the end of (i) randomisation and (ii) the study
(1November 2012). A total of 137 families were randomised in the 6-week
period. Parents who received an incentive were more likely to return a
completed survey in the 6 weeks than those who did not (21% vs. 6%,
P=0.009). This effect faded by the end of the study (53% vs. 42%,
P=0.4). There were no differences between groups at either follow-up in
the number of reminders that parents received or the number of days it
took parents to return the survey. Including a chocolate-based incentive
does not significantly increase response rate in a postal survey over
and above standard reminder techniques like posting follow-up survey
packs or phoning families.

N2  - Background: The US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services assess
patient experiences of care as part of the end-stage renal disease
prospective payment system and Quality Incentive Program. This article
describes the development and evaluation of the Consumer Assessment of
Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) In-Center Hemodialysis Survey.
Study Design: We conducted formative research to generate survey
questions and performed statistical analyses to evaluate the survey's
measurement properties.
Setting & Participants: Formative research included focus groups,
cognitive interviews, and field testing the survey with dialysis
patients.
Measurements & Outcomes: We assessed internal consistency reliability
(Cronbach alpha) and center-level reliability for 3 multi-item scales.
We evaluated construct validity using correlations of the scales with
global ratings of the kidney doctor, staff, and dialysis center.
Results: Response rate was 46% (1,454 completed surveys). Analyses
support 3 multi-item scales: Nephrologists' Communication and Caring (7
items, alpha = 0.89), Quality of Dialysis Center Care and Operations (22
items, alpha = 0.93), and Providing Information to Patients (11 items,
alpha = 0.75). The communication scale was correlated the most strongly
with the global rating of the ``kidney doctor{''} (r = 0.78). The
Dialysis Center Care and Operations scale was correlated most strongly
with global ratings of staff (r = 0.75) and the center (r = 0.69).
Providing Information to Patients was correlated most strongly with the
global rating of the staff (r = 0.41).
Limitations: A relatively small number of patients completed the survey
in Spanish.
Conclusions: This study provides support for the reliability and
validity of the CAHPS In-Center Hemodialysis Survey for assessing
patient experiences of care at dialysis facilities. The survey can be
used to compare care provided at different facilities. (C) 2014 by the

N2  - This research investigates how retail businesses may promote their
products online to induce offline sales via social media-enabled
online-to-offline (O2O) commerce. We focus on a country context where
such an emerging e-commerce model is particularly prevalent, i.e.,
China. Key to leveraging this model is to attract consumer attention and
stimulate their actions both online and offline, which may be achieved
through information technology (IT)-enabled promotional approaches, such
as administering banner adverts and digital coupons. The former focuses
on communicating product attribute information, whereas the latter
focuses on communicating incentives. Building on a collectivism cultural
perspective, word-of-mouth (WOM) communication motives framework, and
digital advertising literature, we hypothesize their different effects
online (generating produce review) and offline (inducing sales). We
first conducted a survey comparing consumers in China with their U. S.
counterparts, and show that a cultural perspective is pertinent and
valuable. We then collaborated with China's largest O2O social media
website for restaurant reviews, and conducted a field investigation of
consumer responses to the two promotional approaches. Our findings
afford important insights for retail businesses seeking to leverage O2O
commerce, and provide research implications to the areas of e-commerce
and digital advertising.

N2  - Physicians, like other professionals, are expected to draw from
specialized knowledge while remaining receptive to clients' requests.
Using nationally representative U.S. survey data from the Community
Tracking Study, this paper examines the degree to which physicians are
influenced by patients' requests, and how physicians' workplaces may
mediate acquiescence rates through three mechanisms: constraints,
protection, and incentives. We find that, based on physicians' reports
of their responses to patients' suggestions, patient influence is rare.
This influence is least likely to be felt in large workplaces, such as
large private practices, hospitals, and medical schools. We find that
the protection and incentives mechanisms mediate the relationship
between workplace types and physician acquiescence but more prescriptive
measures such as guidelines and formularies do not affect acquiescence.
We discuss these findings in light of the ongoing changes in the
structure of medicine. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Financial (positive or negative) and non-financial incentives or rewards
are increasingly used in attempts to influence health behaviours. While
unintended consequences of incentive provision are discussed in the
literature, evidence syntheses did not identify any primary research
with the aim of investigating unintended consequences of incentive
interventions for lifestyle behaviour change. Our objective was to
investigate perceived positive and negative unintended consequences of
incentive provision for a shortlist of seven promising incentive
strategies for smoking cessation in pregnancy and breastfeeding. A
multi-disciplinary, mixed-methods approach included involving two
service-user mother and baby groups from disadvantaged areas with
experience of the target behaviours as study co-investigators.
Systematic reviews informed the shortlist of incentive strategies.
Qualitative semi-structured interviews and a web-based survey of health
professionals asked open questions on positive and negative consequences
of incentives. The participants from three UK regions were a diverse
sample with and without direct experience of incentive interventions: 88
pregnant women/recent mothers/partners/family members; 53 service
providers; 24 experts/decision makers and interactive discussions with
63 conference attendees. Maternity and early years health professionals
(n = 497) including doctors, midwives, health visitors, public health
and related staff participated in the survey. Qualitative analysis
identified ethical, political, cultural, social and psychological
implications of incentive delivery at population and individual levels.
Four key themes emerged: how incentives can address or create
inequalities; enhance or diminish intrinsic motivation and wellbeing;
have a positive or negative effect on relationships with others within
personal networks or health providers; and can impact on health systems
and resources by raising awareness and directing service delivery, but
may be detrimental to other health care areas. Financial incentives are
controversial and generated emotive and oppositional responses. The
planning, design and delivery of future incentive interventions should
evaluate unexpected consequences to inform the evidence for
effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and future implementation.

N2  - Background: Experiences and attitudes of clinical trainers of
undergraduate medical students and postgraduate medical trainees in
secondary care have received limited attention. Anecdotally, clinical
teaching is becoming increasingly restricted by clinical service
pressures, thereby presenting a risk to the quality of training
provision.
Methods: To explore the commitment, experience and attitudes of clinical
teachers and trainers of undergraduate medical students and postgraduate
trainees, respectively, amongst secondary care providers across a UK
Healthcare Workforce Deanery, an invitation to complete a
study-specific, on-line survey, comprising predominantly yes/no response
and 5-point Likert scale statements with some open questions, was sent
to all registered secondary care trainers/supervisors working in the
East Midlands Strategic Health Authority. The survey was open between
February and June 2012, with two reminders to complete. Responses were
anonymised and the frequency of responses to questions was analysed.
Data were analysed for the whole study population and for the
relationship between frequency of responses and gender.
Results: The majority of teachers/trainers considered that they were
well prepared and fulfilled their clinical teaching responsibilities.
Many reported having restricted time for preparation and delivery and
that teaching activities were often completed in their own time. Despite
reported poor support and low incentives, many respondents felt valued
for their clinical teaching by their Medical Schools and the Deanery,
but less so by hospital Trusts.
Conclusions: Respondents indicated that some faculty like and enjoy
clinical teaching despite lack of allocated time, resources and
recognition. The majority indicated that they feel confident and
competent in their clinical teaching roles. Insufficient dedicated time
due to competing clinical service pressures was reported as the major
barrier to clinical teaching provision.

N2  - Background: The Hookup is a collaborative project reaching young people
in California with valuable sexual and reproductive health information
and linkage to local resources. Due to limited access to subscriber
contact information, it has been a challenge to evaluate the program.
Objective: The aims of this study were to determine the feasibility of
using text messaging (short message service, SMS) as an evaluation tool
for an educational text message-based program and to evaluate the
program itself.
Methods: All subscribers of The Hookup were sent four survey questions
via SMS about age, gender, location, referral source and behavior
change. An incentive was offered for completing the survey and an
opt-out option was provided in the initial message.
Results: All existing subscribers of The Hookup (N=2477) received a
request to complete the survey using the SMS application on their mobile
phones. A total of 832 (33.6%) subscribers responded to the initial
question and 481 (20%) answered all four questions. Of the responses,
85% were received in the first two hours of the initial request.
Respondents who answered the question about behavior change, 90%
reported having made some positive change since subscribing to Hookup,
including getting tested for STDs and HIV.
Conclusions: The survey methodology initiated a high response rate from
The Hookup subscribers. The survey was able to provide data about
subscribers in a short time period at minimal cost. The results show
potential for using mobile SMS applications to evaluate SMS campaigns.
The findings also support using SMS to provide young people with sexual
health prevention messaging and linkage to health services.

N2  - Purpose: In response to calls for more specificity when measuring
physical activity, this study examined perceived correlates of this
behavior in rural adults separately by the domain in which this behavior
occurs (ie, home care, work, active living, and sport).
Methods: A cross-sectional survey was completed by 407 adults from 2
rural towns in the Midwest. The questionnaire assessed the perceived
social and physical environment, including neighborhood characteristics,
as well as barriers to being active. The Kaiser Physical Activity Survey
captured domain-specific activity levels. The response rate was 25%.
Multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine the associations
between social and physical environment factors and domain-specific
physical activity.
Findings: Having a favorable attitude toward using government funds for
exercise and activity-friendly neighborhood characteristic were
positively associated with active living. Friends encouraging exercise
was positively associated with participation in sport. Barriers were
inversely associated with active living and sport. Total physical
activity was positively associated with workplace incentives for
exercise, favorable policy attitudes toward supporting physical
education in schools and supporting the use of government funds for
biking trails, and it was inversely associated with barriers. There were
no factors associated with physical activity in the domains of work or
home care.
Conclusions: Correlates of physical activity are unique to the domain in
which this behavior occurs. Programs to increase physical activity in
rural adults should target policy attitudes, neighborhood
characteristics, and social support from friends while also working to
decrease personal barriers to exercise.

N2  - A workforce crisis for many pediatric specialties, particularly
nephrology, is due to growing retirement rates, attrition during
training, and retention difficulties. To obtain specific information
regarding pediatric nephrology trainee shortages, we administered two
cross-sectional surveys to non-renal pediatric subspecialty fellows and
pediatric nephrology program directors. We characterized the fellows'
experiences with nephrology and the program directors' experiences with
their fellows as well as their outcomes in the last 10 years. We
analyzed responses from 531 non-renal fellows (14.4% response rate).
Overall, 317 (60%) fellows rated nephrology as difficult, particularly
women (65.4% vs. 49.5%, p<0.001), with American women medical
graduates rating nephrology as more difficult compared to all others (p
= 0.001). More men than women (24% vs. 8%, p<0.001) considered the
monetary benefit as not adequate. Program directors (25; 64% response
rate) represented 57% of all USA fellows in training, and 15 (60%)
found it difficult to recruit qualified applicants. Of the 183 graduates
in the past 10 years, 35 (19%) were reported as not in the USA
pediatric nephrology workforce. These findings support our belief that a
strong effort needs to be made by the academic community to teach
nephrology in more interesting and understandable formats. While these
are national samples, we were unable to contact non-nephrology fellows
directly and program directors from larger programs were
underrepresented. Difficulties in attracting/retaining trainees
(particularly women) to nephrology must be addressed systematically,
identifying incentives to practice in this field. Bold concerted efforts
are required and we propose seven steps to achieve this goal.

N2  - This study examined how agricultural households involved in China's
Sloping Land Conversion Program (SLCP) could respond to expected changes
in environmental and livestock policies and changing commodity prices.
We calibrated a farm household model using 2009 survey data collected in
northeast Gansu Province, China, and examined the responses of four
different household groups. Household groups were distinguished based on
the resources they possessed for either cropping, livestock husbandry or
off-farm employment. We also calculated the opportunity cost of
converting sloping land from grain crop production to perennial grass
production and included the net value of the replacement crop in these
calculations. Our model simulations indicated that subsistence-oriented
households were most likely to participate in the SLCP, and that SLCP
payment reductions could have large negative income effects for this
group. Reductions in SLCP payments increased income inequality among
households in the study area. Migration- and cropping-oriented
households have fewer incentives to participate in the SLCP. With rising
commodity prices, SLCP payments need to rise to avoid that
subsistence-oriented households reconvert their land from perennial
grasses to annual grain crops. Local government policies related to
livestock production are being devised in Gansu as a method to lift
incomes, and these policies could also have positive environmental
benefits by increasing grass production on sloping land. The
introduction of these livestock promotion policies had modest income
effects but did not alter the area grown with grasses under the SLCP.

N2  - Although a large body of research exists discussing the subject of
drought management and the mechanisms that are employed by farmers to
formulate decisions during such an event, the farmers' response to
drought remains poorly understood due to the oversimplified assumptions
about farmers' behavior in response to drought. Furthermore, little is
known about the potential efficacy of the coping strategies that are
adopted by farmers. To gather this knowledge, a mixed method,
qualitative-quantitative study was conducted in Fars province, Iran. A
survey of 255 farmers, selected through a multistage stratified random
sampling method, revealed that farmers' decisions to manage a drought
were the result of a complex web of natural, economic, structural, and
cognitive factors. Additionally, an analysis of decision models revealed
that there were different patterns of coping responses utilized in the
different stages of drought that expanded from short-term adjustment to
long-term adaptation. Furthermore, a decision tree analysis indicated
that although a large percentage of farmers made some adjustments in
response to drought, they were not able to overcome the increasing
impacts of the drought. In this respect, it was recommended to consider
various economic incentives, promote affordable coping strategies, and
combine agricultural interventions with social support services. (C)

N2  - The present model of employment specified in the Mental Health Nurse
Incentive Program (MHNIP) is closely aligned to a traditional practice
nurse model whereby the nurse is employed to assist and extend medical
practice.
Mental health nurses working within MHNIP typically possess post
graduate qualifications and a breadth of experience characteristic of a
specialist and advanced practitioner in mental health.
Mental health nurses ought to enjoy the same status, level of
remuneration, professional esteem and accountability of other health
professionals.
AbstractThe Mental Health Nurse Incentive Programme (MHNIP) provides
funding to organizations to enable mental health nurses (MHNs) to
provide care to people with complex needs in primary care settings in
Australia. The programme is based on a for and on-behalf of' practice
nursing model whereby the MHN is presumed to have no specialist
knowledge, skills or professional autonomy, and rather extends the reach
of medicine. This paper provides a profile of MHNs working in the MHNIP
derived from an online survey. A content analysis of responses
establishes that nurses who work within MHNIP are highly experienced,
and have extensive postgraduate qualifications particularly in
psychotherapy. Nurses have negotiated a range of complex employment and
contractual arrangements with organizations and pushed the boundaries of
the programme to realize good outcomes. The practice nurse model' of
employment and the underpinning assumptions about MHNs and their skill
set relative to other professions is critically examined. Changes to the
programme funding mechanism and programme specifications are
recommended.

N2  - Background. - Healthcare professionals play a critical role in women's
choice of contraceptive methods. However, national surveys on sexual and
reproductive health (SRH) among physicians are rare and present low
participation rates. We conducted a randomized trial to test for the
effectiveness of three interventions to improve survey participation of
private physicians delivering reproductive health services in France.
Methods. - The study comprised a national random sample of 500 general
practitioners and 500 gynecologists working in private offices. All
received a postal invitation to participate either by completing a
paper, phone or online questionnaire. Physicians were randomly assigned
to six groups to test for the effect of three interventions: a
non-monetary incentive in the form of a scientific book, telephone
contact, and the possibility of completing the questionnaire by phone.
Results. - Overall, 362 questionnaires were collected (26 online, 2 by
phone) and 58 physicians were ineligible. The completion rate increased
from 26.7% in physicians who received no intervention to 42.7% in
those who received the book and a phone call. The phone call increased
the completion rate by 11% percentage points (P = 0.01), while the book
had no significant effect. Results from multivariate logistic
regressions also indicate that gynecologists (OR = 1.6) and female
physicians (OR = 1.5) were more likely to participate than others.
Conclusion. - The results suggest that phone calls substantially
increase participation of physicians in sexual and reproductive health
surveys but have little impact on sampling distortion. Differentials in
response rates by physicians' characteristics should be considered in
future SRH studies among physicians. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

N2  - Background: Anonymous survey methods appear to promote greater
disclosure of sensitive or stigmatizing information compared to
non-anonymous methods. Higher disclosure rates have traditionally been
interpreted as being more accurate than lower rates. We examined the
impact of 3 increasingly private mailed survey conditions-ranging from
potentially identifiable to completely anonymous-on survey response and
on respondents' representativeness of the underlying sampling frame,
completeness in answering sensitive survey items, and disclosure of
sensitive information. We also examined the impact of 2 incentives ($10
versus $20) on these outcomes.
Methods: A 3X2 factorial, randomized controlled trial of 324
representatively selected, male Gulf War I era veterans who had applied
for United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability
benefits. Men were asked about past sexual assault experiences,
childhood abuse, combat, other traumas, mental health symptoms, and
sexual orientation. We used a novel technique, the pre-merged
questionnaire, to link anonymous responses to administrative data.
Results: Response rates ranged from 56.0% to 63.3% across privacy
conditions (p = 0.49) and from 52.8% to 68.1% across incentives (p =
0.007). Respondents' characteristics differed by privacy and by
incentive assignments, with completely anonymous respondents and $20
respondents appearing least different from their non-respondent
counterparts. Survey completeness did not differ by privacy or by
incentive. No clear pattern of disclosing sensitive information by
privacy condition or by incentive emerged. For example, although all
respondents came from the same sampling frame, estimates of sexual abuse
ranged from 13.6% to 33.3% across privacy conditions, with the highest
estimate coming from the intermediate privacy condition (p = 0.007).
Conclusion: Greater privacy and larger incentives do not necessarily
result in higher disclosure rates of sensitive information than lesser
privacy and lower incentives. Furthermore, disclosure of sensitive or
stigmatizing information under differing privacy conditions may have
less to do with promoting or impeding participants' ``honesty{''} or
``accuracy{''} than with selectively recruiting or attracting
subpopulations that are higher or lower in such experiences. Pre-merged
questionnaires bypassed many historical limitations of anonymous surveys
and hold promise for exploring non-response issues in future research.

N2  - Introduction
In 2011, San Francisco passed the first citywide ordinance to improve
the nutritional standards of children's meals sold at restaurants by
preventing the giving away of free toys or other incentives with meals
unless nutritional criteria were met. This study examined the impact of
the Healthy Food Incentives Ordinance at ordinance-affected restaurants
on restaurant response (eg, toy-distribution practices, change in
children's menus), and the energy and nutrient content of all orders and
children's-meal only orders purchased for children aged 0 through 12
years.
Methods
Restaurant responses were examined from January 2010 through March 2012.
Parent caregiver/child dyads (n = 762) who were restaurant customers
were surveyed at 2 points before and 1 seasonally matched point after
ordinance enactment at Chain A and B restaurants (n = 30) in 2011 and
2012.
Results
Both restaurant chains responded to the ordinance by selling toys
separately from children's meals, but neither changed their menus to
meet ordinance-specified nutrition criteria. Among children for whom
children's meals were purchased, significant decreases in kilocalories,
sodium, and fat per order were likely due to changes in children's side
dishes and beverages at Chain A.
Conclusion Although the changes at Chain A did not appear to be directly
in response to the ordinance, the transition to a more healthful
beverage and default side dish was consistent with the intent of the
ordinance. Study results underscore the importance of policy wording,
support the concept that more healthful defaults may be a powerful
approach for improving dietary intake, and suggest that public policies
may contribute to positive restaurant changes.

N2  - There is anecdotal evidence that the adoption of building information
modeling (BIM) is on the increase. However, the extent to which quantity
surveyors (QS) (also referred to as cost consultants or cost engineers)
are now using BIM features is not clear. The research reported in this
paper was aimed at understanding the BIM experience of QS firms and cost
consultants in Australia as well as to understand the progress they have
made towards the use of BIM features. Data collection was a web-based
survey of 180 QS firms with 40 responses and two in-depth interviews.
Findings from the study show that BIM features are not readily used by
QS firms owing to uncertainties concerning the integrity of
three-dimensional (3D) models issued by designers, incomplete
information in models, lack of knowledge concerning new business
processes to drive the use of BIM use, lack of demand by clients, cost
of implementing BIM features within the existing practice and learning
time required to adopt BIM features. It appears that most of the firms
have experience in computer aided take-off with two-dimensional (2D)
drawing in the project's front end tasks such as cost planning and bill
of quantities. Most of them have little experience with automated
extraction of quantities using 3D models. Only one experience the use of
BIM features in contract administration duties. 3D computer-aided
drawing (CAD) drawings are used only for visualization. In many
BIM-based projects reported, cost consultants were not issued the 3D BIM
developed by designers; instead, 2D drawings were issued to the QS for
quantity take-off and cost estimation. In cases where automatic quantity
extraction was performed using 3D models, there seems to be lack of
clarity concerning the time savings achieved because the QS spent more
time checking the accuracy of the 3D model prior to quantity extraction
as well as sorting, and splitting take-off items. In the absence of
trust in the integrity of 3D models, QS would prefer to use the manual
on screen take-off using 2D drawings and 3D for visualization. Also, in
the absence of industry-wide standard for classifying, and coding
construction works, QS would have no incentive to switch to
five-dimensional (5D) BIM estimating. Ways of increasing the use of BIM
features by QS are highlighted. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil

N2  - Introduction and Aims. Many young adults are risky drinkers who are
often missed by general population surveys. The aim of the present study
was to assess factors affecting participation rates in a street
intercept approach to recruiting young adult bar-goers for an online
survey. Design and Methods. Two hundred eighty-seven young adults were
approached as they entered the bar district of a medium-sized city on
two consecutive weekend nights. Of these, 170 met eligibility
requirements and were invited to complete a 2 min street survey for
which they were paid $5 and given a gift card for $50 or $100 to be
redeemed when they completed a follow-up online survey. Results.
Sixty-one per cent of eligible persons (n = 104) participated in the
street survey, with greater participation on the second night (74% vs.
50%). Sixty-eight per cent (n = 71) of those who participated in the
street survey completed the online survey, with no differences in
response by age or student status; however, men were significantly more
likely to complete the online survey if they received the higher
incentive, had consumed less alcohol and were recruited before midnight.
The larger incentive was especially effective at increasing completion
rates for men who had consumed a larger amount of alcohol. Discussion
and Conclusions. Street intercept is an effective and efficient
recruitment method that can measure both drinking and other experiences
in the event and link these data to information collected in follow-up
research. Unlike recruitment through convenience samples, response rates
and response bias can also be assessed.

N2  - The incentive dilemma refers to a situation in which incentives are
offered but do not work as intended. The authors suggest that, in an
interorganizational context, whether a principal-provided incentive
works is a function of how it is evaluated by an agent: for its
contribution to the agent's bottom line (instrumental evaluation) and
for the extent it is strategically aligned with the agent's direction
(congruence evaluation). To further understand when incentives work, the
influence of two key contextual variables-industry volatility and
dependence-are examined. A field study featuring 57 semi-structured
depth interviews and 386 responses from twin surveys in the information
technology and brewing industries provide data for hypothesis testing.
When and whether incentives work is demonstrated by certain conditions
under which the agent's evaluation of an incentive has positive or
negative effects on its compliance and active representation. Further,
some outcomes are reversed in the high volatility condition.

N2  - Purpose. A national census survey of optometrists in Canada measured
knowledge of ocular diseases associated with smoking cigarettes and
current practice behaviors related to addressing tobacco use with
patients, including prevention and cessation. Optometrists were also
asked to identify tools to assist addressing tobacco use with patients.
Methods. An online bilingual (English/French) survey was developed and
an e-mail with a link to the survey was sent to all 4528 optometrists
registered in Canada. No participation incentives were provided.
Frequency data were tabulated for survey items. Logistic regression
models were fit to understand respondent characteristics associated with
discussing tobacco use prevention and cessation with patients.
Results. The response rate was 19% (850 responses). Almost all
respondents (98%) believed that smoking cigarettes was a risk factor
for developing age-related macular degeneration; approximately half
(55%) assessed the smoking status of patients during their initial
visit; 7% reported that they discussed the benefits of tobacco use
prevention with patients younger than 19 years; and 33% reported that
they always or regularly assess their patients' interest in quitting
smoking. Respondents who completed the survey in English were more
likely (odds ratio, 2.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.01 to 5.65) to
deliver prevention messaging, compared with respondents who completed
the survey in French. Male respondents were less likely to assess
patients' interest in quitting (odds ratio, 0.7; 95% confidence
interval, 0.50 to 0.97) than female respondents. Most respondents (90%)
were interested in a continuing education program about the impact of
smoking on vision and eye health as well as strategies for discussing
tobacco cessation and prevention.
Conclusions. Optometrists are aware of the impact of smoking on ocular
health; however, most respondents do not systematically engage in
tobacco use prevention and cessation practices. Providing optometrists
with tools, including continuing education, may help support patient
conversations about the risks of tobacco use and improve public health.

N2  - This study examines the preferences of general practitioners (GPs) in
training for organizational characteristics in general practice with
focus on aspects that can mitigate problems with GP shortages.
A discrete choice experiment was used to investigate preferences for the
attributes practice type, number of GPs in general practice,
collaboration with other practices, change in weekly working hours
(administrative versus patient related), and change in yearly surplus.
In May 2011, all doctors actively engaged in the family medicine program
in Denmark were invited to participate in a web-based survey. A total of
485 GPs in training responded to the questionnaire, resulting in a
response rate of 56 %.
A mixed logit model showed that GPs in training prefer to work in
smaller shared practices (2 GPs). This stands in contrast to the
preferences of current GPs. Hence, a generational change in the GP
population is likely to introduce more productive practice forms, and
problems with GP shortages are likely to be mitigated over the coming
years. Results further showed that a majority of the respondents are
willing to work in larger shared practices (with 3-4 GPs) if they
receive an increase in surplus (approximately 50,000 DKK/6,719 EUR per
year) and that they may be willing to take in more patient-related work
if the increase in surplus is sufficient (approximately 200,000
DKK/26,875 EUR per year for 5 extra hours per week). Monetary incentives
may therefore be an effective tool for further improving productivity.

N2  - Communication risk is of crucial importance in construction projects.
The situation in which one of the project parties is better informed
than another is known as information asymmetry. This problem is
addressed by the principal-agent theory. According to this theory,
information asymmetries cause three problems: adverse selection, moral
hazard, and hold up. The focus here is on strategies for minimizing
information asymmetries in the construction phase. A survey of project
managers was conducted to establish an understanding of the relative
importance of risk-minimization strategies established in the
literature: bureaucratic control (contracts), information systems,
incentives (bonuses), corporate culture, reputation, and trust. The
multi-attribute utility theory was used to analyze the responses.
According to the project managers who participated in the survey, trust
is the most important strategy in the construction phase, followed by
bureaucratic control (contracts) and information systems.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Ten years ago, the specialty of trauma surgery was
considered to be in crisis. Since then, the Eastern Association for the
Surgery of Trauma (EAST) created a position paper, and acute care
surgery (ACS) has matured. A repeat survey of EAST members is indicated
to evaluate the progress of ACS.
METHODS: A survey was e-mailed to EAST members. Results were evaluated
and compared with the previous position paper and survey.
RESULTS: The response rate was 15%. More than three fourths of the
respondents were male, and just less than one fourth of them were
female. More than half of the respondents were in practice for less than
10 years. Seventy-three percent were involved in research, although only
16% were allotted protected time. Most respondents felt that
reimbursement for their effort was inadequate: 54% thought
reimbursement was fair for trauma care, 59% for critical care, 49% for
nontrauma ACS, and 62% for general surgery. The biggest incentive to a
career in ACS was that it was a challenging and exciting activity; the
biggest disincentive was working at night. Seventy-two percent expressed
satisfaction with their career profile, and 92% were either very or
somewhat happy with their career. Sixty-six percent did feel either
somewhat or very burned out. Surgeons were interested in learning more
about contract negotiation, business/managerial issues, and
billing/coding. Compared with the previous survey, overall career
satisfaction seems stable.
CONCLUSION: Most surgeons are satisfied with a career in ACS. There are
still some facets of the career that warrant improvement. Focus on
surgeon satisfaction may lead to enhancements in patient care. (J Trauma

N2  - The Taiwan government has been promoting Electronic Health Records
(EHRs) to primary care physicians. How to extend EHRs adoption rate by
measuring physicians' perspective of importance and performance of EHRs
has become one of the critical issues for healthcare organizations. We
conducted a comprehensive survey in 2010 in which a total of 1034
questionnaires which were distributed to primary care physicians. The
project was sponsored by the Department of Health to accelerate the
adoption of EHRs. 556 valid responses were analyzed resulting in a valid
response rate of 53.77%. The data were analyzed based on a
data-centered analytical framework (5-point Likert scale). The mean of
importance and satisfaction of four dimensions were 4.16, 3.44
(installation and maintenance), 4.12, 3.51 (product effectiveness),
4.10, 3.31 (system function) and 4.34, 3.70 (customer service)
respectively. This study provided a direction to government by focusing
on attributes which physicians found important but were dissatisfied
with, to close the gap between actual and expected performance of the
EHRs. The authorities should emphasize the potential advantages in
meaningful use and provide training programs, conferences, technical
assistance and incentives to enhance the national level implementation
of EHRs for primary physicians.

N2  - Background: Volunteer community health workers (CHWs) are a key approach
to improving community-based maternal and child health services in
developing countries. BRAC, a large Bangladeshi non-governmental
organization (NGO), has employed female volunteer CHWs in its
community-based health programs since 1977, recently including its
Manoshi project, a community-based maternal and child health
intervention in the urban slums of Bangladesh. A case-control study
conducted in response to high dropout rates in the first year of the
project showed that financial incentives, social prestige, community
approval and household responsibilities were related to early retention
in the project. In our present prospective cohort study, we aimed to
better understand the factors associated with retention of volunteer
CHWs once the project was more mature.
Methods: We used a prospective cohort study design to examine the
factors affecting retention of volunteer CHWs who remained in the
project after the initial start-up period. We surveyed a random sample
of 542 CHWs who were working for BRAC Manoshi in December 2008. In
December 2009, we revisited this cohort of CHWs and interviewed those
who had dropped out about the main reasons for their dropping out. We
used a multivariable generalized linear model regression analysis with a
log link to estimate the relative risk (RR) of independent factors on
retention.
Results: Of the 542 CHWs originally enrolled, 120 had dropped out by the
end of one year, mainly because they left the slums. CHWs who received
positive community appraisal (adjusted RR = 1.45, 95% confidence
interval (CI) = 1.10 to 1.91) or were associated with other NGOs
(adjusted RR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.23) were more likely to have
been retained in the project. Although refresher training was also
associated with increased retention (adjusted RR = 2.25, 95% CI = 1.08
to 4.71) in this study, too few CHWs had not attended refresher training
regularly to make it a meaningful predictor of retention that could be
applied in the project setting.
Conclusion: Factors that affect retention of CHWs may change over time,
with some factors that are important in the early years of a project
losing importance as the project matures. Community health programs
operating in fragile urban slums should consider changing factors over
program duration for better retention of volunteer CHWs.

N2  - Background: A training physician has his first interaction with a
pharmaceutical representative during medical school. Medical students
are often provided with small gifts such as pens, calendars and books,
as well as free lunches as part of drug promotion offers. Ethical impact
of these transactions as perceived by young medical students has not
been investigated in Pakistan before. This study aimed to assess the
association of socio-demographic variables with the attitudes of medical
students towards pharmaceutical companies and their incentives.
Methods: As part of a cross-sectional survey, a validated questionnaire
previously used for assessing attitude of medical students towards
pharmaceutical industry, was modified, pre-tested and distributed among
consenting clinical year students at DUHS and AKU. Questions included
acceptability of pharmaceutically sponsored gifts, events and tuition
fee, and their impact on future prescription. Responses were graded as
agree, disagree or neutral which were then scored according to the AMSA
guidelines of ethical conduct.
Results: Out of a total of 353 targeted students 303 responded,
corresponding to a response rate of 85.8%. Responses indicated that
42.7% students believed in no interaction with drug companies during
medical school. However, 81% of students favored pharmaceutical
sponsorship of student-body events/seminars at medical colleges. More
than one-third of the students were comfortable receiving gifts from
drug companies. Overall, the results of this study offer an interesting
comparison between the students of a private medical school (AKU) and a
public medical school (DUHS); AKU students exhibited a greater degree of
mistrust towards drug information provided by pharmaceutical companies
compared to DUHS students (p = 0.040). Furthermore, when asked if there
was a need to incorporate guidelines in the undergraduate curriculum
with regard to interaction with drug companies, 84.2% students at AKU
agreed, compared to 54.9% at DUHS. Medical student Attitude Scores are
more or less similar to each other independent of their various
demographical differences.
Conclusion: This study highlights that medical students in our
population have a high level of acceptability towards incentives offered
by pharmaceutical industry and that formal guidance regarding the
subject should be incorporated into medical curriculum.

N2  - The objective of this study was to develop an understanding of producer
preferences for land-based biological carbon (C) sequestration in
agriculture. We conducted a mail survey in a US production region to
elicit farmers' willingness to participate in different C credit
programs in a hypothetical greenhouse gas mitigation market. We used the
survey data to calibrate a behavior model in a benefit-cost framework
that characterizes farmers' decisions about C program participation in
relation to preferences and the attributes of both C programs and
production. Our empirical analysis suggested that.(1) producers would
respond to the market incentive for C sequestration; (2) producer
responses might be limited, particularly at low C prices; and (3)
producers might perceive differentially a cost for C sequestration,
depending on individual preferences, production attributes, and specific
practices to be adopted. A policy simulation of producer behavior with
agricultural census data estimated the potential C offset supply in the
study area.

N2  - Prepaid monetary incentives are used to address declining response rates
in random-digit dial surveys. There is concern among researchers that
some respondents will accept the prepayment but not complete the survey.
There is little research to understand check cashing and survey
completing behaviors among respondents who receive prepayment. Data from
the International Tobacco Control Four-Country Study-a longitudinal
survey of smokers in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and
Australia-were used to examine the impact of prepayment (in the form of
checks, approximately US$10) on sample profile. Approximately 14
percent of respondents cashed their check, but did not complete the
survey, while about 14 percent did not cash their checks, but completed
the survey. Younger adults (Canada and United States), those of minority
status (United States), and those who had been in the survey for only
two waves or less (Canada and United States) were more likely to cash
their checks and not complete the survey.

N2  - This study aims to compare the effects of incentives and contact modes
on survey completion rates, and examine how non-response rates might
affect the quality of responses in online surveys. Two online surveys
with different incentives and contact modes were conducted. In study 1,
both pre-paid cash incentives and a sweepstakes offering of equal
monetary value were more effective than no incentive but the pre-paid
incentive were more effective than the sweepstakes. In study 2,
respondents who received a pre-paid cash incentive via postal mail after
initially failing to respond to an emailed sweepstakes offer differed
from the initial respondents with respect to demographic and
psychological characteristics previously found to be important in a
widely cited study of social networking. Therefore, non-response error
may indeed be a problem in online surveys, at least among those directed
to college students and using a common method of recruitment in which
offers of sweepstakes drawings are delivered via email. Not only do the
levels of variables important to an understanding of online
communication vary by survey method, but also the lawful relationships
among variables differ between groups recruited by different methods.

N2  - Few studies have employed a controlled experimental design to test the
effectiveness of unconditional cash incentives on the rates of
participation in web surveys. Even fewer studies have looked at the
effects of these incentives on nonresponse bias in web surveys. This
article addresses these two underresearched areas by utilizing two
separate sources of data on a random sample of college students.
Specifically, we examine the impact of prepaid token incentives on
response rates to a web survey and compare survey data on respondents to
administrative records of all sampled persons. Results support the use
of unconditional incentives in web surveys as an effective way to
improve response. However, contrary to several studies on the
relationship between token incentives and nonresponse bias, our findings
suggest that prepaid cash incentives may actually produce data that are
less representative of the target population.

N2  - We analyze survey responses from nearly 600 corporate tax executives to
investigate firms' incentives and disincentives for tax planning. While
many researchers hypothesize that reputational concerns affect the
degree to which managers engage in tax planning, this hypothesis is
difficult to test with archival data. Our survey allows us to
investigate reputational influences and, indeed, we find that
reputational concerns are important-69 percent of executives rate
reputation as important and the factor ranks second in order of
importance among all factors explaining why firms do not adopt a
potential tax planning strategy. We also find that financial accounting
incentives play a role. For example, 84 percent of publicly traded firms
respond that top management at their company cares at least as much
about the GAAP ETR as they do about cash taxes paid and 57 percent of
public firms say that increasing earnings per share is an important
outcome from a tax planning strategy.

N2  - Social stigma, legal sanctions and the associated lack of sampling
frames create barriers to the probabilistic sampling of those engaged in
a variety of behaviour, including illicit drug use. We used a novel
sampling approach to recruit respondents into a longitudinal study
examining amphetamine-type stimulant use. A young adult population was
screened for lifetime drug use to create a sampling frame of
amphetamine-type stimulant users and non-users. We posted 12,118
screening questionnaires to a random selection of young adults listed on
the electoral roll for Brisbane and the Gold Coast, Australia (N
107,275). Using a small pre-paid incentive and intensive telephone and
postal reminders we attained a screening response rate of 49.9%.
Eligible amphetamine-type stimulant users (used ecstasy or
methamphetamine >= 3 times in past 12 months) and non-users (never used
ecstasy or methamphetamine) were identified by screening responses.
About two-thirds of each selected group took part in the longitudinal
study. Comparisons with large-scale population survey data suggest the
sample was broadly representative of young adult amphetamine-type
stimulant users in Australia. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

N2  - IMPORTANCE The impact of the substantial growth in for-profit hospices
in the United States on quality and hospice access has been intensely
debated, yet little is known about how for-profit and nonprofit hospices
differ in activities beyond service delivery.
OBJECTIVE To determine the association between hospice ownership and (1)
provision of community benefits, (2) setting and timing of the hospice
population served, and (3) community outreach.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional survey (the National
Hospice Survey), conducted from September 2008 through November 2009, of
a national random sample of 591 Medicare-certified hospices operating
throughout the United States.
EXPOSURES For-profit or nonprofit hospice ownership.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Provision of community benefits; setting and
timing of the hospice population served; and community outreach.
RESULTS A total of 591 hospices completed our survey (84% response
rate). For-profit hospices were less likely than nonprofit hospices to
provide community benefits including serving as training sites (55% vs
82%; adjusted relative risk {[}ARR], 0.67 {[}95% CI, 0.59-0.76]),
conducting research (18% vs 23%; ARR, 0.67 {[}95% CI, 0.46-0.99]),
and providing charity care (80% vs 82%; ARR, 0.88 {[}95% CI,
0.80-0.96]). For-profit compared with nonprofit hospices cared for a
larger proportion of patients with longer expected hospice stays
including those in nursing homes (30% vs 25%; P =.009). For-profit
hospices were more likely to exceed Medicare's aggregate annual cap
(22% vs 4%; ARR, 3.66 {[}95% CI, 2.02-6.63]) and had a higher patient
disenrollment rate (10% vs 6%; P <.001). For-profit were more likely
than nonprofit hospices to engage in outreach to low-income communities
(61% vs 46%; ARR, 1.23 {[}95% CI, 1.05-1.44]) and minority
communities (59% vs 48%; ARR, 1.18 {[}95% CI, 1.02-1.38]) and less
likely to partner with oncology centers (25% vs 33%; ARR, 0.59 {[}95%
CI, 0.44-0.80]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Ownership-related differences are apparent
among hospices in community benefits, population served, and community
outreach. Although Medicare's aggregate annual cap may curb the
incentive to focus on long-stay hospice patients, additional regulatory
measures such as public reporting of hospice disenrollment rates should
be considered as the share of for-profit hospices in the United States
continues to increase.

N2  - Objectives: Most men diagnosed with prostate cancer become long-term
survivors, but are at risk for medical late-effects that can affect
their long-term health. Mailed surveys are well suited to study
late-effects in this population, but low response rates can compromise
survey validity. This study investigated whether an unconditional $5.00
gift certificate incentive or Priority Mail delivery increased prostate
cancer survivors' response to mailed surveys.
Materials and Methods: 976 participants (mean age = 66.8 years), 2-8
years post-diagnosis, were randomized to one of four groups: Incentive;
Priority Mail; Incentive & Priority Mail; or Control. After an
introductory letter, initial study packets were mailed based on
randomization; 46 days later, a second study packet was mailed to all
non-responders by First-Class Mail.
Results: The first mailing yielded a significant variation in response
rates across groups (chi(2) = 9.34; p = 0.025). Priority Mail (64.7%; p
= 0.008) and Incentive & Priority Mail (63.6%; p = 0.016) groups had
significantly higher response rates than Controls (52.9%). After the
second mailing, the overall response rate increased significantly from
59.6% to 71.4% (p < 0.001); however, response rates no longer differed
across groups (range, 69.3% {[}Incentive group] to 73.9% {[}Priority
Mail group]).
Conclusions: Long-term prostate cancer survivors' response rates to
mailed surveys increased with the use of Priority Mail and a repeat
survey mailing, but the unconditional gift certificate incentive was not
supported in this population. By identifying and applying specialized
survey methods, studies targeting survivors of prostate cancer and other
geriatric cancers may improve response rates, thus limiting a source of
potential bias. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - When communicating with farmers and ranchers, land conservation
professionals would be better equipped if they understood key influences
on their target audience's decisions to permanently preserve their land
from development. This study predicted key factors influencing rancher
engagement in a conservation easement (CE) agreement. Specifically,
theory of planned behavior, trust, environmental identity, past
behavior, perceptions of specific CE characteristics and selected
participant demographics were used as predictors. A mixed-methods
approach was applied involving interviews, a two-phase pilot study, and
a statewide mail-administered questionnaire. Final interview domains
guided the quantitative survey instrument, which was administered to
1,000 Florida cattle ranchers. A 60% response rate was received.
Multiple linear regression demonstrated ranchers were more likely to
enter into a CE agreement if they 1) had a positive attitude about the
outcomes associated with CEs; 2) felt influential others would
positively support CEs; 3) indicated higher trust in conservation
organizations and agencies; 4) believed their land had significant
conservation value; 5) supported sale or donation of certain property
rights; and 6) were positively influenced by financial incentives,
primarily estate tax deductions. These six variables explained over 50%
of intent to engage in a CE agreement. Understanding these influences
will aid land conservationists in their future communication efforts
with farmers and ranchers.

N2  - Despite its theoretical prominence and sound principles, integrated pest
management (IPM) continues to suffer from anemic adoption rates in
developing countries. To shed light on the reasons, we surveyed the
opinions of a large and diverse pool of IPM professionals and
practitioners from 96 countries by using structured concept mapping. The
first phase of this method elicited 413 open-ended responses on
perceived obstacles to IPM. Analysis of responses revealed 51 unique
statements on obstacles, the most frequent of which was ``insufficient
training and technical support to farmers.{''} Cluster analyses, based
on participant opinions, grouped these unique statements into six
themes: research weaknesses, outreach weaknesses, IPM weaknesses, farmer
weaknesses, pesticide industry interference, and weak adoption
incentives. Subsequently, 163 participants rated the obstacles expressed
in the 51 unique statements according to importance and remediation
difficulty. Respondents from developing countries and high-income
countries rated the obstacles differently. As a group,
developing-country respondents rated ``IPM requires collective action
within a farming community{''} as their top obstacle to IPM adoption.
Respondents from high-income countries prioritized instead the
``shortage of well-qualified IPM experts and extensionists.{''}
Differential prioritization was also evident among developing-country
regions, and when obstacle statements were grouped into themes. Results
highlighted the need to improve the participation of stakeholders from
developing countries in the IPM adoption debate, and also to situate the
debate within specific regional contexts.

N2  - Objective: To test the feasibility of implementing a standardized
teamwork training program with full operating room teams in multiple
institutions, driven by malpractice insurer support and incentives.
Background: Failures in intraoperative teamwork are among the leading
causes of preventable patient injury and death in surgical patients.
Teamwork training, particularly using simulation, can be an effective
intervention but is difficult to scale.
Methods: A malpractice insurer convened a collaborative with 4
Harvard-affiliated simulation programs to develop a standardized
operating room teamwork training curriculum, including principles of
communication, assertiveness, and use of the World Health Organization
Surgical Safety Checklist. Participant teams were compensated for lost
operative time via malpractice premium discounts, continuing education
credits, and compensation for lost wages. The course was delivered
through a simulation program involving the management of intraoperative
emergency scenarios. Participants were surveyed for their perceptions of
the program and of its impact on clinical practice.
Results: A total of 221 active operating room staff members participated
in the program. Each team contained at least 1 attending surgeon, 1
attending anesthesiologist, and 1 operating room nurse (mean size per
team: 7 2 participants). No study dates were cancelled because of lack
of attendance. The survey response rate was 99% (218/221). Overall, the
vast majority of participants found the scenarios realistic {[}94%
(95% confidence interval: 90.9%, 97.2%)], appropriately challenging
{[}95.4% (92.6%, 98.2%)], relevant to their practice {[}96.3%
(93.8%, 98.8%)], and found the training would help them provide safer
patient care {[}92.6% (89.1%, 96.1%)]. Surgeons reported their
greatest personal deficit as communication skills. Operating room nurses
and anesthesiologists reported a greater need than surgeons to work on
personal assertiveness.
Conclusions: A standardized multicenter team training program involving
full operative teams is feasible with high-fidelity simulation and
modest compensation for lost time. The vast majority of the
multidisciplinary participants believed the course to have had a
meaningful impact on their approach to clinical practice.

N2  - Background
Recent studies have found that Chinese smokers are relatively
unresponsive to cigarette prices. As the Chinese government contemplates
higher tobacco taxes, it is important to understand the reasons for this
low response. One possible explanation is that smokers buffer themselves
from rising cigarette prices by switching to cheaper cigarette brands.
Objective
This study examines how cigarette prices influence consumers' choices of
cigarette brands in China.
Methods
This study uses panel data from the first three waves of the
International Tobacco Control China Survey, drawn from six large cities
in China and collected between 2006 and 2009. The study sample includes
3477 smokers who are present in at least two waves (8552 person-years).
Cigarette brands are sorted by price into four tiers, using excise tax
categories to determine the cut-off for each tier. The analysis relies
on a conditional logit model to identify the relationship between price
and brand choice.
Findings
Overall, 38% of smokers switched price tiers from one wave to the next.
A yen 1 change in the price of cigarettes alters the tier choice of
4-7% of smokers. Restricting the sample to those who chose each given
tier at baseline, a yen 1 increase in price in a given tier would
decrease the share choosing that tier by 4% for Tier 1 and 1-2% for
Tiers 2 and 3.
Conclusions
China's large price spread across cigarette brands appears to alter the
brand selection of some consumers, especially smokers of cheaper brands.
Tobacco pricing and tax policy can influence consumers' incentives to
switch brands. In particular, whereas ad valorem taxes in a tiered
pricing system like China's encourage trading down, specific excise
taxes discourage the practice.

N2  - We examined the local community incentive programs to improve
traditional forest management in three forested villages in Baneh city,
Kurdistan province in the northern Zagros forests of western Iran.
Zagros forests cover 6.07 million ha and support rich plant and animal
diversity. Changes in local community social and economic systems and
the inefficiency of traditional forest management led to a critical
situation in the stability of forest regeneration in recent decades. Due
to a shortage of productive and arable lands and resulting unemployment
and poverty, people overexploited the Zagros forests. Outside
intervention in traditional forest management creates conflicts between
local peoples and forest management organizations. To achieve
sustainable forest management, including forest resources conservation
and improvement of natural resource based livelihoods of communities, it
is desirable to implement Forestry Incentive Programs (FIP) based on the
important functions of forests. Detailed information on the
socio-economics of communities, the effect of forests on local
livelihoods, and lists of products extracted from the forest were
obtained from a survey of local communities though questionnaire,
interview and observation. We studied 276 households in three villages
and completed 76 questionnaires by householders in the quantitative
analysis. Sampling was performed by simple random sampling (SRS). The
needs of rural communities, such as livestock husbandry, mainly arise
from the characteristics and environmental features of villages. We
identified the driving forces, pressures, status, impacts and responses
(DPSIR) to design incentive programs, by DPSIR analysis and interaction
analysis. Evaluation of local community benefits from forests showed
that in order to improve forest management, 319 dollars per year would
be needed by each family as an incentive in 2010 to prevent lopping and
firewood collecting, the main causes of forest degradation.

N2  - IntroductionProjected shortages in the primary care workforce underlie a
need for more women's health care providers. In order to prepare more
midwives to address this deficit, educators require additional clinical
placement sites for students. The purpose of this study was to determine
factors that influence practicing midwives to serve as preceptors.
MethodsAn e-mail invitation to participate in an online survey was sent
to 7658 current and lapsed members of the American College of Nurse-
Midwives (ACNM), who provided ACNM with a valid e-mail address. The
survey assessed factors that enabled or were barriers for midwifery
preceptors. Forced-choice questions were analyzed using descriptive
statistics. Participant comments were analyzed using qualitative
descriptive methods.
ResultsThere were a total of 1517 surveys completed, for a response rate
of 19.8%. Participants were primarily certified nurse-midwives (96.0%)
who were in clinical practice (83.9%), with 78.0% in full-scope
clinical practice. Participants represented all geographic regions of
the United States. The majority of the participants indicated they or
someone in their practice could precept a midwifery student. A
commitment to the midwifery profession was the most commonly identified
motivating factor (58.5%). Larger practices were more likely to precept
midwifery students and to accept more than one student at a time. The
most frequently identified barrier to precepting was the need to
maintain a high patient volume (6.9%). Write-in comments were provided
by approximately 500 participants and coded into 9 themes: payment,
barriers to precepting, incentives, student characteristics, mechanisms
for placement, communication, giving back, preceptor qualifications, and
professional issues.
DiscussionThere is a strong commitment from preceptors to give back to
the profession through the teaching of the future generation of
midwives. Many of the barriers to precepting could be addressed by ACNM,
the Accreditation Commission for Midwifery Education, and individual
midwifery education programs.

N2  - Researchers, using contingent valuation (CV) to value changes in
nonmarket goods, typically believe respondents always answer questions
truthfully or they answer truthfully only when it is in their interest
to do so. The second position, while consistent with economic theory,
implies that interpreting survey responses depends critically on the
incentive structure provided. We derive simple tests capable of
distinguishing the two views. Our theoretical model for examining the
incentive structure of a single binary choice relaxes the usual expected
utility assumption. We test our theory using a field experiment
involving voting to provide a public good. Experimental results are
consistent theoretical predictions and cast doubt on the relevance of a
large experimental literature using inconsequential questions and
non-incentive-compatible mechanisms to make inferences about CV. The
framework put forth should help in understanding the role played by
theoretical conditions for preference elicitation and lend insight into
the hypothetical bias literature.

N2  - Background: There is extensive evidence that regular physical activity
confers numerous health benefits. Despite this, high rates of physical
inactivity prevail among older adults. This study aimed to ascertain if
incentives could be effective in motivating physical activity through
improving uptake of walking programs, either with or without an
enrolment fee to cover corresponding costs.
Methods: A discrete-choice conjoint survey was fielded to a national
sample of older adults in Singapore. Each respondent was given ten pairs
of hypothetical walking programs and asked to choose the option they
preferred. Each option varied along several dimensions, including the
level and type (cash, voucher, or health savings credit) of incentive
and an enrolment fee. For each option, they were asked how likely they
would be to join their preferred program. A random utility model (RUM)
was used to analyze the responses.
Results: Results suggest that a free 6-month program with a $500 cash
incentive would generate enrolment rates of 58.5%; charging $50 to
enroll lowers this to 55.7%. In terms of incentive type, cash payments
were the most preferred incentive but not significantly different from
supermarket vouchers. Both were preferred to health savings credits and
sporting goods vouchers. Concerns of adverse selection were minimal
because those who were inactive represented at least 72% of new
participants for any offered program(s) and were the majority.
Conclusions: Study results demonstrate the potential for even modest
incentives to increase program uptake among inactive older adults.
Moreover, although cash was the most preferred option, supermarket
vouchers, which could potentially be purchased at a discount, were a
close alternative. Results also suggest that an enrolment fee is a
viable option to offset the costs of incentives as it has only minimal
impact on participation.

N2  - Surveys can increase market transparency when information asymmetries
are present-but this will only happen when respondents answer questions
truthfully. Sometimes, however, it might not be in the respondents' best
interest to provide truthful information on their firm or market. This
will be especially true when other firms can exploit any information
they provide. Understanding when, and under what conditions, respondents
answer questions truthfully is important to researchers studying these
markets and to policymakers using firm surveys to identify ways of
improving the business environment. Using data from two countries in
South Asia, this paper uses a random response technique to identify
respondents that do not answer truthfully. We label these respondents as
`reticent'. We show that respondents become more reticent when their
firms face intense price competition. We argue that this is because
intense competition gives respondents a greater incentive to misreport
information to reduce market transparency.

N2  - We report evidence from a large field experiment that compares the
effectiveness of contingent and noncontingent incentives in eliciting
costly effort for a large range of payment levels. The company with
which we worked sent 7,250 letters asking customers to complete a
survey. Some letters promised to pay amounts ranging from $1 to $30
upon compliance (contingent incentives), whereas others already
contained the money in the request envelopes (noncontingent incentives).
Compared to no payment, very small contingent payments lower the
response rate while small noncontingent payments raise the response
rate. As expected, response rates rise with the size of the incentive
offered. The response rate in the noncontingent incentives rises more
rapidly for low amounts of incentive, but then flattens out and reaches
lower levels than under contingent payments. We discuss how the optimal
policy regarding the use of each size and type of incentives crucially
depends on firms' objectives.

N2  - Background: As adoption and use of electronic health records (EHRs)
grows in the United States, there is a growing need in the field of
applied clinical informatics to evaluate physician perceptions and
beliefs about the impact of EHRs. The meaningful use of EHR incentive
program provides a suitable context to examine physician beliefs about
the impact of EHRs.
Objective: Contribute to the sparse literature on physician beliefs
about the impact of EHRs in areas such as quality of care, effectiveness
of care, and delivery of care.
Methods: A cross-sectional online survey of physicians at two academic
medical centers (AMCs) in the northeast who were preparing to qualify
for the meaningful use of EHR incentive program.
Results: Of the 1,797 physicians at both AMCs who were preparing to
qualify for the incentive program, 967 completed the survey for an
overall response rate of 54%. Only 23% and 27% of physicians agreed
or strongly agreed that meaningful use of the EHR will help them improve
the care they personally deliver and improve quality of care
respectively. Physician specialty was significantly associated with
beliefs; e. g., 35% of primary care physicians agreed or strongly
agreed that meaningful use will improve quality of care compared to 26%
of medical specialists and 21% of surgical specialists (p=0.009).
Satisfaction with outpatient EHR was also significantly related to all
belief items.
Conclusions: Only about a quarter of physicians in our study responded
positively that meaningful use of the EHR will improve quality of care
and the care they personally provide. These findings are similar to and
extend findings from qualitative studies about negative perceptions that
physicians hold about the impact of EHRs. Factors outside of the
regulatory context, such as physician beliefs, need to be considered in
the implementation of the meaningful use of the EHR incentive program.

N2  - Background: Median indebtedness at graduation is now more than $170,000
for graduates of US Medical Schools. Debate still exists as to whether
higher debt levels influence students to choose high paying non-primary
care specialties. Notably, no previous research on the topic has taken
into account cost of attendance when constructing a debt model, nor has
any research examined the non-career major life decisions that medical
students face.
Methods: Medical students were surveyed using an anonymous electronic
instrument developed for this study. The survey was delivered through a
link included in a study email and students were recruited from school
wide listservs and through snowball sampling (students were encouraged
to share a link to the survey with other medical students). No
incentives were offered for survey completion.
Results: Responses were recorded from 102 US Allopathic medical schools
(n = 3,032), with 22 institutions (11 public, 11 private) meeting
inclusion criteria of 10% student body response proportion (n = 1,846).
Students with higher debt relative to their peers at their home
institution reported higher frequencies of feeling callous towards
others, were more likely to choose a specialty with a higher average
annual income, were less likely to plan to practice in underserved
locations, and were less likely to choose primary care specialties.
Students with higher aggregate amounts of medical student loan debt were
more likely to report high levels of stress from their educational debt,
to delay getting married and to report disagreement that they would
choose to become a physician again, if given the opportunity to revisit
that choice. Increases in both aggregate and relative debt were
associated with delaying having children, delaying buying a house,
concerns about managing and paying back educational debt, and worrying
that educational debt will influence one's specialty choice.
Conclusions: Medical student debt and particularly debt relative to
peers at the same institution appears to influence the way that students
approach major life choices like when to start a family, when to buy a
home, and what specialty to choose. Future research should take into
account cost of attendance when looking for the impact of medical
student debt on major life choices.

N2  - Private auditing is a significant component of food safety regulation.
Typically, manufacturers, retail sellers, and food-service operators
require their suppliers to obtain food safety certification from a
private third-party auditor paid by the supplier. Auditors' financial
interest in acquiring accounts from suppliers who want the cheapest
certification that they can obtain gives auditors incentive to reduce
the rigor of audits. This constitutes a conflict of interest between the
auditor's private financial interest and its professional obligation to
protect the public from food safety risks. Audit industry insiders and
outside observers are well aware of this problem, and various
institutional actors both public and private have developed oversight
mechanisms to address it.
We analyze the nature and sources of this conflict of interest in food
safety auditing, efforts to prevent it, and responses when it occurs.
Our focus is on institutional design organizational structures,
administrative routines, and professional norms. Part I of the Article
describes how conflicts of interest lead some auditors to be less
probing in their inspection of suppliers' operations and to skew their
risk evaluations in favor of suppliers' desire for cheap certification.
Part II of the Article surveys the different oversight mechanisms
currently in place or under development that aim to counteract auditors'
incentive to reduce the rigor of audits.
Conflict of interest is a structural feature of any system of private
standards compliance in which the auditor is paid by the entity being
audited. Other prominent examples include securities rating and
environmental audits. Our analysis of food safety auditing aims to offer
general insights into the comparative strengths and weaknesses of
different responses to this problem.

N2  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study the re-entry to the
workforce of fully retired persons (unretirement) and whether the
decision to resume work depends primarily on social or economic reasons.
Design/methodology/approach - Using Swedish register data for already
retired individuals older than 55, the incidence of unretirement is
studied. Determinant factors behind the decision to re-enter the labor
force is analyzed in a binary response logit model.
Findings - Unretirement varies between 6 and 14 percent under two
different definitions. We find support for higher pension income to
decrease the probability to unretire. Other determinants, such as
marital status, largely support an interpretation that unretirement is a
life-style decision rather than a response to an experienced negative
economic situation post retirement.
Research limitations/implications - Due to data limitations, the focus
in this study is on the extensive margin (the event of returning to the
labor force) and not on hours of work post re-entry.
Social implications - If older persons that are physically able to work
also want to work and succeed in finding work when they demand so,
unretirement is welfare enhancing. However, if unretirement is an effect
of unexpected realizations post retirement, any increase in the number
of persons facing such unexpected shocks implies an increase in the
uncertainty of life as retired.
Originality/value - Research on unretirement is scarce and has
previously been performed exclusively on US survey data. Knowing the
determinants of unretirement is important to know if and how incentives
to unretire should be designed.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Accountable care organizations (ACOs) have the potential to
lower costs and improve quality through incentives and coordinated care.
However, the design brings with it many new challenges. One such
challenge is the optimal use of pharmaceuticals. Most ACOs have not yet
focused on this integral facet of care, even though medications are a
critical component to achieving the lower costs and Improved quality
that are anticipated with this new model.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether ACOs are prepared to maximize the value
of medications for achieving quality benchmarks and cost offsets.
METHODS: During the fall of 2012, an electronic readiness
self-assessment was developed using a portion of the questions and
question methodology from the National Survey of Accountable Care
Organizations, along with original questions developed by the authors.
The assessment was tested and subsequently revised based on feedback
from pilot testing with 5 ACO representatives. The revised assessment
was distributed via e-mail to a convenience sample (n=175) of ACO
members of the American Medical Group Association, Brookings-Dartmouth
ACO Learning Network, and Premier Healthcare Alliance.
RESULTS: The self-assessment was completed by 46 ACO representatives
(26% response rate). ACOs reported high readiness to manage medications
In a few areas, such as transmitting prescriptions electronically
(70%), being able to integrate medical and pharmacy data into a single
database (54%), and having a formulary in place that encourages generic
use when appropriate (50%). However, many areas have substantial room
for improvement with few ACOs reporting high readiness. Some notable
areas include being able to quantify the cost offsets and hence
demonstrate the value of appropriate medication use (7%), notifying a
physician when a prescription has been filled (9%), having protocols in
place to avoid medication duplication and polypharmacy (17%), and
having quality metrics in place for a broad diversity of conditions
(22%).
CONCLUSIONS: Developing the capabilities to support, monitor, and ensure
appropriate medication use will be critical to achieve optimal patient
outcomes and ACO success. The ACOs surveyed have embarked upon an
important journey towards this goal, but critical gaps remain before
they can become fully accountable. While many of these organizations
have begun adopting health information technologies that allow them to
maximize the value of medications for achieving quality outcomes and
cost offsets, a significant lag was identified in their inability to use
these technologies to their full capacities. In order to provide further
guidance, the authors have begun documenting case studies for public
release that would provide ACOs with examples of how certain medication
issues have been addressed by ACOs or relevant organizations. The
authors hope that these case studies will help ACOs optimize the value
of pharmaceuticals and achieve the ``triple aim{''} of improving care,
health, and cost. Copyright (C) 2014, Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy.

N2  - The research presented here provides some descriptive information of
nursing home pay for performance (P4P) initiatives and an examination of
the opinions of nursing home administrators (NHAs) about P4P. Opinions
on three common elements of P4P were examined: the incentive format,
program format, and quality format. Information came from a mail survey
of 2,426 NHAs. Most of the summary scores show that few NHAs gave
positive responses to P4P. Very few NHAs believed that P4P would
increase their revenues. NHAs were skeptical that P4P systems were for
quality improvement and instead believed they were developed for
purposes of cost reduction. Relatively few NHAs believed that P4P would
improve quality of care. Given that we have limited experience with
setting performance goals and incentive formats for NHAs, the findings
presented may prove useful in modeling future P4P systems.

N2  - Objective To quantify the effect of strategies to improve retention in
randomised trials.
Design Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Data sources Sources searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, DARE, CENTRAL,
CINAHL, C2-SPECTR, ERIC, PreMEDLINE, Cochrane Methodology Register,
Current Controlled Trials metaRegister, WHO trials platform, Society for
Clinical Trials (SCT) conference proceedings and a survey of all UK
clinical trial research units.
Review methods Included trials were randomised evaluations of strategies
to improve retention embedded within host randomised trials. The primary
outcome was retention of trial participants. Data from trials were
pooled using the fixed-effect model. Subgroup analyses were used to
explore the heterogeneity and to determine whether there were any
differences in effect by the type of strategy.
Results 38 retention trials were identified. Six broad types of
strategies were evaluated. Strategies that increased postal
questionnaire responses were: adding, that is, giving a monetary
incentive (RR 1.18; 95% CI 1.09 to 1.28) and higher valued incentives
(RR 1.12; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.22). Offering a monetary incentive, that is,
an incentive given on receipt of a completed questionnaire, also
increased electronic questionnaire response (RR 1.25; 95% CI 1.14 to
1.38). The evidence for shorter questionnaires (RR 1.04; 95% CI 1.00 to
1.08) and questionnaires relevant to the disease/condition (RR 1.07;
95% CI 1.01 to 1.14) is less clear. On the basis of the results of
single trials, the following strategies appeared effective at increasing
questionnaire response: recorded delivery of questionnaires (RR 2.08;
95% CI 1.11 to 3.87); a package' of postal communication strategies (RR
1.43; 95% CI 1.22 to 1.67) and an open trial design (RR 1.37; 95% CI
1.16 to 1.63). There is no good evidence that the following strategies
impact on trial response/retention: adding a non-monetary incentive
(RR=1.00; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.02); offering a non-monetary incentive
(RR=0.99; 95% CI 0.95 to 1.03); enhanced' letters (RR=1.01; 95% CI
0.97 to 1.05); monetary incentives compared with offering prize draw
entry (RR=1.04; 95% CI 0.91 to 1.19); priority postal delivery
(RR=1.02; 95% CI 0.95 to 1.09); behavioural motivational strategies
(RR=1.08; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.24); additional reminders to participants
(RR=1.03; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.06) and questionnaire question order
(RR=1.00, 0.97 to 1.02). Also based on single trials, these strategies
do not appear effective: a telephone survey compared with a monetary
incentive plus questionnaire (RR=1.08; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.24); offering a
charity donation (RR=1.02, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.32); sending sites
reminders (RR=0.96; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.11); sending questionnaires early
(RR=1.10; 95% CI 0.96 to 1.26); longer and clearer questionnaires
(RR=1.01, 0.95 to 1.07) and participant case management by trial
assistants (RR=1.00; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.04).
Conclusions Most of the trials evaluated questionnaire response rather
than ways to improve participants return to site for follow-up. Monetary
incentives and offers of monetary incentives increase postal and
electronic questionnaire response. Some strategies need further
evaluation. Application of these results would depend on trial context
and follow-up procedures.

N2  - In response to substantial deforestation over many decades, large scale
reforestation programs are being implemented across many tropical
developing countries. Examples include the United Nations Billion Trees
Campaign, the National Greening Program in the Philippines, and the 5
million ha reforestation program in Vietnam. However, while substantial
investments are being made in reforestation, little information exists
on the drivers influencing reforestation success and how these interact
to determine environmental and socio-economic outcomes. In this study we
surveyed 43 reforestation projects on Leyte Island, The Philippines to
identify the drivers that most influence reforestation success as
measured by key indicators drawn from the literature, including
interactions between drivers and between drivers and indicators. We
investigated 98 potential success drivers, including technical and
biophysical factors; socio-economic factors; institutional, policy and
management factors; and reforestation project characteristics. We also
measured 12 success indicators, including forest establishment, forest
growth, environmental and socio-economic success indicators. Stepwise
multiple regressions were used to identify significant relationships
among drivers and indicators and this analysis was used to develop a
system of driver and indicator relationships. Based on this we found
that revegetation method, funding source, education and awareness
campaigns, the dependence of local people on forests, reforestation
incentives, project objectives, forest protection mechanisms and the
condition of road infrastructure were highly connected drivers that
influenced multiple success indicators either directly or indirectly. We
conclude that policies targeting revegetation methods, socioeconomic
incentives, forest protection mechanisms, sustainable livelihoods,
diversification of funding and partnerships, technical support, and
infrastructure development are likely to have a broad systemic and
beneficial effect on the success of reforestation programs in tropical
developing countries. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Purpose - A survey of students in different undergraduate majors and
years asked where they bought their textbooks, the types of electronic
devices they used, and their post-class use of textbook material. The
research goal was to determine the groups of students likely most
receptive to e-textbooks and to assess the potential environmental
benefits of e-textbook adoption. The paper aims to discuss these issues.
Design/methodology/approach - The student population of freshmen and
juniors registered at Michigan State University were surveyed via
e-mail/online in summer 2010. 477 freshmen (7.8 percent of surveyed) and
652 juniors (10.2 percent of surveyed) responded. Responses were grouped
together into seven categories by student major.
Findings - Surveyed students used far more print textbooks than
e-textbooks. Laptops were the dominant student device and their future
promise for e-textbook use is limited. The higher-than-expected rate of
e-waste generation by students indicates that the environmental benefits
of e-textbook adoption may be limited without improvements in e-waste
management. However, results suggest that students from all majors and
years were willing to experiment with different textbook vendors, so if
functionality and cost incentives are improved, e-textbook adoption will
likely be a widespread campus phenomenon.
Originality/value - Research on e-textbooks often focuses on educational
value or student preference; this research instead provides results
assessing whether current e-device use on campus will support
e-textbooks and whether adopting e-textbooks will have an environmental
benefit over print textbooks. The study also reveals that many students
learn to adapt their purchasing behavior with experience, and that this
trend is widespread throughout all majors.

(i. e., provide energy balance care). We assessed the organization of
PCPs' practices for providing this care.
Design. The study design was a nationally representative survey
conducted in 2008.
Setting. The study setting was U. S. primary care practices.
Subjects. A total of 1740 PCPs completed two sequential questionnaires
(response rate, 55.5%).
Measures. The study measured PCPs' reports of practice resources, and
the frequency of body mass index assessment, counseling, referral for
further evaluation/management, and monitoring of patients for energy
balance care.
Analysis. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression modeling were
used.
Results. More than 80% of PCPs reported having information resources on
diet, physical activity, or weight control available in waiting/exam
rooms, but fewer billed (45%), used reminder systems (, 30%), or
received incentive payments (3%) for energy balance care. A total of
26% reported regularly assessing body mass index and always/often
providing counseling as well as tracking patients for progress related
to energy balance. In multivariate analyses, PCPs in practices with full
electronic health records or those that bill for energy balance care
provided this care more often and more comprehensively. There were
strong specialty differences, with pediatricians more likely (odds
ratio, 1.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.262.51) and
obstetrician/gynecologists less likely (odds ratio, 0.28; 95%
confidence interval, 0.17-0.44) than others to provide energy balance
care.
nce care. Further research is needed to understand PCP care-related
specialty differences.

N2  - Introduction: The importance of tobacco tax structure in determining the
relative prices of different tobacco products and brands has become
increasingly recognized. The structuring of tobacco tax across products
and brands within a country can impact the variability of prices within
a country, shaping consumption and influencing tobacco users' incentives
to switch down to cheaper alternatives in response to tax and price
increases.
Methods: Brand-specific data on the average prices paid for the top 5
cigarette brands in 13 countries were obtained from the Global Adult
Tobacco Survey, and for the United States, data were obtained from the
National Adult Tobacco Survey. The variability of cigarette prices paid
across brands was analyzed in the context of each country's tobacco tax
structure.
Results: Countries with simpler cigarette tax structures, particularly
those that emphasize specific taxes and do not involve tier-based taxes,
exhibit less variability in the prices smokers pay for cigarettes across
brands.
Conclusions: Increases in cigarette taxes in countries with simpler tax
structures will be more effective in reducing cigarette smoking and its
health and economic consequences than comparable tax increases in
countries where tax structures are more complicated and there are
greater opportunities for switching to cheaper brands in order to avoid
a tax increase.

N2  - This paper considers how farmers perceive and respond to climate change
policy risks, and suggests that understanding these risk responses is as
important as understanding responses to biophysical climate change
impacts. Based on a survey of 162 farmers in California, we test three
hypotheses regarding climate policy risk: (1) that perceived climate
change risks will have a direct impact on farmer's responses to climate
policy risks, (2) that previous climate change experiences will
influence farmer's climate change perceptions and climate policy risk
responses, and (3) that past experiences with environmental policies
will more strongly affect a farmer's climate change beliefs, risks, and
climate policy risk responses. Using a structural equation model we find
support for all three hypotheses and furthermore show that farmers'
negative past policy experiences do not make them less likely to respond
to climate policy risks through participation in a government incentive
program. We discuss how future research and climate policies can be
structured to garner greater agricultural participation. This work
highlights that understanding climate policy risk responses and other
social, economic and policy perspectives is a vital component of
understanding climate change beliefs, risks and behaviors and should be
more thoroughly considered in future work. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

undergraduate family medicine research education in 20 of the 25 member
countries, and in 10 countries students were required to do research
projects. Postgraduate family medicine research was reported by 18 of
the member countries. Open-ended responses showed that EGPRN meetings
promoted stimulating and interesting research questions such as
comparative studies of chronic pain management, sleep disorders, elderly
care, healthy lifestyle promotion, mental health, clinical competence,
and appropriateness of specialist referrals. Many respondents reported a
lack of interest in family medicine research related to poor incentives
and low family medicine status in general and among medical students in
particular. It was suggested that EGPRN exert political lobbying for
family medicine research. Conclusion. Since 1974, EGPRN organizes
biannual conferences that unite and promote primary care practice,

N2  - In response to the decline of northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus;
hereafter, bobwhite) in eastern Oklahoma, USA, a cost-share incentive
program for private landowners was initiated to restore early
successional habitat. Our objectives were to determine whether the
program had an effect on bobwhite occupancy in the restoration areas and
evaluate how local-and landscape-level habitat characteristics affect
occupancy in both restoration and control areas. We surveyed 14 sample
units that received treatment between 2009 and 2011, and 17 sample units
that were controls. We used single-season occupancy models, with year as
a dummy variable, to test for an effect of restoration treatment and
habitat variables on occupancy. We found no significant treatment
effect. Model selection showed that occupancy was best explained by the
combination of overstory canopy cover and habitat area at both the local
and landscape scales. Moran's I revealed positive spatial
autocorrelation in the 1,000-3,000-m distance band, indicating that the
likelihood of bobwhite occupancy increased with proximity to other
populations. We show that creating >= 20 ha of habitat within 1-3 km of
existing bobwhite populations increases the chance of restoration being
successful. Published 2013. This article is a U.S. Government work and

N2  - Objective: Very little is known about predictors of response rates to
long-term follow-up mail-out surveys, including whether the timing of an
incentive affects response rates. We aimed to determine whether the
timing of the incentive affects response rates and what baseline
demographic and psychological factors predict response rates to a 12
year follow-up survey.
Study design and setting: Participants were 450 randomly selected people
from the Penrith population, Australia who had previously participated
in a mail-out survey 12 years earlier. By random allocation, 150 people
received no incentive, 150 received a lottery ticket inducement with the
follow-up survey and 150 received a lottery ticket inducement on the
return of a completed survey.
Results: The overall response rate for the study was 63%. There were no
significant differences in terms of response rates between the no
incentive (58.8%; 95% CI 49.8%, 67.3%), incentive with survey
(65.1%; 95% CI 56.2%, 73.3%) and promised incentive (65.3%; 95% CI
56.1%, 73.7%) groups. Independent predictors of responding to the 12
year survey were being older (OR=1.02, 95% CI 1.01, 1.05, P=0.001) and
being less neurotic as reported on the first survey 12 years earlier
(OR=0.92, 95% CI 0.86,0.98, P=0.010).
Conclusions: Psychological factors may play a role in determining who
responds to long-term follow-up surveys although timing of incentives
does not.

N2  - This paper examines the role of Australian hot water system rebate
programs in shifting the existing stock of electric water heaters toward
more climate friendly versions using two unique data sets from New South
Wales homeowners. The first data set is based on a survey of households
who recently purchased a water heater before and after the rebate
programs were in place. The other is based on a set of stated preference
questions asked of households soon to face a replacement decision. While
the former allows us to look at recent responses, the latter enables us
to forecast future demand. We find that the programs significantly
increase shares of solar/heat pump systems. The programs, however,
appear less effective in reducing the stock of electric heaters for
households with access to natural gas. This pattern is consistent in
both datasets. Results from the discrete choice experiments suggest
considerable heterogeneity with respect to household preferences toward
different types of water heaters and the discount rates they hold. The
effective cost of reducing carbon emissions via incentives for water
heater replacement is considered from the counterfactual perspective of
no government incentives. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Partnerships have a long history in federal land management,
particularly related to trail maintenance and habitat management;
however, increasingly constrained appropriations and greater public
demand have elevated the agency's use of partnerships from an
alternative management strategy to a critical component of task
accomplishment. Despite the growing reliance on partnerships to meet
management goals, few systematic partnership studies exist. This paper
presents survey data collected from agency personnel on 13 national
forests identified using stratified random sampling. Results from 611
respondents (40% response rate) illustrate that agency leaders strongly
encourage partnerships and partnership reliance has substantially
increased over the past 5 years. While partnerships are widely
encouraged, few incentives or rewards for employees' partnership work
were reported. The study has implications for future partnership
development and draws attention to both the need for finding an
appropriate balance of partner reliance and the importance of internal
support and recognition.

N2  - Women represent a growing proportion of the physician workforce,
worldwide. Therefore, for the purposes of workforce planning, it is
increasingly important to understand differences in how male and female
physicians work and might respond to financial incentives. A recent
survey allowed us to determine whether sex-based differences in either
physician income or responses to a hypothetical increase in
reimbursement exist among French General Practitioners (GPs). Our
analysis of 828 male and 244 female GPs' responses showed that females
earned 35% less per year from medical practice than their male
counterparts. After adjusting for the fact that female GPs had practiced
medicine fewer years, worked 11% fewer hours per year, and spent more
time with each consultation, female GPs earned 11,194(sic), or 20.6%,
less per year (95% CI: 7085(sic)-15,302(sic) less per year). Male GPs
were more likely than female GPs to indicate that they would work fewer
hours if consultation fees were to be increased. Our findings suggest
that, as the feminization of medicine increases, the need to address
gender-based income disparities increases and the tools that French
policymakers use to regulate the physician supply might need to change.

N2  - The prevalence of energy resources on American Indian lands, the links
between energy management and tribal sovereignty, and recent federal
government incentives make tribal energy planning an interesting case
study for community energy planning in the US. This paper studies the
strategic energy planning efforts, energy resource development, and
energy efficiency policies established by tribes within the continental
US. The paper analyzes the results of a survey of various tribes' energy
resource development and planning efforts and supplements the responses
with publicly available information on resources, economics, and
demographics. We find that incentives and advisory services from the
federal government are key to developing the capacity of the tribes to
pursue energy planning and energy resource development. These incentives
largely avoid the misdeeds of past federal policy by promoting tribal
control over energy planning and energy resource development efforts.
Tribes with formal energy plans or visions are more likely to develop
energy resources than tribes without them and are engaged in a more
comprehensive and sustainable approach to energy resource development
and energy efficiency. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - The methods used to select public officials affect the preferences they
bring to office, the incentives they face while in office, and,
ultimately, the policy goals they pursue. We argue that the preferences
and actions of local election officials (LEOs) differ depending on
whether they are elected or appointed. We test these expectations with a
data set that includes the survey responses of 1,200 Wisconsin LEOs,
structured interviews, census data, and returns from the 2008
presidential election. Drawing upon a natural experiment in how
officials are selected, we find that, compared to appointed officials,
elected officials express greater support for voter access and
expressless concern about ballot security and administrative costs. For
appointed officials, we find that voter turnout in a municipality is
lower when the LEO's self-reported partisanship differs from the
partisanship of the electorate but only in cases where the official is a
Republican.

N2  - Objectives: To assess clinician attitudes and experiences in Health
eHearts, a quality recognition and financial incentive program using
health information technology.
Study Design: Survey of physicians.
Methods: A survey was administered to 140 lead clinicians at each
participating practice. Survey domains included clinicians' experiences
and attitudes toward the selected clinical quality measures focused on
cardiovascular care, use of electronic health records (EHRs), technical
assistance visits, quality measurement reports, and incentive payments.
Responses were compared across groups of practices receiving financial
incentives with those in the control (no financial rewards).
Results: Survey response rate was 74%. The majority of respondents
reported receiving and reviewing the quality reports (89%), agreed with
the prioritization of measures (89%), and understood the information
given in the quality reports (95%). Over half of the respondents had a
quality improvement visit (56%), with incentive clinicians more likely
to have had a visit compared with the control group (68% vs 43%,
P=.01). The incentive group respondents (92%) were more likely to
report using clinical decision support system alerts than control group
respondents (82%, P=.11).
Conclusions: Clinicians in both incentive and control groups reported
positive experiences with the program. No differences were detected
between groups regarding agreement with selected clinical measures or
their relevance to the patient population. However, clinicians in the
incentive group were more likely to review quarterly performance reports
and access quality improvement visits. Incentives may be used to further
engage clinicians operating in small independently owned practices to
participate in quality improvement activities.

N2  - The meetings, incentives, conventions, and exhibitions (MICE) industry
has evolved into a vital sector of business tourism. The vast majority
of research to date has focused on the convention/meeting sector, with
studies on convention site selection being especially prominent. In
contrast, the exhibition sector and particularly, exhibition destination
attractiveness, have received relatively little research attention. This
study aims to address this research gap by examining, from the
exhibitors' perspective, key factors for an attractive and successful
exhibition destination. Based on 616 survey responses from exhibitors
collected at nine trade fairs in four cities in Mainland China, study
findings highlighted the critical importance of two types of cluster
effectshost city leadership in the industry and host city/region as a
source of exhibitorsto an exhibition destination's attractiveness for
exhibitors. Accessibility, venue facilities, and the destination's
leisure and economic environment were considered less important.
Implications of the study results are discussed and directions for
future research provided.

N2  - Understanding how institutional incentives and mechanisms for assigning
recognition shape access to a permanent job is important. This study,
based on data from questionnaire survey responses and publications of
1,257 university science, biomedical and engineering faculty in Spain,
attempts to understand the timing of getting a permanent position and
the relevant factors that account for this transition, in the context of
dilemmas between mobility and permanence faced by organizations. Using
event history analysis, the paper looks at the time to promotion and the
effects of some relevant covariates associated to academic performance,
social embeddedness and mobility. We find that research productivity
contributes to career acceleration, but that other variables are also
significantly associated to a faster transition. Factors associated to
the social elements of academic life also play a role in reducing the
time from PhD graduation to tenure. However, mobility significantly
increases the duration of the non-tenure stage. In contrast with
previous findings, the role of sex is minor. The variations in the
length of time to promotion across different scientific domains is
confirmed, with faster career advancement for those in the Engineering
and Technological Sciences compared with academics in the Biological and
Biomedical Sciences. Results show clear effects of seniority, and
rewards to loyalty, in addition to some measurements of performance and
quality of the university granting the PhD, as key elements speeding up
career advancement. Findings suggest the existence of a system based on
granting early permanent jobs to those that combine social embeddedness
and team integration with some good credentials regarding past and
potential future performance, rather than high levels of mobility.

N2  - Background: The setting of realistic performance-based financing rewards
necessitates not just knowledge of health workers' salaries, but of the
revenue that accrues from their additional income-generating activities.
This study examined the coping mechanisms of health workers in the
public health sector of Nasarawa and Ondo states in Nigeria to
supplement their salaries and benefits; it also estimated the
proportionate value of the revenues from those coping mechanisms in
relation to the health workers' official incomes.
Methods: This study adopted a mixed-methods approach, consisting of
semi-structured interviews, a review of policy documents, a survey using
self-administered questionnaires, and the randomized response technique
(RRT). In all, 170 health workers (86 in Ondo, 84 in Nasarawa)
participated in the survey. In-depth interviews were conducted with 24
health workers (12 per state) and nine policy makers from both states.
Results: The health workers perceived their salaries as inadequate,
though most policy makers differed in this assessment. There appeared to
be a considerable expenditure-income disparity among the respondents.
Approximately 56% (n = 93) of the study population reported having
additional earning arrangements: most reported non-medical activities
such as farming and trading, but private practice was also frequently
reported. Half of the respondents with additional earning arrangements
stated that their income from those activities was the equivalent of
half or more of their monthly salaries. Specifically, 35% (n = 32) said
that they earned about half of their official monthly salaries and 15%
(n = 14) reported earning the same or more than their monthly salaries
from these activities. Other coping mechanisms used by the health
workers included prioritizing activities that enabled the earning of per
diems, collecting informal payments and gifts from patients, and
pilfering drugs from facilities.
Conclusions: Predatory and non-predatory mechanisms accounted for the
health workers' additional income. It may be difficult for the health
workers to meet their expenses with their salaries and financial
incentives; this highlights the need for the regulation of additional
earnings and to implement targeted accountability mechanisms. This study
indicates the value of using mixed methods when investigating sensitive
issues. Future studies of this type should employ mixed methods for
triangulation purposes to provide better insight into health workers'
responses.

N2  - Objectives: The huge population basic and the transformational changes
to healthcare system in China have gained wide public attention in
recent years. Along with these issues is a growing literature about
doctor's job satisfaction; however, more is known about its negative
related factors. Thus, this study was an attempt to assess the level of
job satisfaction among Chinese doctors and to explore factors that
enhance their job satisfaction.
Study design: Cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey.
Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted during the period of
September/October 2010. A questionnaire containing job satisfaction
assessed by Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ), demographic
characteristics, work conditions, psychological capital (PsyCap) and
perceived organizational support (POS) was distributed to 1300
registered doctors in Liaoning province. A total of 984 respondents
became our subjects (effective response rate 75.7%). Hierarchical
regression was performed to explore the factors associated with
satisfaction.
Results: The average MSQ score was 65.86 (level ranking for MSQ, 20-100)
in our study population. Hierarchical regression analysis showed that
POS (beta = 0.412, P < 0.001), PsyCap (beta = 0.255, P < 0.001),
incentive system (beta = 0.119, P < 0.001) and educational background
(beta = 0.056, P = 0.042) were positively associated with job
satisfaction.
Conclusions: The job satisfaction of Chinese doctors was at a moderate
level. POS and PsyCap seemed to be the most crucial factors in relation
to job satisfaction. Therefore, efficient measures such as building a
supportive work environment and developing doctors' PsyCap should be
considered by health administrators in order to promote job satisfaction
among Chinese doctors. (C) 2013 The Royal Society for Public Health.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Promotion of prescription drug coupons and vouchers by
pharmaceutical manufacturers has increased in recent years. These
coupons and vouchers usually subsidize patients' cost-sharing
obligations. in other words, drug companies pay for a patient's portion
of the drug cost, and the remaining cost is paid by the patient and the
patient's health plan. This practice is normally used for brand name
drugs but can and has been used for generic drugs. Copayments (also
known as copays), and especially high copays for higher cost drugs, are
used by managed care organizations (MCOs) to place a higher financial
burden on patients and also provide an appreciation of the medication
cost. At the same time, tiered copay plans offer incentives, in the form
of lower copays, to use available equivalent generic alternatives or
lower cost brand name drugs, instead of high cost brand name drugs. With
higher tiered copays for brand name drugs being offset by coupons,
little is known about MCO representatives' perceptions about the use of
copay subsidy coupons for brand name prescription drugs.
OBJECTIVE: To assess health plan managers' and pharmacy benefit
managers' (PBMs) perceptions about the use of prescription drug copay
subsidy coupons.
METHODS: A 28-item online survey instrument was used to collect data
from health plan and PBM representatives. A sample of 834 MCO
representatives was selected from the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy
membership directory. Pharmacists, managers, directors, and executive
officers working in pharmacy, formulary, and clinical pharmacy
operations were selected for the survey. Respondents from non-MCO
settings and government-sponsored health plans were excluded from the
survey.
RESULTS: A total of 122 surveys were returned after 3 emails (i.e., an
invitation and 2 reminder emails) of which 105 were usable surveys,
giving a response rate of 13.7%. A 5-point, 11-item Likert scale (1 =
Strongly Disagree and 5 = Strongly Agree) was used to measure
respondents' perceptions toward prescription drug coupons. Some items
referred to coupons used repeatedly over a year to get copay discounts
(i.e., long-term use coupons) whereas some items referred to coupons
distributed for trial purposes (i.e., short-term use coupons). Of the
105 respondents, 100 (95.2%) agreed that copay subsidy coupons
encouraged nonpreferred brand name drugs over preferred brand name
drugs. A total of 102 (97.2%) respondents agreed that brand name drug
coupons undermined tiered formulary structure. Ninety-two (87.6%)
respondents agreed that short-term use coupons increased plan sponsor's
costs while 96 (91.5%) respondents agreed that sponsor cost increased
with long-term use coupons. A total of 68 (64.8%) agreed that
short-term use coupons should be eliminated whereas 78 (74.3%)
respondents agreed that long-term use coupons should be eliminated.
CONCLUSION: Among MCOs' many business activities are efforts to contain
rising pharmacy costs. The results of this survey indicate that MCO
representatives believe that incentive programs such as prescription
drug coupons and vouchers lead to an increase in brand name drug
utilization, which undermines their formulary controls and, in turn, can
be expected to increase overall health care costs. Copyright (c) 2013,

N2  - Introduction: In Australia, faecal incontinence, the involuntary loss of
liquid or solid stool with or without a person's awareness, has been
reported in 8% of the South Australian and 11% of the urban New South
Wales community-dwelling populations. Studies conducted in 2004 and 2005
reported faecal incontinence in more than 20% of colorectal and
urogynaecological clinic patients at Townsville Hospital (a referral
centre serving rural North Queensland). This prompted concern regarding
the level of faecal incontinence in the community. The aim of this study
was to investigate the prevalence of faecal incontinence in the North
and Far North Queensland urban and rural communities.
Methods: The sample size was based on the New South Wales postal surveys
(11% prevalence). Higher rates were expected in North/Far North
Queensland, so prevalence there was estimated at 12.1% (confidence
interval +/- 2%, ie the true level to be between 10.1% and 14.1%).
The sample for each of the Townsville, Cairns (in Far North Queensland)
and rural/remote settings was calculated at 1022. The database for the
present study was compiled using a systematic randomised process
selecting two private names from each column on each page of the Cairns
and Townsville White Pages (R) (Cairns: 1112 urban, 481 rural, 226
remote; Townsville: 1049 urban, 432 rural, 320 remote). The
questionnaire covered personal demographics, health/risk factors, bowel
habits, nutrition (fibre and fluid intake) and physical activity. Faecal
incontinence was defined as accidental leakage of solid or liquid stool
in the past 12 months that was not caused by a virus, medication or
contaminated food. To improve the response rate a participation
incentive of a chance to win a $250 voucher or one of ten $50 vouchers
was offered in the initial mail-out. The initial survey was mailed out
in July 2007; two follow-up surveys were mailed out to non-responders in
September 2007 and January 2008. One hundred randomly selected
non-responders were telephoned in February 2008.
Results: A total of 1523 responses provided a 48.1% response rate.
Faecal incontinence prevalence was 12.7% (174/1366) with no gender or
locality differences. Prevalence increased significantly with age in men
(p=0.034), but not in women. Only 10 respondents with faecal
incontinence consulted their doctor in the previous year for this
reason. Incontinent respondents had significantly more medical
conditions including urinary incontinence, coeliac disease, irritable
bowel syndrome, injury to the anus, bowel cancer, spinal cord disease,
neurological disease and psychiatric problems (all, p<0.05).
Stool-related accidental bowel leakage including faecal incontinence
(defined), soiling with flatus or urgency, was 18.2%. An additional 3%
were possibly incontinent, having disclosed leakage of mucus, bothersome
or passive staining. Of the remaining respondents, 16.2% reported
incontinent episodes due to an acute illness, 22.9% could not always
differentiate between flatus and stool, and only 35.2% reported neither
concerns with nor accidental bowel leakage.
Conclusions: There is a high level of untreated faecal incontinence in
North/Far North Queensland communities. Demand for treatment will
increase because of the ageing population and the expectations of
younger, more assertive cohorts.

N2  - The Mental Health Nurse Incentive Program (MHNIP) is a government-funded
programme, which, since 2007, has enabled mental health nurses to work
in primary care settings in Australia in collaboration with general
practitioners (GPs) or private psychiatrists. To date, small-scale
qualitative studies have explored outcomes of the programme from the
point of view of nurses, consumers, and the perceptions of GPs. This
study reports on an on-line survey of credentialed mental health nurses
perceptions of outcomes of the MHNIP. Two hundred and twenty five nurses
who worked in MHNIP provided detailed narrative responses that were
examined using thematic content analysis. The most commonly-cited
outcomes were reductions in symptoms or improved coping, improved
relationships, and enhanced community participation. Other reported
outcomes included reduced hospitalization or use of state-funded mental
health services, better use of health services, the continuation or
establishment of meaningful occupation, improved physical health and
medication management, less use of coercive interventions, and greater
independence.

N2  - Background: Nursing shortages and maldistribution are priority issues
for healthcare systems around the globe. Such imbalances are often
aggravated in underserved areas, especially in developing countries.
Despite the centrality of this issue, there is a dearth of studies that
examine the retention of nurses in underserved areas in the Middle East
Region. This study investigates the characteristic and the factors
associated with the retention of nurses working in rural areas in
Lebanon.
Methods: This study uses a non-experimental cross-sectional design to
survey nurses working in underserved areas of Lebanon. Underserved areas
in Lebanon were identified using WHO definition. A total of 103 health
facilities (hospitals and primary healthcare centers) located in these
areas were identified and all nurses working at these facilities
received a copy of the survey questionnaire. The questionnaire included
five sections: demographic, work-life, career plan, job satisfaction,
and assessment of work environment. Analysis included univariate and
bivariate (chi-square, Student's t-test and ANOVA) tests to describe the
respondents and examine the significance between nurses' characteristics
and their intent to stay. A logistic regression model was constructed to
identify factors associated with nurses' intent to stay in underserved
areas.
Results: A total of 857 nurses from 63 Primary Healthcare (PHC) centers
and hospitals responded to the questionnaire (75.5% response rate).
Only 35.1% of nurses indicated their intent to stay in their current
job over the coming one to three years. Surveyed nurses were most
satisfied with relationship with co-workers and least satisfied with
extrinsic rewards. Rural nurses working in PHC centers were more
satisfied than their hospital counterparts on all aspects of work and
had significantly higher intention to stay (62.5% compared to 31.5% in
hospitals, P < 0.001). Regression analysis revealed that nurses less
likely to report intent to stay were younger, unmarried, with less years
of work experience and were not working towards a higher degree.
Analysis reveals a directly proportional relationship between nurses'
reported job satisfaction and their intent to stay.
Conclusion: This study reveals poor retention of nurses in rural and
underserved areas in Lebanon, especially in the hospital sector. The
status quo is disquieting as it reflects an unstable and dissatisfied
nursing workforce. Developing targeted retention strategies for younger
nurses and those working in hospitals as well as the offering of
professional development opportunities and devising an incentive scheme
targeting rural nurses is pivotal to enhance nurses' job satisfaction
and retention in rural settings.

N2  - The feeling of being observed or merely participating in an experiment
can affect individuals' behavior. Referred to as the Hawthorne effect,
this inconsistently observed phenomenon can both provide insight into
individuals' behavior and confound the interpretation of experimental
manipulations. Here, we pursue both topics in examining how the
Hawthorne effect emerges in a large field experiment focused on
residential consumers' electricity use. These consumers received five
postcards notifying, and then reminding, them of their participation in
a study of household electricity use. We found evidence for a Hawthorne
(study participation) effect, seen in a reduction of their electricity
use-even though they received no information, instruction, or incentives
to change. Responses to a follow-up survey suggested that the effect
reflected heightened awareness of energy consumption. Consistent with
that interpretation, the treatment effect vanished when the intervention
ended.

N2  - Background: Factors influencing specialty choice have been studied in an
attempt to find incentives to enhance the workforce in certain
specialties. The notion of ``controllable lifestyle (CL)
specialties,{''} defined by work hours and income, is gaining in
popularity. As a result, many reports advocate providing a
`lifestyle-friendly' work environment to attract medical graduates.
However, little has been documented about the priority in choosing
specialties across the diverse career opportunities. This nationwide
study was conducted in Japan with the aim of identifying factors that
influence specialty choice. It looked for characteristic profiles among
senior students and junior doctors who were choosing between different
specialties.
Methods: We conducted a survey of 4th and 6th (final)-year medical
students and foundation year doctors, using a questionnaire enquiring
about their specialty preference and to what extent their decision was
influenced by a set of given criteria. The results were subjected to a
factor analysis. After identifying factors, we analysed a subset of
responses from 6th year students and junior doctors who identified a
single specialty as their future career, to calculate a z-score
(standard score) of each factor and then we plotted the scores on a
cobweb chart to visualise characteristic profiles.
Results: Factor analysis yielded 5 factors that influence career
preference. Fifteen specialties were sorted into 4 groups based on the
factor with the highest z-score: ``fulfilling life with job security{''}
(radiology, ophthalmology, anaesthesiology, dermatology and psychiatry),
``bioscientific orientation{''} (internal medicine subspecialties,
surgery, obstetrics and gynaecology, emergency medicine, urology, and
neurosurgery), and ``personal reasons{''} (paediatrics and
orthopaedics). Two other factors were ``advice from others{''} and
``educational experience{''}. General medicine / family medicine and
otolaryngology were categorized as ``intermediate{''} group because of
similar degree of influence from 5 factors.
Conclusion: What is valued in deciding a career varies between
specialties. Emphasis on lifestyle issues, albeit important, might
dissuade students and junior doctors who are more interested in
bioscientific aspects of the specialty or have strong personal reasons
to pursue the career choice. In order to secure balanced workforce
across the specialties, enrolling students with varied background and
beliefs should be considered in the student selection process.

N2  - Background: Poor response rates can jeopardise the validity of the
findings of epidemiological surveys. The aim of this study was to
undertake a randomised controlled trial to determine the effectiveness
of different strategies for maximizing parental consent rates for dental
health surveys of young children.
Methods: The trial took place within the 2007/2008 NHS Epidemiological
Dental Health Survey of 5-year-old children in the North West of
England. Schools were randomised to one of five interventions: multiple
letters to parents; promoting the research by providing additional
information to parents and children; a financial incentive to the
school; a financial incentive to the school administrator plus direct
mailing to parents; and a control intervention comprising of usual
practice, that is a single letter home to parents via the children.
Results: A total of 335 schools (11,088 children) were recruited. The
mean percentage consent rates ranged from 47% (financial incentive to
school administrator plus direct mailing) to 63% (multiple letters).
Pair-wise comparisons indicated that the multiple letter group had a
statistically significantly greater consent rate than the financial
incentive to the school administrator plus direct mailing group and
promoting the research by providing additional information group, but
was not statistically significantly different from the financial
incentive to the school group and the control group.
Conclusions: There was little evidence to show that any of the five
interventions made a significant difference to consent rates when
compared to the control group. Financial incentives to schools were less
effective than multiple reminder letters to parents. Trials should be
built into surveys to test different interventions, in different
contexts to expand the evidence base for improving consent rates in
health surveillance programmes.

N2  - Identifying efficient and effective ways of tailoring survey designs is
critical in the face of decreasing response rates, increasing
differential nonresponse, and rising survey costs. Utilizing auxiliary
information appended to an initial sample frame allows researchers both
to drive differential or tailored treatments across the sample and to
enrich back-end analyses, including a simple and efficient form of
nonresponse assessment. In this study, we leverage variables appended to
an address-based sample (ABS) design to (1) target different levels of
incentives to some of the traditionally hardest-to-reach groups (e.g.,
younger adults, Blacks, and Hispanics) and (2) examine the potential for
bias in the survey results by comparing respondents and nonrespondents
across an array of key sample frame variables. Using data from a
national ABS sample of 4,000 addresses, the study demonstrates that
differential nonresponse is a problem with particular sets of addresses
on the ABS frame (those with no telephone match), and although use of a
mail survey combined with targeted incentives seems to reduce this
effect, there is no single incentive structure-survey mode combination
that works well across the three hardest-to-reach groups. The approach
also allows researchers to assess the potential for nonresponse bias
before determining if more extensive (and expensive) nonresponse
follow-up methodologies need to be employed.

N2  - The versatility, speed, and reduced costs with which web surveys can be
conducted with clinicians are often offset by low response rates.
Drawing on best practices and general recommendations in the literature,
we provide an evidence-based overview of methods for conducting online
surveys with providers. We highlight important advantages and
disadvantages of conducting provider surveys online and include a review
of differences in response rates between web and mail surveys of
clinicians. When administered online, design-based features affect rates
of survey participation and data quality. We examine features likely to
have an impact including sample frames, incentives, contacts (type,
timing, and content), mixed-mode approaches, and questionnaire length.
We make several recommendations regarding optimal web-based designs, but
more empirical research is needed, particularly with regard to
identifying which combinations of incentive and contact approaches yield
the highest response rates and are the most cost-effective.

N2  - Surveys involving health care providers are characterized by low and
declining response rates (RRs), and researchers have utilized various
strategies to increase survey RRs among health professionals. Based on
48 studies with 156 subgroups of within-study conditions, a multilevel
meta-regression analysis was conducted to summarize the effects of
different strategies employed in surveys of health professionals. An
estimated overall survey RR among health professionals was 0.53 with a
significant downward trend during the last half century. Of the
variables that were examined, mode of data collection, incentives, and
number of follow-up attempts were all found to be significantly related
to RR. The mail survey mode was more effective in improving RR, compared
to the online or web survey mode. Relative to the non-incentive
subgroups, subgroups receiving monetary incentives were more likely to
respond, while nonmonetary incentive groups were not significantly
different from non-incentive groups. When number of follow-ups was
considered, the one or two attempts of follow-up were found to be
effective in increasing survey RR among health professionals. Having
noted challenges associated with surveying health professionals,
researchers must make every effort to improve access to their target
population by implementing appropriate incentive- and design-based
strategies demonstrated to improve participation rates.

N2  - Background: Survey response rates have been declining over the past
decade. The more widespread use of the Internet and Web-based
technologies among potential health survey participants suggests that
Web-based questionnaires may be an alternative to paper questionnaires
in future epidemiological studies.
Objective: To compare response rates in a population of parents by using
4 different modes of data collection for a questionnaire survey of which
1 involved a nonmonetary incentive.
Methods: A random sample of 3148 parents of Danish children aged 2-17
years were invited to participate in the Danish part of the NordChild
2011 survey on their children's health and welfare. NordChild was
conducted in 1984 and 1996 in collaboration with Finland, Iceland,
Norway, and Sweden using mailed paper questionnaires only. In 2011, all
countries used conventional paper versions only except Denmark where the
parents were randomized into 4 groups: (1) 789 received a paper
questionnaire only (paper), (2) 786 received the paper questionnaire and
a log-in code to the Web-based questionnaire (paper/Web), (3) 787
received a log-in code to the Web-based questionnaire (Web), and (4) 786
received log-in details to the Web-based questionnaire and were given an
incentive consisting of a chance to win a tablet computer (Web/tablet).
In connection with the first reminder, the nonresponders in the paper,
paper/Web, and Web groups were also present with the opportunity to win
a tablet computer as a means of motivation. Descriptive analysis was
performed using chi-square tests. Odds ratios were used to estimate
differences in response rates between the 4 modes.
Results: In 2011, 1704 of 3148 (54.13%) respondents answered the Danish
questionnaire. The highest response rate was with the paper mode (n=443,
56.2%). The other groups had similar response rates: paper/Web (n=422,
53.7%), Web (n=420, 53.4%), and Web/tablet (n=419, 53.3%) modes.
Compared to the paper mode, the odds for response rate in the paper/Web
decreased by 9% (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.74-1.10) and by 11% (OR 0.89, 95%
CI 0.73-1.09) in the Web and Web/tablet modes. The total number of
responders for NordChild declined from 10,291 of 15,339 (67.09%) in
1984 and 10,667 of 15,254 (69.93%) in 1996 to 7805 of 15,945 (48.95%)
in 2011 with similar declines in all 5 Nordic countries.
Conclusions: Web-based questionnaires could replace traditional paper
questionnaires with minor effects on response rates and lower costs. The
increasing effect on the response rate on participants replying for a
nonmonetary incentive could only be estimated within the 2 Web-based
questionnaire modes before the first reminder. Alternative platforms to
reach higher participation rates in population surveys should reflect
the development of electronic devices and the ways in which the
population primarily accesses the Internet.

N2  - Background: Few studies have investigated the effect of small
unconditional non-monetary incentives on survey response rates amongst
GPs or medical practitioners. This study assessed the effectiveness of
offering a small unconditional non-financial incentive to increase
survey response rates amongst general practitioners within a randomised
controlled trial (RCT).
Methods: An RCT was conducted within a general practice survey that
investigated how to prolong working lives amongst ageing GPs in
Australia. GPs (n = 125) were randomised to receive an attractive pen or
no pen during their first invitation for participation in a survey. GPs
could elect to complete the survey online or via mail. Two follow up
reminders were sent without a pen to both groups. The main outcome
measure was response rates.
Results: The response rate for GPs who received a pen was higher in the
intervention group (61.9%) compared to the control group (46.8%). This
study did not find a statistically significant effect of a small
unconditional non-financial incentive (in the form of a pen) on survey
response rates amongst GPs (Odds ratio, 95% confidence interval: 1.85
(0.91 to 3.77). No GPs completed the online version.
Conclusion: A small unconditional non-financial incentives, in the form
of a pen, may improve response rates for GPs.

N2  - Background: The use of supply-side incentives to increase health service
utilisation and enhance service quality is gaining momentum in many low-
and middle-income countries. However, there is a paucity of evidence on
the impact of such schemes, their cost-effectiveness, and the process of
implementation and potential unintended consequences in these settings.
A pay for performance (P4P) programme was introduced in Pwani region of
Tanzania in 2011.
Methods/design: An evaluation of the programme will be carried out to
inform a potential national rollout. A controlled before and after study
will examine the effect of the P4P programme on quality, coverage, and
cost of targeted maternal and newborn healthcare services and selected
non-targeted services at facilities in Tanzania. Data will be collected
from a survey of 75 facilities, 750 patients exiting consultations, over
75 health workers, and 1,500 households of women who delivered in the
previous year, in all seven intervention districts. Data will be
collected from the same number of respondents in four control districts.
A process evaluation will examine: whether the P4P programme was
implemented as planned; stakeholder response to the programme and its
acceptability; and implementation bottlenecks and facilitating factors.
Three rounds of process data collection will be conducted including a
review of available P4P documents, individual interviews and focus group
discussions with key informants working at facility and district level
in five of the intervention districts, and at the regional and national
levels. An economic evaluation will measure the cost-effectiveness of
P4P relative to current practice from a societal perspective.
Discussion: This evaluation will contribute robust evidence on the
impact and cost-effectiveness of P4P in a low income setting, as well as
generate a better understanding of the feasibility of integrating
complex intervention packages like P4P within health systems in resource
poor settings.

N2  - While disclosure of HIV sero-status is encouraged in the management of
the HIV and AIDS epidemic, it remains a challenge, especially among
family members. This article examines the moral dilemmas and pragmatic
incentives surrounding disclosure of HIV status in contemporary Uganda.
Our findings are based on 12 in-depth interviews, 2 focus-group
discussions, 6 key informant interviews with AIDS activists, and
open-ended responses derived from 148 HIV-positive persons in a
quantitative survey. The study was conducted in 2008-2009 in Kampala,
Mpigi, and Soroti districts in Uganda. We found both parents and adult
children facing dilemmas in disclosure, whether it was parents revealing
their own HIV status to their children or the status of their
perinatally infected children, or young people infected through sexual
intercourse telling their parents. For both groups, there is fear of
blame, stigma, discrimination, and shame and guilt related to unsafe
sex, while young people also fear loss of privileges. On the other hand,
there are practical imperatives for disclosure in terms of gaining
access to care, treatment, and material resources. Faced with these
dilemmas, HIV-positive people and their families require professional
counselling to help them work through the emotional challenges
encountered and identify mechanisms of support and coping.

16-17, 2012
N2  - Background. The American College of Surgeons/Association of Program
Directors in Surgery (ACS/APDS) National Skills Curriculum is a 3-phase
program targeting technical and nontechnical skills development. Few
data exist regarding the adoption of this curriculum by surgical
residencies. This study attempted to determine the rate of uptake and
identify implementation enablers/barriers.
Methods. A web-based survey was developed by an international expert
panel of surgical educators (5 surgeons and 1 psychologist). After
piloting, the survey was sent to all general surgery program directors
via email link. Descriptive statistics were used to determine the
residency program characteristics and perceptions of the curriculum.
Implementation rates for each phase and module were calculated. Adoption
barriers were identified quantitatively and qualitatively using free
text responses. Standardized qualitative methodology of emergent theme
analysis was used to identify strategies for success and details of
support required for implementation.
Results. Of the 238 program directors approached, 117(49%) responded to
the survey. Twenty-one percent (25/117) were unaware of the ACS/APDS
curriculum. Implementation rates for were 36% for phase I, 19% for
phase II, and 16% for phase III. The most common modules adopted were
the suturing knot-tying and chest tube modules of phase I. Over 50% of
respondents identified lack of faculty protected time, limited
personnel, significant costs, and resident work-hour restrictions as
major obstacles to implementation. Strategies for effective uptake
included faculty incentives, adequate funding, administrative support,,
and dedicated time and resources.
Conclusion. Despite the availability of a comprehensive curriculum, its
diffusion into general surgery residency programs remains low. Obstacles
related to successful implementation include personnel, learner, and
administrative issues. Addressing these issues may improve the adoption
rate of the curriculum.

N2  - Federal initiatives are underway that provide physicians with financial
incentives for meaningful use (MU) of electronic health records (EHRs)
and assistance to purchase and implement EHRs.
We sought to examine readiness and interest in MU among primary care
physicians and specialists, and identify factors that may affect their
readiness to obtain MU incentives.
We analyzed 4 years of data (2008-2011) from the National Ambulatory
Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) Electronic Medical Record (EMR) Supplement,
an annual cross-sectional nationally representative survey of
non-federally employed office-based physicians.
Survey-weighted EHR adoption rates, potential to meet selected MU
criteria, and self-reported intention to apply for MU incentives. We
also examined the association between physician and practice
characteristics and readiness for MU.
The overall sample consisted of 10,889 respondents, with weighted
response rates of 62 % (2008); 74 % (2009); 66 % (2010); and 61 %
(2011). Primary care physicians' adoption of EHRs with the potential to
meet MU nearly doubled from 2009 to 2011 (18 % to 38 %, p < 0.01), and
was significantly higher than specialists (19 %) in 2011 (p < 0.01). In
2011, half of physicians (52 %) expressed their intention to apply for
MU incentives; this did not vary by specialty. Multivariate analyses
report that EHR adoption was significantly higher in both 2010 and 2011
compared to 2009, and primary care physicians and physicians working in
larger or multi-specialty practices or for HMOs were more likely to
adopt EHRs with the potential to meet MU.
Physician EHR adoption rates increased in advance of MU incentive
payments. Although interest in MU incentives did not vary by specialty,
primary care physicians had significantly higher rates of adopting EHRs
with the potential to meet MU. Addressing barriers to EHR adoption,
which may vary by specialty, will be important to enhancing coordination
of care.

N2  - Background. Surveys are important research tools that permit the
accumulation of information from large samples that would otherwise be
impractical to collect. Resident surveys have been used frequently to
monitor the quality of postgraduate training. Low response rates
threaten the utility of this research tool. The purpose of this study
was to determine the standard response rate of surveys administered to
surgery residents and identify characteristics associated with achieving
greater response rates.
Methods. A search of peer-reviewed literature published between
September 2003 and June 2011 was performed with the use of PubMed with
Medical Subject Headings: ``internship and residency,{''} ``surgery,{''}
``data collection,{''} and ``questionnaires.{''} For inclusion, articles
must have described a survey given to active surgery residents within
the United States. Surveys were evaluated based on the following
criteria: population size, response rate, incentive use, follow-up use,
survey format (online vs paper), and institution versus national.
Results. Of 433 initial results, 47 met inclusion criteria with a mean
response rate of 65.3%. Surveys administered in paper format had a
greater response rate compared with those given electronically (mean
78.6% vs 36.4%, respectively, P < .001). Greatest mean response rates
were seen for institutional surveys compared with those given nationally
(83.1% vs 42% respectively, P < .001)
Conclusion. Our review demonstrated that paper surveys administered at
the institutional level and during assemblies integrated into residents'
schedules demonstrated enhanced response rates. The validity and
generalizability of data collected through such survey's will improve as
the aspects which dictate response rate are better understood and
implemented.

N2  - Background: In spite of massive efforts to generalize efficient
prevention, such as insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITN) or
long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), malaria remains prevalent in
many countries and ITN/LLINs are still only used to a limited extent.
Methods: This study proposes a new model for malaria economic analysis
by combining economic epidemiology tools with the literature on poverty
traps. A theoretical model of rational protective behaviour in response
to malaria is designed, which includes endogenous externalities and
disease characteristics. Survey data available for Uganda provide
empirical support to the theory of prevalence-elastic protection
behaviours, once endogeneity issues related to epidemiology and poverty
are solved.
Results: Two important conclusions emerge from the model. First, agents
increase their protective behaviour when malaria is more prevalent in a
society. This is consistent with the literature on ``prevalence-elastic
behaviour{''}. Second, a `malaria trap' defined as the result of malaria
reinforcing poverty while poverty reduces the ability to deal with
malaria can theoretically exist and the conditions of existence of the
malaria trap are identified.
Conclusions: These results suggest the possible existence of malaria
traps, which provides policy implications. Notably, providing ITN/LLINs
at subsidized prices is not sufficient. To be efficient an ITN/LLINs
dissemination campaigns should include incentive of the very poor for
using ITN/LLINs.

N2  - Background: Mental illness is the prime reason for the inflow into
disability insurance in many countries. The integration of persons with
a disability into the regular labor market is costly and in the case of
mentally ill persons, particularly difficult. Supported Education and
Employment - a rehabilitation method that directly places patients in a
realistic work environment - has been shown to be effective in
increasing competitive employment. However, it has not yet been widely
implemented.
Aims of the Study: We evaluate ex-ante the willingness to participate in
Supported Education and Employment and the barriers to do so from the
employer's perspective.
Methods: We conducted a discrete choice experiment implemented in an
online survey. The survey was carried out among all Swiss companies
which provide standard dual-track vocational education and training for
commercial occupations in Eastern Switzerland. We presented respondents
(employees who are responsible for vocational training and/or for the
selection of applicants) with a sample of five hypothetical profiles.
These profiles vary along different medical diagnoses, different illness
related (dys-)functions, and other characteristics that may be
associated with a company's willingness to accept the candidate (such as
school performance, motivation, and illness related absences).
Respondents were asked whether or not they would train this person.
Results: 22% of the profiles are accepted. However, our results
demonstrate that the hypothetical bias - which is the difference between
individual saying what they would do in a hypothetical setting and what
they will do when they have the opportunity - is severe. Correcting for
this bias using follow-up scales ({''}Are you sure?{''}) reduces the
overall acceptance in our sample to 9%. Keeping in mind the response
rate to our survey of 35%, overall acceptance may be as low as 3%.
Non-cognitive dysfunctions (e.g. non-adherence to regulations,
difficulties with contacts with others) that are related to mental
disorders, are the main deterrents. Patients with psychotic disorders
are particularly disadvantaged.
Implications for Health Policy: Although there are no direct costs to
the employer, a wide introduction of Supported Vocational Education and
Training is likely to fail at the current stage with the unwillingness
of companies to train people with special needs. There may be additional
incentives needed, for example in form of subsidies or legal
requirements. Even though our experiment has been tailored to the Swiss
system, our results may also be relevant in other countries with similar
dual-track education systems.

N2  - While a large literature indicates that using a mixed-mode approach to
notify or contact potential respondents can be effective in increasing
response rates, surprisingly little research examines the impact the
mode of invitation has on participation in a web survey. To assess the
effects of invitation mode on response rates, costs, and demographic
representativeness, university faculty members (N = 280) were randomly
assigned to experimental groups and sent a mailed invitation letter and
a $2 cash incentive; a mailed invitation letter only; or an e-mailed
invitation. Nonresponding faculty received up to two reminders to
participate, by e-mail. Results indicated that the response rates were
higher for the groups invited using a postal letter, but the inclusion
of $2 did not significantly increase the response rates. Consistent
with expectations, while costs were higher for the mailed invitation
groups, the mailed invitations improved the demographic
representativeness of the respondents, especially for the $2 incentive
group. This study builds on a small body of literature that explicitly
examines the mode of invitation on survey participation in web surveys
and adds to previous findings by examining costs and effects on the
demographic representativeness of the respondents.

N2  - Business incentive use rose dramatically among U.S. municipalities after
the Great Recession. This article seeks to explain that rise using
national surveys of local government economic development practice for
2004 and 2009. The authors differentiate business incentive use by three
types (tax abatements, labor support, and planning) and by new and
experienced users. We find that higher business incentive use is a
response to lower property tax and higher unemployment. We also find
that higher business incentive use is associated with greater attention
to accountability, even among the new business incentive users.
Governments that rely more heavily on tax incentives to firms face more
competition and lower tax revenue than governments that use more
incentives focused on labor and planning. We also find broadening
attention to accountability measures and a widening of community
development investment to arenas that target improved quality of life.

N2  - Purpose
To quantify and compare the preferences of researchers and laypeople in
Canada regarding the outcomes of basic biomedical research.
Method
In autumn 2010, the authors conducted a cross-sectional, national survey
of basic biomedical researchers funded by Canada's national health
research agency and a representative sample of Canadian citizens to
assess preferences for research outcomes across five attributes using a
discrete choice experiment. Attributes included advancing scientific
knowledge (assessed by published papers); building research capacity
(assessed by trainees); informing decisions in the health products
industry (assessed by patents); targeting economic, health, or
scientific priorities; and cost. The authors reduced a fractional
factorial design (18 pairwise choices plus an opt-out option) to three
blocks of six. They also computed part worth utilities, differences in
predicted probabilities, and willingness-to-pay values using nested
logit models.
Results
Of 3,260 potential researchers, 1,749 (53.65% response rate) completed
the questionnaire, along with 1,002 citizens. Researchers and citizens
prioritized high-quality scientific outcomes (papers, trainees) over
other attributes. Both groups disvalued research targeted at economic
priorities relative to health priorities. Researchers granted a premium
to proposals targeting scientific priorities.
Conclusions
Citizens and researchers fundamentally prioritized the same outcomes for
basic biomedical research. Notably, they prioritized traditional
scientific outcomes and disvalued the pursuit of economic returns. These
findings have implications for how academic medicine assigns incentives
and value to basic health research and how biomedical researchers and
the public may jointly contribute to setting the future research agenda.

N2  - Background: It is generally understood that shorter Web surveys and use
of incentives result in higher response rates in Web surveys directed to
health care providers. Less is known about potential respondent
preference for reduced burden as compared to increased reward.
Objective: To help elicit preference for minimized burden compared to
reward for completion of a survey, we observed physician preferences for
shorter Web surveys compared to incentives as well as incentive
preference (small guaranteed incentive compared to larger lottery
incentive) accompanying an electronic request to complete a survey.
Methods: This was an observational study that accompanied a large Web
survey study of radiology staff, fellows, and residents at select
academic medical centers in the United States. With the request to
complete the survey, potential respondents were offered three options:
(1) a 10-minute Web survey with the chance to win an iPad, (2) a
10-minute Web survey with a guaranteed nominal incentive ($ 5 amazon.
com gift card), or (3) a shorter (5-7 minute) Web survey with no
incentive. A total of 254 individuals responded to the Web survey
request.
Results: Overwhelmingly, individuals chose a longer survey accompanied
by an incentive compared to a shorter survey with no incentive (85%
compared to 15%, P <. 001). Of those opting for an incentive, a small,
but not significant majority chose the chance to win an iPad over a
guaranteed $5 gift card (56% compared to 44%).
Conclusions: When given the choice, radiologists preferred a reward
(either guaranteed or based on a lottery) to a less burdensome survey,
indicating that researchers should focus more attention at increasing
perceived benefits of completing a Web survey compared to decreasing
perceived burden.

N2  - This study drew on teacher survey responses from randomized experiments
exploring three different pay-for-performance programs to examine the
extent to which these programs motivated teachers to improve student
achievement and the impact of such programs on teachers' instruction,
number of hours worked, job stress, and collegiality. Results showed
that most teachers did not report their program as motivating. Moreover,
the survey responses suggest that none of the three programs changed
teachers' instruction, increased their number of hours worked or job
stress, or damaged their collegiality. Future research needs to further
examine the logic model of pay-for-performance programs and test
alternative incentive models such as rewarding teachers based on their
practices and job responsibilities rather than on student outcomes.

N2  - Accurate domestic-hot water (DHW) consumption information is useful for
solar-thermal-hot-water-system designers and policy makers supporting
solar-thermal-incentive programs. Conducting field studies of
DHW-consumption patterns is difficult and costly, and as a result, there
are few studies available in the body of literature. Several DHW models
exist, however these aggregate models are often dated and most fail to
identify the influence of the number of occupants in the dwelling,
instead relying on a standard-per-capita consumption. The standard of 60
liters/capita/day (lcd) is found to be accurate for households of 4 or
more occupants, but significantly under estimates per-capita-hot-water
consumption for households with 3 or fewer occupants, consequently,
under estimating the energy and GHG-emissions savings of solar-DHW
programs {[}1]. The new estimate presented here addresses these issues.
This study was conducted using utility-billing data, and occupant
responses from a survey of 1594 residences. The data includes annual
total-water use, energy consumption, costs, and basic information about
the residence and occupants. The method isolates average-oil used in
water heaters and then estimates system performance to calculate the
volume of hot water heated. The findings include total-water use, oil
consumption for water heating, and DHW use based on occupancy for
households of 1 through 6 occupants. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

N2  - In the U.S. today, there is a significant danger that walkable
communities are becoming unaffordable to low and even moderate-income
residents. This paper reports on the results of a survey of affordable
housing developers that was conducted to provide a better understanding
of what kinds of strategies could be used to substantially increase the
prevalence of walkable, mixed-income neighborhoods from the point of
view of developers. Thirty-four developers from around the U.S. were
interviewed by telephone in November and December, 2010. Five themes
emerged from the survey: the need for financing and access to capital
and subsidy; the need for reform of financial regulation; the need for
reform of land use regulation; the need for incentives; and the need for
better communication and networking. Responses to the survey underscored
the frustrations affordable housing developers are having with
development more generally, and how those frustrations are amplified
when trying to locate affordable housing in walkable, mixed-income
neighborhoods. The paper concludes by suggesting strategies that could
be employed to help promote walkable, mixed-income neighborhoods, beyond
the obvious need for better access to capital: support for research that
focuses on the benefits of mixed-income neighborhoods; documentation and
illumination of best practices; and the fostering of communication and
partnerships among a diverse set of advocates.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of two incentive
conditions (a $10 pre-incentive only vs. a $2 pre-incentive and a $10
promised incentive) on response rates, sample composition, substantive
data, and cost-efficiency in a survey of college student substance use
and related behaviors. Participants were 3000 randomly-selected college
students invited to participate in a survey on substance use. Registrar
data on all invitees was used to compare response rates and respondents,
and web-based data collection on participants was used to compare
substantive findings. Participants randomized to the pre-incentive plus
promised incentive condition were more likely to complete the survey and
less likely to give partial responses. Subgroup differences by sex,
class year, and race were evaluated among complete responders, although
only sex differences were significant. Men were more likely to respond
in the pre-incentive plus promised incentive condition than the
pre-incentive only condition. Substantive data did not differ across
incentive structure, although the pre-incentive plus promised incentive
condition was more cost-efficient. Survey research on college student
populations is warranted to support the most scientifically sound and
cost-efficient studies possible. Although substantive data did not
differ, altering the incentive structure could yield cost savings with
better response rates and more representative samples. (C) 2012 Elsevier

N2  - Despite the proven efficacy of decision aids as interventions for
increasing patient engagement and facilitating shared decision making,
they are not used routinely in clinical care. Findings from a project
designed to achieve such integration, conducted at five primary care
practices in 2010-12, document low rates of distribution of decision
aids to eligible patients due for colorectal cancer screening (9.3
percent) and experiencing back pain (10.7 percent). There were also no
lasting increases in distribution rates in response to training sessions
and other promotional activities for physicians and clinic staff. The
results of focus groups, ethnographic field notes, and surveys suggest
that major structural and cultural changes in health care practice and
policy are necessary to achieve the levels of use of decision aids and
shared decision making in routine practice envisioned in current policy.
Among these changes are ongoing incentives for use, physician training,
and a team-based practice model in which all care team members bear
formal responsibility for the use of decision aids in routine primary
care.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Despite 30 years of policy initiatives and
rural-focused programs, the number of physicians in rural practice
remains unchanged and insufficient for the needs of rural communities.
The practice characteristics of graduates of a rural family medicine
residency program are identified, including community size, practice
content and procedures, and hospital and outpatient services offered and
track any changes in practice location and services.
METHODS: A postgraduate survey instrument was sent to all graduates of
Cascades East Family Medicine Residency beginning with the initial class
of graduates and ending with the alumnae who completed the program in
2009. The response rate was 82%, and data were collated and analyzed
for practice content and demographic characteristics. Changes in
practice location and content were summarized.
RESULTS: Most graduates are located in demonstrated areas of need
immediately following graduation: 60% entered practice in population
centers of less than 25,000; 63% are located in health professional
shortage areas (HPSAs). There was an insignificant migration from rural
to urban locations and little change in practice content over the
duration of the study.
CONCLUSIONS: As a result of this survey, we are aware of the
postgraduate training design that is most successful at producing
primary care physicians who enter isolated rural practice in areas of
greatest need. There is a requirement for training incentives, federal
funding, and Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education
flexibility to support and accommodate the unique needs of training
programs that demonstrate clear outcomes that are congruent with the
needs of the rural American population and produce physicians who enter
rural practice. (Fam Med 2013;45(2):122-7.)

Participants were randomly assigned to receive either a $5 or a $10
prepaid incentive. In line with the social exchange theory of survey
participation, no significant differences were found in response rate
between the two conditions. However, the incentive amount interacted
with gender. Specifically, women were more likely to respond to the
survey when provided with a $5 incentive compared to a $10 incentive.

N2  - Community-wide efforts to encourage healthy behaviours must respond to
the needs of existing neighbourhoods, especially those where low
physical activity (PA) is associated with social, economic, and cultural
challenges. This study reports on the effect of direct and snowball
sampling strategies and financial incentive levels on the response rates
of a built environment and PA survey in a predominately urban, low-SES
new-immigrant community. Women residing in the Jane-Finch neighbourhood
of Toronto, Ontario were selected to participate by quasi-random
sampling, yielding a response rate of 41.5%. The survey completion rate
per contact attempt increased 2-fold when incentives were increased from
$10 to $20 and a further threefold following the increase from $20 to
$30. Snowball sampled respondents were older, less likely to have
full-time employment, and had lower educational attainment than directly
sampled participants. With appropriate incentives, face-to-face contact,
and snowball sampling, survey-based research is feasible within a
low-SES, high minority population.

N2  - Web surveys have become increasingly central to innovation research but
often suffer from low response rates. Based on a cost-benefits framework
and the explicit consideration of heterogeneity across respondents, we
consider the effects of key contact design features such as
personalization, incentives, and the exact timing of survey contacts on
web survey response rates. We also consider the benefits of a ``dynamic
strategy{''}, i.e., the approach to change features of survey contacts
over the survey life cycle. We explore these effects experimentally
using a career survey sent to over 24,000 junior scientists and
engineers. The results show that personalization increases the odds of
responding by as much as 48%, while lottery incentives with a high
payoff and a low chance of winning increase the odds of responding by
30%. Furthermore, changing the wording of reminders over the survey
life cycle increases the odds of a response by over 30%, while changes
in contact timing (day of the week or hour of the day) did not have
significant benefits. Improvements in response rates did not come at the
expense of lower data quality. Our results provide novel insights into
web survey response behavior and suggest useful tools for innovation
researchers seeking to increase survey participation. (C) 2012 Elsevier

N2  - Longevity is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. The
brain's dopamine system may be particularly relevant, since it modulates
traits (e.g., sensitivity to reward, incentive motivation, sustained
effort) that impact behavioral responses to the environment. In
particular, the dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) has been shown to moderate
the impact of environments on behavior and health. We tested the
hypothesis that the DRD4 gene influences longevity and that its impact
is mediated through environmental effects. Surviving participants of a
30-year-old population-based health survey (N = 310; age range, 90-109
years; the 90+ Study) were genotyped/resequenced at the DRD4 gene and
compared with a European ancestry-matched younger population (N = 2902;
age range, 7-45 years). We found that the oldest-old population had a
66% increase in individuals carrying the DRD47R allele relative to the
younger sample (p = 3.5 x 10(-9)), and that this genotype was strongly
correlated with increased levels of physical activity. Consistent with
these results, DRD4 knock-out mice, when compared with wild-type and
heterozygous mice, displayed a 7-9.7% decrease in lifespan, reduced
spontaneous locomotor activity, and no lifespan increase when reared in
an enriched environment. These results support the hypothesis that DRD4
gene variants contribute to longevity in humans and in mice, and suggest
that this effect is mediated by shaping behavioral responses to the
environment.

N2  - When we assume that a survey reveals respondents' true attitudes we
tacitly assume that the subjects understood what we are asking them
about and that they had no incentive to be untruthful. In typical
studies none of the two assumptions holds. Subjects are asked questions
that use undefined terms and they are asked about issues they have no
incentive to answer truthfully. Here we argue that a way to solve the
two problems lies in constructing a formal theory of an attitude in such
a way that an attitude can be derived from the answers yet when
answering the questions subjects cannot possibly know that their
responses reveal anything about their attitude and, hence, they have no
incentive to answer insincerely. We briefly discuss a study that has the
desirable properties necessary for the proper design.

N2  - Address-based sampling (ABS) with a two-phase data collection approach
has emerged as a promising alternative to random digit dial (RDD)
telephone surveys for studying specific subpopulations in the United
States. In 2011, the National Household Education Surveys Program Field
Test used a two-phase ABS design with a postal screener to identify
households with eligible children and a postal topical questionnaire
administered to parents of sampled children to collect measures of
interest. Experiments with prepaid cash incentives and special mail
delivery methods were applied in both phases. For the screener, sampled
addresses were randomly designated to receive either $2 or $5 in the
initial mailing. During the topical phase, incentives (ranging from $0
to $20) and delivery methods (First Class Mail or Priority Mail) were
assigned randomly but depended on how quickly the household had
responded to the screener. The paper first evaluates the effects of
incentives on response rates, and then examines incentive levels for
attracting the hard-to-reach groups and improving sample composition.
The impact of incentive on data collection cost is also examined.

N2  - Agricultural farmers are experiencing change in how they must manage
surface water storage systems. When faced with water shortage in times
of drought, there is an incentive to build up stores of water and this
can be inequitable for users downstream. Furthermore, in times of water
surplus in flood, the storage structures can become unsafe, with
catastrophic consequences. Despite the importance of the `dual-extreme'
problem of unsustainably managed farm dams, there is also evidence of
deficiencies and inconsistencies in farm dam management policy across
Australia. When coupled with evidence of widespread unsustainable farm
dam management practice, the way farmers respond to management pressures
from regulators becomes a critical concern. The research applies
Oliver's strategic response typology to a survey of 202 farmers in two
states in Australia with different levels of sustainable surface water
storage equity and safety policy: disconnectedness in South Australia,
and interconnectedness in Tasmania. Results suggest that even in a
strong, interconnected policy environment, where laws are in line with
farmer goals and do not infringe on decision-making power, there may
still be resistance and attempts to manipulate the regulatory pressures.
Findings indicate a need to consider more flexible elements of
regulation adaptable to specific settings.

N2  - The responses given in opinion polls on future policy reforms reflect
both subjective expectations and preferences. We disentangle these
factors using data from a controlled survey experiment conducted in
Germany. At the time of the experiment, an increased retirement age had
been proposed as part of a pension reform. Thus, the survey respondents
faced an incentive to give biased responses. By understating their
expected work ability at the age of retirement, they could make the
increase of the retirement age a less attractive policy option. We find
evidence for such strategic response behavior, and this strategic bias
appears to be stronger in former communist East Germany.

N2  - Background/Context: Institutional theories sometimes characterize the
normative influence of institutions as diffusing like waves and as
exerting uniform pressures on individuals. This article contributes to a
growing literature on the microfoundations of institutions,
investigating how intraorganizational networks mediate the diffusion of
institutions on teachers' instructional practices.
Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: This study focused
on the normative influence of reading policy on teaching practice in the
early 2000s. We chose to focus on reading during this period, which was
marked by an unusual level of policy coherence. Federal and state
agencies, as well as school districts, implemented a number of policies
and programs to encourage teachers to follow the National Reading
Panel's (2000) recommendations to emphasize basic skills development in
reading instructional practices.
Setting: The research took place in 11 elementary schools. An important
note is that the pressure teachers experienced in these schools to adopt
the practices recommended by the National Reading Panel was indirect.
The schools in the study did include three Title I schools, but no
schools in programs that required them to adopt these practices. All
schools used state-adopted curricula in reading that were aligned with
recommended practices.
Population/Participants/Subjects: All faculty members in the 11 schools
were part of the study from 2004 to 2008. The sample in the final
analysis (n = 136) included teachers with direct responsibilities for
teaching reading in a single school over these 4 years. This figure
represents 84.47% of our original sample (N = 161).
Research Design: This study is a longitudinal observational study that
includes social network data and multilevel analysis. We surveyed
faculty four times in waves conducted in 2004, 2005, 2007, and 2008.
Data Collection and Analysis: The primary source of data was a survey
that asked teachers to identify their close colleagues and colleagues
who provided them with help on reading instruction (including measures
of frequency of interaction). The dependent measure in our analyses was
based teachers' responses to items about instructional practices in
reading, especially skills-based instructional practices. We fit
multilevel models to estimate the extent to which reading practices were
a function of teachers' interactions with colleagues and their
membership in subgroups, which were identified from the indicators of
closest colleagues using Frank's algorithm.
Findings/Results: Teachers' practices did not conform exclusively to the
new normative regime but rather depended on exposure to external
professional development in reading instruction and on local norms of
practice in their schools and collegial subgroups. Over time, moreover,
subgroups' practices diverged with respect to teachers' implementation
of skills-based reading instructional practices.
Conclusions/Recommendations: Our study findings provide strong evidence
that local social dynamics such as the ones we illuminate here are key
in shaping the implementation trajectory of any instructional practice
or reform. Policies may set the stage for adopting particular practices
and direct resources toward certain kinds of supports through curriculum
and professional development programs they incentivize. However,
teachers' interactions with colleagues mediate the response to these
directions and incentives in ways that can produce outcomes that diverge
widely from policy makers' intentions.

N2  - Background: It is imperative to understand how to engage young women in
research about issues that are important to them. There is limited
reliable data on how young women access contraception in Australia
especially in rural areas where services may be less available.
Objective: This paper identifies the challenges involved in engaging
young Australian women aged 18-23 years to participate in a web-based
survey on contraception and pregnancy and ensure their ongoing
commitment to follow-up web-based surveys.
Methods: A group of young women, aged 18-23 years and living in urban
and rural New South Wales, Australia, were recruited to participate in
face-to-face discussions using several methods of recruitment: direct
contact (face-to-face, telephone or email) and snowball sampling by
potential participants inviting their friends. All discussions were
transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis.
Results: Twenty young women participated (urban, n=10: mean age 21.6
years; rural, n=10: 20.0 years) and all used computers or smart phones
to access the internet on a daily basis. All participants were concerned
about the cost of internet access and utilized free access to social
media on their mobile phones. Their willingness to participate in a
web-based survey was dependent on incentives with a preference for small
financial rewards. Most participants were concerned about their personal
details and survey responses remaining confidential and secure. The most
appropriate survey would take up to 15 minutes to complete, be a mix of
short and long questions and eye-catching with bright colours. Questions
on the sensitive topics of sexual activity, contraception and pregnancy
were acceptable if they could respond with ``I prefer not to answer{''}.
Conclusions: There are demographic, participation and survey design
challenges in engaging young women in a web-based survey. Based on our
findings, future research efforts are needed to understand the full
extent of the role social media and incentives play in the decision of
young women to participate in web-based research. (J Med Internet Res

N2  - Based upon the results from extensive building monitoring and surveys on
occupant's behaviors in a representative nine-story apartment building
in northern China, building energy simulations were performed to
evaluate the impacts of integrative retrofits implemented. Integrative
retrofits required by the newer building energy standard produced
significant heating-energy savings (i.e., 53%) when compared with
baseline buildings commonly built in early 1980s. Taking into account
district-heating-system upgrades as part of integrative retrofit
measures, a representative apartment building was 66% more efficient
than the baseline building. Contrary to expectation, little behavioral
change was found in response to the provisions of monetary incentive,
billing-method reform, or metering of heating energy use in individual
apartment units. Yet this paper identified sizable energy savings
potential if occupants' behavioral changes were to actually happen. This
indicates that provisions of financial incentives or individual metering
were insufficient for triggering substantial behavioral changes leading
toward more energy savings in the current buildings. It is recommended
that innovative energy policies, technology upgrades, and education
would be needed to promote behavioral changes toward additional energy
savings. Finally, measures and strategies to further enhance thermal
integrity criteria (e.g., insulations of roof and balcony) are
recommended in China's future building energy policy reforms. (C) 2012

N2  - Purpose
To document the frequency of policies and activities in support of
mentoring practices at institutions receiving a U.S. National Institutes
of Health's Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA).
Method
The study consisted of a 69-item survey with questions about the
inclusion (formal or informal) of policies, activities, and structures
supporting mentoring within CTSA-sponsored research (i.e., KL2 programs)
and, more broadly, in the CTSA's home institution. The survey, conducted
from November 2010 through January 2011, was sent to the 55 institutions
awarded CTSAs at the time of the survey. Follow-up phone interviews were
conducted to clarify responses as needed.
Results
Fifty-one of 55 (92%) institutions completed the survey for
institutional programs and 53 of 55 (96%) for KL2 programs. Responses
regarding policies and activities involving mentor criteria,
mentor-mentee relationship, incentives, and evaluative mechanisms
revealed considerable variability between KL2 and institutional programs
in some areas, such as having mentor qualification criteria and
processes to evaluate mentors. The survey also identified areas, such as
training and women and minority mentoring programs, where there was
frequent sharing of activities between the institutional and KL2
programs.
Conclusions
KL2 programs and institutional programs tend to have different
preferences for policies versus activities to optimize qualification of
mentors, the mentor-mentee relationship, incentives, and evaluation
mechanisms. Frequently, these elements are informal. Individuals in
charge of implementing and maintaining mentoring initiatives can use the
results of the study to consider their current mentoring policies,
structures, and activities by comparing them with national patterns
within CTSA institutions.

N2  - This article is intended to supplement rather than replace earlier
reviews of research on survey incentives, especially those by Singer
(2002); Singer and Kulka (2002); and Cantor, O'Hare, and O'Connor
(2008). It is based on a systematic review of articles appearing since
2002 in major journals, supplemented by searches of the Proceedings of
the American Statistical Association's Section on Survey Methodology for
unpublished papers. The article begins by drawing on responses to
open-ended questions about why people are willing to participate in a
hypothetical survey. It then lays out the theoretical justification for
using monetary incentives and the conditions under which they are
hypothesized to be particularly effective. Finally, it summarizes
research on how incentives affect response rates in cross-sectional and
longitudinal studies and, to the extent information is available, how
they affect response quality, nonresponse error, and cost-effectiveness.
A special section on incentives in Web surveys is included.

N2  - Objectives Applications to run clinical trials in Europe fell 25%
between 2007 and 2011. Costs, speed of approvals and shortcomings of
European Clinical Trial Directive are commonly invoked to explain this
unsatisfactory performance. However, no hard evidence is available on
the actual weight of these factors or has it been previously
investigated whether other criteria may also impact clinical trial site
selection.
Design The Survey of Attitudes towards Trial sites in Europe (SAT-EU
Study) was an anonymous, cross-sectional web-based survey that
systematically assessed factors impacting European clinical trial site
selection. It explored 19 factors across investigator-driven,
hospital-driven and environment-driven criteria, and costs. It also
surveyed perceptions of the European trial environment.
Setting and participants Clinical research organisations (CROs),
academic clinical trial units (CTUs) and industry invited to respond.
Outcome measures Primary outcome: weight assigned to each factor
hypothesised to impact trial site selection and trial incidence.
Secondary outcome: desirability of European countries to run clinical
trials.
Results Responses were obtained from 485 professionals in 34 countries:
49% from BioPharma, 40% from CTUs or CROs. Investigator-dependent,
environment-dependent and hospital-dependent factors were rated highly
important, costs being less important (p<0.0001). Within
environment-driven criteria, pool of eligible patients, speed of
approvals and presence of disease-management networks were significantly
more important than costs or government financial incentives (p<0.0001).
The pattern of response was consistent across respondent groupings (CTU
vs CRO vs industry). Considerable variability was demonstrated in the
perceived receptivity of countries to undertake clinical trials, with
Germany, the UK and the Netherlands rated the best trial markets
(p<0.0001).
Conclusions Investigator-dependent factors and ease of approval dominate
trial site selection, while costs appear less important. Fostering
competitiveness of European clinical research may not require additional
government spending/incentives. Rather, harmonisation of approval
processes, greater visibility of centres of excellence and reduction of
hidden' indirect costs, may bring significantly more clinical trials to
Europe.

N2  - Across the United States, metropolitan areas face challenges related to
transportation and land use. An emerging policy in many regions is to
promote development around higher-density, mixed-use (smart-growth)
centers that create locally accessible nodes; many of these nodes are
also linked to transit stops. Some metropolitan planning organizations
(MPOs) have developed regional plans and incentive programs to encourage
local governments to develop these centers. Incentives include grants as
well as funding criteria in transportation improvement programs (TIP)
that favor projects supporting centers. This paper assesses these
policies as they have been applied in: (1) Puget Sound, Washington; (2)
Portland, Oregon; (3) Denver, Colorado; and (4) San Diego, California.
For the four regions we reviewed documents, conducted 40 interviews with
key individuals, administered an online survey of 450 experts (response
rate = 44 percent), and held a two-day forum involving 40 participants.
We found that incentive policies by themselves were having a limited
impact because they are new and offer small amounts of funding relative
to local government needs and market forces. However, when incentives
are combined with plans, policies, and transit investment, they provide
a significant foundation for promoting growth around centers. There are
a number of ways these policies can be improved, and many policies are
transferable to other metropolitan regions.

N2  - Surveys undergird government statistical systems and social scientific
research throughout the world. Rates of nonresponse are rising in
cross-sectional surveys (those conducted during a fixed period of time
and not repeated). Although this trend worries those concerned with the
validity of survey data, there is no necessary relationship between the
rate of nonresponse and the degree of bias. A high rate of nonresponse
merely creates the potential for bias, but the degree of bias depends on
how factors promoting nonresponse are related to variables of interest.
Nonresponse can be reduced by offering financial incentives to
respondents and by careful design before entering the field, creating a
trade-off between cost and potential bias. When bias is suspected, it
can be countered by weighting individual cases by the inverse of their
response propensity. Response propensities are typically estimated using
a logistic regression equation to predict the dichotomous outcome of
survey participation as a function of auxiliary variables. The
Multi-level Integrated Database Approach employs multiple databases to
collect as much information as possible about the target sample during
the initial sampling stage and at all possible levels of aggregation to
maximize the accuracy of estimated response propensities.

N2  - We present the results of a randomized experiment to test the
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of response incentives for a
stated-preference survey of a general community population. The survey
was administered using a mixed-mode approach, in which community members
were invited to participate using a traditional mailed letter using
contact information for a representative sample of the community; but
individuals completed the survey via the web, which exploited the
advantages of electronic capture. Individuals were randomized to four
incentive groups: (a) no incentive, (b) prepaid cash incentive ($2),
(c) a low lottery (10 prizes of $25) and (d) a high lottery (2 prizes
of $250). Letters of invitation were mailed to 3,000 individuals. In
total, 405 individuals (14.4%) contacted the website and 277 (9.8%)
provided complete responses. The prepaid cash incentive generated the
highest contact and response rates (23.3 and 17.3%, respectively), and
no incentive generated the lowest (9.1 and 5.7%, respectively). The
high lottery, however, was the most cost-effective incentive for
obtaining completed surveys: compared with no incentive, the incremental
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per completed survey for high lottery
was $13.89; for prepaid cash, the ICER was $18.29. This finding
suggests that the preferred response incentive for community-based,
stated-preference surveys is a lottery with a small number of large
prizes.

N2  - Background and objective The acceptability of financial incentives for
organ donation is contentious. This study sought to determine (1) the
acceptability of expense reimbursement or financial incentives by the
general public, health professionals involved with organ donation and
transplantation, and those with or affected by kidney disease and (2)
for the public, whether financial incentives would alter their
willingness to consider donation.
Design, setting, participants, & measurements Web-based survey
administered to members of the Canadian public, health professionals,
and people with or affected by kidney disease asking questions regarding
acceptability of strategies to increase living and deceased kidney
donation and willingness to donate a kidney under various financial
incentives.
Results Responses were collected from 2004 members of the Canadian
public October 11-18,2011; responses from health professionals (n=339)
and people with or affected by kidney disease (n=268) were collected
during a 4-week period commencing October 11, 2011. Acceptability of one
or more financial incentives to increase deceased and living donation
was noted in >70% and 40% of all groups, respectively. Support for
monetary payment for living donors was 45%, 14%, and 27% for the
public, health professionals, and people with or affected by kidney
disease, respectively. Overall, reimbursement of funeral expenses for
deceased donors and a tax break for living donors were the most
acceptable.
Conclusion The general public views regulated financial incentives for
living and deceased donation to be acceptable. Future research needs to
examine the impact of financial incentives on rates of deceased and
living donors. Clin J Am Soc Nephrol 7: 1956-1963, 2012. doi:

N2  - Researchers offer concurrent Web options in mail surveys in hopes of
improving response rates. However, existing literature reports mixed
effects of doing so. This paper utilizes meta-analytic methods to
evaluate the effect that offering a concurrent Web option in a mail
survey has on the response rate. Across nineteen experimental
comparisons, we find that mail surveys that incorporate a concurrent Web
option have significantly lower response rates than those that do not.
We propose several explanations for this result: adding a mode option
may increase the complexity of responding, selecting the Web option
could cause a break in the response process, or attempting to respond
online may result in implementation failure. We also find that study
characteristics, such as offering an incentive, have little influence on
the magnitude of this effect.

N2  - Surveys of cancer patients are an important means of collecting data
necessary to improve cancer prevention and control. However, health
surveys generally are characterized by declining response rates, with
incentives often employed to encourage participation. While successful,
magnitude of effect is partially dependent upon situational
characteristics of respondents, including health status. Given the
health challenges experienced by cancer patients, it is unclear to what
extent incentives can improve survey participation. In this study, we
examine the effectiveness of monetary and non-monetary incentives in
improving response to cancer patient surveys.
We reviewed the available experimental literature regarding efforts to
improve response rates among cancer patients/survivors via incentives.
Relevant studies were identified through searches of the MEDLINE,
PubMed, and PsychINFO databases from 1975 to 2012. Seed sources (e.g.,
Cancer Causes & Control, Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention,
and BMC Medical Research Methodology) were also referenced extensively
in order to establish a comprehensive set of studies.
Although limited, evidence does suggest that token incentives may be
less effective for improving survey participation among cancer patients,
relative to other population groups. These results are contrary to
well-established evidence regarding the efficacy of incentives in
improving survey participation generally. Potential reasons why
incentives may be less effective in this population are explored.
While more research is necessary, results suggest that survey research
strategies targeting cancer patients be purposively designed in a manner
that gives consideration to the distress associated with the condition,
including selection of alternative strategies to improve response.

N2  - Because health care providers have a central role in implementing
guidelines, health care reform, and new standards of care and
technologies, surveying them about their practices and perspectives is
vital for health services and policy research. In November 2010, the
National Cancer Institute convened a workshop to review and discuss
current methodologies in designing and fielding large-scale surveys of
physicians and medical groups. This report summarizes key issues and
future directions for four topic areas addressed in the workshop: sample
frames for surveying physicians and medical groups; points of contact
and response modes; response incentives; and questionnaire design and
burden. Recommendations were made for improving sample frame databases,
optimizing mixed-mode surveys, and studying use of incentives with
gatekeepers and in medical group settings. There is particular need for
empirical assessment of factors that motivate or impede participation of
physicians, other types of clinicians, and medical groups in survey
research.

N2  - Rationale, aims and objectives Unprecedented national and state
initiatives are underway to promote adoption and meaningful use of
electronic health records (EHRs) with health information exchange (HIE).
New York State leads the nation in state initiatives and is conducting
ongoing surveillance of its investments. Lessons learned from studying
states like New York can inform federal policies and will be essential
to evaluate the effectiveness of these initiatives. We undertook this
first in a series of planned surveys to assess EHR adoption and HIE
activities by New York State hospitals.
Methods Between May and December 2009, we surveyed all New York State
hospitals to determine rates of EHR adoption, participation in HIE and
implementation of functionalities associated with nine core meaningful
use criteria.
Results We received responses from 148 (72.2%) of 205 hospitals
surveyed and found that 23 (15.5%) had adopted an EHR and 29 (23.2%)
were participating in HIE. Two hospitals (1.4%) reported full
implementation of the meaningful use functionalities surveyed. Public
hospitals were ahead of private hospitals and notable regional
differences were found.
Discussion EHR adoption rates and participation in HIE are higher among
New York hospitals than hospitals nationwide, suggesting that state
initiatives funding community EHR implementation may influence these
efforts by hospitals. However, overall rates of adoption and
preparedness to meet meaningful use remain low. Direct support for
hospitals, such as that provided through the national EHR Incentive
Program, will likely be critical for rates of EHR adoption and HIE to
significantly rise, even in advanced states.

N2  - Background: Exploring barriers to the uptake of research based
recommendations into practice is an important part of the development of
implementation programmes. Techniques to identify barriers can include
use of theory-informed questionnaires and qualitative interviews.
Conceptualising and measuring theory-informed factors, and engaging
health professionals' to uncover all potential barriers, can be a
difficult task. This paper presents a case study of the process of
trying to identify, systematically, the key factors influencing health
professionals' referrals for women diagnosed with mild to moderate
postnatal depression for psychological treatment. The paper illustrates
how the factors were conceptualised and measured and explores the real
world challenges experienced, with implications for future
implementation studies.
Methods: Theory-informed factors were conceptualised and measured using
a questionnaire and interviews. The questionnaire was piloted, before
being administered to general practitioners, practice nurses and health
visitors working in general practices in one area of the UK NHS. The
interviews were conducted with a small sample of general practitioners
who had not completed the questionnaire, further exploring factors
influencing their referral decisions in the local context.
Results: The response rate to the questionnaire was low (19%), despite
selecting the recommendation to target through engagement with local
stakeholders and surveying local health professionals, and despite using
two reminders, an incentive prize, and phone calls to practice managers
to bolster response rates.
Conclusions: Two significant challenges to achieving higher response
rates and successfully exploring local context were identified: the
difficulties of developing a robust-but feasible-questionnaire to
explore theory-informed factors, and targeting recommendations that are
important to policy makers, but which health professionals view as
unimportant. This case study highlights the ``trade-off{''} between
scientifically rigorous collection of data against the pragmatism and
flexibility requirements of ``real world{''} implementation. Future
implementation studies should explore different ways of identifying
factors influencing the adoption of recommendations to bridge this gulf.

conducted a web-based survey of the California Primary Care
Association's member clinics (response rate 127/181 (70%)). Seventy-two
(59%) clinics had not implemented electronic health records (EHR), 26
(21%) were all electronic, 23 (19%) were both paper and electronic,
and two (2%) had no plans to implement EHR; the remaining four
responses are missing. The majority of clinics allotted less than 6% of
their budget to health information technology and 64% of those planning
on implementing an EHR reported needing additional staff. California's
safety net systems are likely to need additional support to successfully
benefit from health care reform incentives.

smoking cessation policy involving financial incentives.
Methods. We conducted a randomized controlled trial using an
experimental survey design. One of four questionnaire versions was
distributed to participants. Each version described a smoking cessation
treatment costing $750 per success, including an unspecified treatment,
medication, or financial incentive paid to the smoker. Participants
indicated whether they would support a $25 increase in their annual
health insurance premium to pay for the treatment. Questionnaires were
distributed to adults waiting at public transportation depots in
Philadelphia between May and August 2010.
Results. 1010 individuals completed the questionnaires about willingness
to support the policy: 53% female, 27% African-American, 18% current
smokers, and 46% with a household income below $40,000. The response
rate was greater than 50%. Overall support for all smoking cessation
treatments was 41.6%. The financial incentive version received the
lowest support (393%) but that support did not statistically differ
from the treatment (45.8%, p=0.14) or medication (41.7%, p=0.58)
versions.
Conclusions. Financial incentives were perceived no differently than
currently used medications for smoking cessation. Most participants did
not support any smoking cessation treatment options. (C) 2012 Elsevier

N2  - Objective: To develop a research productivity scoring program within an
academic department of surgery that would help realign incentives to
encourage and reward research. Although research is highly valued in the
academic mission, financial incentives are generally aligned to reward
clinical productivity.
Methods: A formula assigning points for publications and extramural
grants was created and used to award a research incentive payment
proportional to the research productivity score, beginning July 2007.
Publication points reflect journal impact factor, author role, and
manuscript type. Grant points reflect total funding and percentage of
effort. Publication data were gathered from Web of
Science/PubMed/Medline and grants data from the departmental grants
office. An annual award is presented to the person with the greatest
improvement. The research productivity score data after July 2007 were
compared with control data for the 2 preceding years. A 33-question
survey to 28 clinical faculty was conducted after the first year to
measure satisfaction and solicit constructive feedback.
Results: The mean annual point scores increased from the preresearch
productivity score to the postresearch productivity score academic years
(2180 vs 3389, respectively, P = .08), with a significant change in the
grant component score (272 vs 801, P = .03). Since research productivity
score implementation, the operative case volumes increased 4.3% from
2006 to 2011. With a response rate of 89%, the survey indicated that
76% of the faculty wished to devote more time to research and 52%
believed 1 or more research-related behaviors would change because of
the research productivity score program.
Conclusions: An objective, transparent research incentive program,
through both monetary incentives and recognition, can stimulate
productivity and was well-received by faculty. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg

N2  - Background: In Germany, family physicians (FPs) are increasingly needed
to participate in undergraduate medical education. Knowledge of FPs'
motivation to teach medical students in their practices is lacking.
Purpose: To describe a novel questionnaire that assesses the motivation
of FPs to teach undergraduates in their practices and to show the
results of a subsequent survey using this instrument.
Methods: The questionnaire was developed based on a review of the
literature. Previously used empirical instruments assessing occupational
values and motivation were included. A preliminary version was pretested
in a pilot study. The resulting 68-item questionnaire was sent to 691
FPs involved in undergraduate medical education. Reliability was
assessed and subgroups were analyzed with regard to differences in
motivation.
Results: A total of 523 physicians in n = 458 teaching practices
participated (response rate 75.7%). `Helping others' and `interest'
were revealed as the predominant motives. Responses showed a
predominantly intrinsic motivation of the participating FPs. Their main
incentives were an ambition to work as a medical preceptor, to generally
improve undergraduate education and to share knowledge. Material
compensation was of minor importance. Time restraints were indicated as
a barrier by some FPs, but were not a general concern.
Conclusion: German FPs involved in medical education have altruistic
attitudes towards teaching medical students in their practices.
Motivational features give an important insight for the recruitment of
FP preceptors as well as for their training in instructional methods.

N2  - Objectives: To determine factors that affect nonparticipation in an
employee diabetes program and factors that may increase participation in
future employee health programs.
Methods: Participants in this cross-sectional study were adults with
type 1 or type 2 diabetes, 18 to 80 years of age, who were covered by
employer insurance but chose not to participate in an employer-sponsored
diabetes program. Potential factors affecting program participation were
assessed through a face-to-face or mailed survey.
Results: Of 204 employees or their dependents eligible for the diabetes
program, 75 (37%) chose not to participate. Among the nonparticipants,
46 (61%) were eligible for this study. A total of 22 surveys were
collected for a 48% response rate. The majority of those individuals
surveyed (91%) were aware of the diabetes program and had been notified
by mail (42%) or phone (29%). Of those surveyed, 33% did not believe
that program incentives had been sufficiently explained to them. Work
schedule was not found to be a determinant of participation. More than
one-half (52%) of responders identified satisfaction with their current
diabetes management as the most notable reason for nonparticipation in
the employee diabetes program.
Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the primary reason for program
nonparticipation was patient satisfaction with current physician
management of their diabetes. In the future, companies offering health
programs should emphasize that the program is being offered to
supplement and complement current disease state management, not to
replace it.

N2  - Background: The 58th World Health Assembly and 56th WHO Regional
Committee for Africa adopted resolutions urging Member States to ensure
that health financing systems included a method for prepayment to foster
financial risk sharing among the population and avoid catastrophic
health-care expenditure. The Regional Committee asked countries to
strengthen or develop comprehensive health financing policies. This
paper presents the findings of a survey conducted among senior staff of
selected Eritrean ministries and agencies to elicit views on some of the
elements likely to be part of a national health financing policy.
Methods: This is a descriptive study. A questionnaire was prepared and
sent to 19 senior staff (Directors) in the Ministry of Health, Labour
Department, Civil Service Administration, Eritrean Confederation of
Workers, National Insurance Corporation of Eritrea and Ministry of Local
Government. The respondents were selected by the Ministry of Health as
key informants.
Results: The key findings were as follows: the response rate was 84.2%
(16/19); 37.5% (6/16) and 18.8% said that the vision of Eritrean
National Health Financing Policy (NHFP) should include the phrases
`equitable and accessible quality health services' and `improve
efficiency or reduce waste' respectively; over 68% indicated that NHFP
should include securing adequate funding, ensuring efficiency, ensuring
equitable financial access, protection from financial catastrophe, and
ensuring provider payment mechanisms create positive incentives to
service providers; over 80% mentioned community participation,
efficiency, transparency, country ownership, equity in access, and
evidence-based decision making as core values of NHFP; over 62.5%
confirmed that NHFP components should consist of stewardship
(oversight), revenue collection, revenue pooling and risk management,
resource allocation and purchasing of health services, health economics
research, and development of human resources for health; over 68.8%
indicated cost-sharing, taxation and social health insurance as
preferred revenue collection mechanisms; and 68.75% indicated their
preferred provider payment mechanism to be a global (lump sum) budget.
Conclusion: This study succeeded in gathering the preliminary views of
senior staff of selected Eritrean ministries and agencies regarding the
likely elements of the NHFP, i.e. the vision, objectives, components,
provider payment mechanisms, and health financing agency and its
governance. In addition to stakeholder surveys, it would be helpful to
inform the development of the NHFP with other pieces of evidence,
including cost-effectiveness analysis of health services and
interventions, financial feasibility analysis of financing options, a
survey of the political and professional acceptability of financing
options, national health accounts, and equity analyses.

N2  - Background: Healthcare professional response rates to postal
questionnaires are declining and this may threaten the validity and
generalisability of their findings.
Methods to improve response rates do incur costs (resources) and
increase the cost of research projects. The aim of these randomised
controlled trials (RCTs) was to assess whether 1) incentives, 2) type of
reminder and/or 3) reduced response burden improve response rates; and
to assess the cost implications of such additional effective
interventions. Methods: Two RCTs were conducted. In RCT A general dental
practitioners (dentists) in Scotland were randomised to receive either
an incentive; an abridged questionnaire or a full length questionnaire.
In RCT B non-responders to a postal questionnaire sent to general
medical practitioners (GPs) in the UK were firstly randomised to receive
a second full length questionnaire as a reminder or a postcard reminder.
Continued non-responders from RCT B were then randomised within their
first randomisation to receive a third full length or an abridged
questionnaire reminder. The cost-effectiveness of interventions that
effectively increased response rates was assessed as a secondary
outcome.
Results: There was no evidence that an incentive (52% versus 43%, Risk
Difference (RD) -8.8 (95%CI -22.5, 4.8); or abridged questionnaire
(46% versus 43%, RD -2.9 (95%CI -16.5, 10.7); statistically
significantly improved dentist response rates compared to a full length
questionnaire in RCT A. In RCT B there was no evidence that a full
questionnaire reminder statistically significantly improved response
rates compared to a postcard reminder (10.4% versus 7.3%, RD 3 (95%
CI -0.1, 6.8). At a second reminder stage, GPs sent the abridged
questionnaire responded more often (14.8% versus 7.2%, RD -7.7 (95%
CI -12.8, -2.6). GPs who received a postcard reminder followed by an
abridged questionnaire were most likely to respond (19.8% versus 6.3%,
RD 8.1%, and 9.1% for full/postcard/full, three full or
full/full/abridged questionnaire respectively). An abridged
questionnaire containing fewer questions following a postcard reminder
was the only cost-effective strategy for increasing the response rate
(15.99 pound per response).
Conclusions: When expecting or facing a low response rate to postal
questionnaires, researchers should carefully identify the most efficient
way to boost their response rate. In these studies, an abridged
questionnaire containing fewer questions following a postcard reminder
was the only cost-effective strategy. An increase in response rates may
be explained by a combination of the number and type of contacts.
Increasing the sampling frame may be more cost-effective than
interventions to prompt non-responders. However, this may not strengthen
the validity and generalisability of the survey findings and affect the
representativeness of the sample.

N2  - Study Objective: The current study presents findings from a qualitative
examination of free text comments from a national survey of U.S.
physicians on human papillomavirus vaccine recommendation beliefs and
practices. Qualitative analyses of free text physician responses may
offer a more complete and physician-driven description of influences on
human papillomavirus vaccine recommendation.
Design and Participants: In 2009, a survey assessing physicians'
knowledge, attitudes, and human papillomavirus vaccination practices was
conducted among a national sample of U.S. physicians practicing Family
Medicine, Pediatrics, or Obstetrics/Gynecology (response rate 67.8%).
Qualitative comments were analyzed using a Grounded Theory approach.
Results: Of 1008 completed surveys, 112 participants provided comments,
which were organized into three primary HPV vaccine-related themes: (a)
comments about cost of the vaccine, (b) comments about institutional
policies and procedures, and (c) physicians' personal views and one
secondary theme related to survey methodology: the parent study's use of
an upfront cash incentive. Many comments pertained to issues that were
queried in the closed-end survey items; however, some comments provided
insight into understudied areas (e.g., physician attitudes regarding
survey methodology).
Conclusion: Physician respondents used the free text space to
reemphasize issues that were most important to them and to offer insight
about aspects of the vaccine and the survey process.

N2  - Introduction: Tobacco use is responsible for a considerable portion of
the health disparities experienced by Blacks. In addition to its
physiological effects, tobacco use has consistently been shown to be
associated with suicidality among adolescents. The purpose of the
present study is to describe the association between specific patterns
of tobacco use behavior and those of suicidality among a nationally
representative sample of Black high school students.
Methods: Responses from Black adolescents (N = 2,931) who completed the
2007 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey were included. Latent class
analysis was utilized to identify typologies based on two domains: (a)
lifetime and recent tobacco use and (b) suicidality. The association
between tobacco use class membership and suicidality class membership as
well as the direct effects of age and gender on class membership was
also investigated.
Results: A significant proportion of Black youth reported smoking and
suicidal behaviors. A 4-class model provided the best overall fit to the
data for tobacco use behavior (nonsmokers, former smokers, light current
smokers, and frequent current smokers); a 3-class model provided the
best overall fit to the data for suicidality (not suicidal, mild
suicidality, suicidal). Smoking status was associated with suicidality
class membership, with more intense patterns of smoking related to
increased probability of identification with both mild suicidality and
being classified as suicidal compared with not suicidal.
Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that any current smoking
status increases the likelihood of suicidality at least 5-fold and
provides incentive to target this specific portion of the population of
Black adolescent smokers.

b) examine factors associated with acceptability; and c) examine
preferred levels of incentive amounts.
Methods. A cross-sectional touch screen computer survey was conducted
between February and October 2010 in New South Wales, Australia.
Participants were clients experiencing financial or social hardship and
receiving emergency welfare aid from a non-government social and
community service organisation.
Results. Of 383 participants (69% response rate), 46% believed
personal financial incentives were an excellent/good idea, 47% believed
personal financial incentives did more good than harm and 61% agreed
they would motivate smokers to quit. High acceptability ratings were
associated with participants being female, current smokers, living in
low socioeconomic areas, experiencing smoking-induced deprivation,
making a previous quit attempt and intending to quit in the next 6
months. When asked what amount of incentive they felt would be
acceptable, 23% selected amounts between $50 and $500AUD and 37%
selected amounts over $500AUD.
Conclusions. Given high smoking prevalence among socially disadvantaged
groups and consequent health disparities, it is imperative novel methods
of encouraging smoking cessation are explored and tested. This survey
found financial incentives may be an acceptable method. Further research
to understand all possible positive and negative effects is warranted.

N2  - Introduction: The shortage of physicians in rural areas of the USA has
led medical schools to focus on recruiting and selecting students who
will choose to work in non-urban settings. The purpose of this study was
to examine the effect of student characteristics previously correlated
to choosing rural practice (ie being older, being male, being raised in
a rural community, having a spouse or significant other who was raised
in a rural community, having a spouse or significant other whose parents
live in a rural community, having parents with high school education or
less, and graduating from a smaller college) on osteopathic medical
students' intent to practice in a rural setting. This study also
examined the correlation between personality type and intent for rural
practice using the Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). Finally, this
study examined factors that would increase interest in practicing in a
rural setting, such as financial assistance and students' opinions about
physicians who choose to practice in rural areas.
Methods: The study participants were students in a new osteopathic
medical school with an enrollment of 225. Cross-sectional survey data
were collected on background characteristics and intent for rural
practice. Retrospective data were collected from MBTI assessments
previously completed as part of routine career planning educational
sessions. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics such as
frequencies, percentages and inferential statistics such as chi(2) and
logistic regression.
Results: A total of 141 students participated, a 63% response rate.
Factors associated with intent to practice rural medicine included being
raised in a rural area for more than half of one's life (p<0.0 5) and
having a spouse or significant other who had lived in a rural area
(p<0.0 5). Age, sex, race, and size of undergraduate college were not
associated with intent to practice rural medicine. Students categorized
as Extraverted based on the MBTI were more likely to have intent for
rural practice even when other factors were controlled. Students
reported that financial incentives and wage guarantees may increase
interest in rural practice.
Conclusion: The results of this study support past research showing that
medical students with a rural background and with spouses or significant
others having a rural background are more likely to have intent for
rural practice. This study also found that students' personality types
may be correlated with intent to practice in a rural area. In order to
provide physicians who will serve the population living in rural areas
of the USA, it is imperative that medical schools select students who
are most likely to practice in a non-urban setting. Financial incentives
are important to students, suggesting that programs such as loan
forgiveness may be useful in recruiting students to rural practice.
Medical students may benefit from career counseling utilizing the MBTI
to facilitate an understanding of personality type and how it may impact
their preference for rural practice.

N2  - Background: A founding principle of hospice is that the patient and
family is the unit of care; however, we lack national information on
services to family members. Although Medicare certification requires
bereavement services be provided, reimbursement rates are not tied to
the level or quality of care; therefore, limited financial incentives
exist for hospice to provide more than a minimal benefit.
Objectives: To assess the scope and intensity of services provided to
family members by hospice.
Research Design: We fielded a national survey of hospices between
September 2008 and November 2009.
Participants: A national sample of US hospices with an 84% response
rate (N=591).
Measures: Bereavement services to the family, bereavement services to
the community, labor-intensive family services, and comprehensive family
services.
Results: Most hospices provided bereavement services to the family
(78%) and to the community (76%), but only a minority of hospices
provided labor-intensive (23%) or comprehensive (27%) services to
grieving family members. Larger hospice size was positively and
significantly associated with each of the 4 measures of family services.
We found no significant difference in provision of bereavement services
to the family, labor-intensive services, or comprehensive services by
ownership type; however, nonprofit hospices were more likely than
for-profit hospices to provide bereavement services to the community.
Conclusions: Our results show substantial diversity in the scope and
intensity of services provided to families of patients with terminal
illnesses, suggesting a need for clearer guidance on what hospices
should provide to exemplify best practices. Consensus within the field
on more precise guidelines in this area is essential.

N2  - In the United States, multipartnered fertility (MPF) has become
commonplace. This study provides the first nationally representative
measures of women's MPF, across multiple years, using the U.S. Census
Bureau's Surveys of Income and Program Participation. Because welfare
rules contain strong incentives for MPF, and because MPF is especially
common among welfare recipients, the authors also examine the
relationship between welfare and MPF. Focusing on the pre-TANF period
1985 to 1996, when welfare rules were more comparable across states and
the absence of time limits made the incentives for MPF larger, the
authors find little behavioral response. Among low-income mothers, MPF
does not appear to be driven by program design. Because the incentives
were relatively large and reached well up the income distribution, the
findings amplify those of earlier studies that show little demographic
response to antipoverty programs and invite reconsideration of how much
these incentives should constrain transfer programs that target
children.

N2  - Background: The participation of trainers and trainees in health
research is critical to advance medical science. Overcoming barriers and
enhancing incentives are essential to sustain a research culture and
extend the frontiers of medical education. In this study, we
investigated the roles of individual and system factors influencing
trainee resident participation in health research in Enugu,
south-eastern Nigeria.
Methods: This cross-sectional survey of trainee residents was conducted
across three residency training centres in Enugu, Nigeria, between
February and March, 2010. The number and speciality distribution of
trainee residents were determined from personnel records at each centre.
A 19-item questionnaire was used to record demographic characteristics,
research training/experience, and attitudes toward and perceived
barriers to health research. Data were analysed to yield frequencies,
percentages and proportions. Values of p < 0.05 were considered
significant.
Results: The response rate was 93.2%. The respondents (n = 136)
comprised 109 males and 27 females. Their mean +/- standard deviation
age was 35.8 +/- 5.6 years (range: 25-53 years). Participation in
research was significantly associated with previous research training
{[}odds ratio (OR): 2.90; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.35-6.25, p =
0.003, beta = 22.57], previous research participation (OR: 2.21; 95%
CI: 0.94-5.29, p = 0.047, beta = 22.53) and research publication (OR:
2.63; 95% CI: 1.00-7.06, p = 0.03, beta = 22.57). Attitude towards
research was significantly influenced by perceived usefulness of
research in patient care (OR: 7.10; 95% CI: 3.33-15.13, p = 0.001), job
promotion (OR: 8.97; 95% CI: 4.12-19.53, p = 0.001) and better
understanding of disease (OR: 21.37; 95% CI: 8.71-54.44, p = 0.001).
Time constraints (OR: 0.06; 95% CI = 0.025-0.14, p = 0.001), funding
(OR: 0.028; 95% CI: 0.008-0.10, p = 0.001) and mentorship (OR: 0.086;
95% CI: 0.36-0.21, p = 0.001) were significant barriers to research
participation.
Conclusions: System and individual factors are significant incentives to
research participation, while system-derived factors are significant
barriers. Pre-residency research, dedicated research time, adequate
research funding and commensurate research mentorship rewards are
instructive. Prospective longitudinal studies are warranted to confirm
these findings.

N2  - Aim: The study aims to describe the meal time and parent communication
practices used in South Australian Long Day Care Centres (LDCCs) and
explore whether practices differ by engagement in a nutrition incentive
award scheme, Start Right-Eat Right. Methods: One hundred eighty-four
staff from South Australian LDCCs (81% response rate) completed a
16-item telephone survey. Open and closed questions were asked, with
multiple unprompted responses accepted for open questions. Differences
by Start Right-Eat Right status (engaged vs not-engaged) were determined
using chi-square analysis. Results: Sitting and supervising children
while eating (100%), offering meals (98%) and snacks (94%) at regular
and predictable intervals, and discussing food served with children
(88%) were common mealtime practices. Practices that involved children
at mealtimes were also frequent. Engaged centres reported higher
frequencies of staff role modelling (80% vs 56%, P= 0.004) and
encouraging children to taste foods offered (33% vs 13%, P= 0.021).
Centres reported using sometimes foods (76%) and food alternatives
(42%) to celebrate children's birthdays, with more engaged centres than
not-engaged centres using nutritious foods at celebrations (15% vs 6%,
P= 0.045). While 59% of respondents indicated that nutrition can be a
sensitive topic to discuss with families, over 90% indicated it is
important to communicate with parents about nutrition and felt confident
to do so. Conclusion: Practices employed by South Australian LDCCs to
create a positive mealtime environment were consistent with current
guidelines, more so when centres are engaged in a nutrition award
scheme.

N2  - This article seeks empirical evidence of how the Finnish electricity
distribution companies have responded to regulatory incentives in the
rate of return regulation. The effects of regulation on company
behaviour were studied by a questionnaire and interview survey. After
more than ten years of regulation, the results show that the investment,
operation and pricing behaviour of companies have been influenced by
regulatory incentives, but the future role of regulation is expected to
be even greater. Regulatory incentives were recognised by the companies,
but the role of other drivers such as customer value was considered
strong. Public companies reported stronger response to regulatory
incentives. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - The need to adapt to climate change impacts, whilst simultaneously
limiting greenhouse gas emissions, requires that the government's
efforts are joined by public action. In England and Wales, housing
contributes significantly to the emissions and many properties are at
risk of flooding. This paper investigates the preparedness of homeowners
in England and Wales to make changes to their homes in response to the
predicted effects of climate change. A telephone survey of 961
homeowners investigated their interest in purchasing mitigation and
adaptation improvements against their concern about climate change,
awareness of flood risk and attribution of responsibility for action.
Whilst the majority of homes had some energy-saving improvements, few
were found to have property-level flood protection. The high levels of
awareness about climate change and flooding were coupled with the
perception of risks as low. Whilst some respondents accepted personal
responsibility for action, most believed that the authorities were
responsible for flood protection, and would not pay the costs required
to make their home more energy-efficient and better prepared for the
eventuality of floods. The results suggest that there is scope for
further improvement of energy-saving measures, and that the levels of
adoption of flood-protection measures are very low. Multi-faceted
strategies, including more effective communication of risks and
responsibilities, incentives, and material support for the poorest, will
need to be developed to overcome the current reluctance by homeowners to
invest in flood-protection measures and further energy conservation
solutions in the future.

N2  - Consumer ethnocentrism presents barriers for internationalising
organisations. In China, evidence of a resurgent nationalism partly
fuelled by rapid economic growth portends a shift in consumption away
from foreign towards domestic products. On the other hand, rising
consumer demand for branded and luxury products cannot be fully met
domestically. However, much of the available evidence on Chinese
consumer ethnocentrism is anecdotal and is based on attitudinal surveys
that, as accurate measures of actual purchasing behaviour, suffer from
certain methodological issues. In response, we report an experiment that
measures the ethnocentrism of 447 Chinese consumers as their
incentive-compatible choices between foreign and domestic products in a
field setting. Our findings show little effect of foreign origin on
subjects' choices that were only weakly related with attitudinal
measures including the commonly used consumer ethnocentric tendencies
scale (CETSCALE). Our results question the existence of ethnocentric
consumer behaviour in China and the use of CETSCALE to gauge it
generally. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - On-board survey is one of the most common survey methods utilized on
transit units like buses to obtain vital information regarding customer
trip characteristics, travel behavior, demographic characteristics, and
customers' attitude toward services. The quantity and the quality of
data collected through on-board surveys are very critical and often are
a major concern for transit systems because survey results are used for
current or future route planning, modeling, etc. Thus, applying
appropriate survey techniques for on-board surveys is crucial to
collecting the required amount of data to fulfill the transit system's
current and future needs without survey cost and time overruns. This
study tested three different on-board survey techniques to
quantitatively evaluate the effects of each technique on the overall
response rate and unit cost. These three tests are (a) length of
questionnaire, (b) incentives, and (c) surveyors. The tests were
conducted on selected routes of the Tulsa Transit System. The test
results indicate that different combinations of techniques will result
in different response rates and unit costs. Thus, good planning and
piloting tests for the different on-board survey techniques, and
appropriate interpretations of the pilot test results, are crucial to
acquiring the expected performance of the main survey while staying
within budget. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - From 2009 to 2010, an experiment was conducted to increase response
rates among African American mothers in the Wisconsin Pregnancy Risk
Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS). Sample members were randomly
assigned to groups that received a prepaid, cash incentive of $5 (n =
219); a coupon for diapers valued at $6 (n = 210); or no incentive (n =
209). Incentives were included with the questionnaire, which was mailed
to respondents. We examined the effects of the incentives on several
outcomes, including response rates, cost effectiveness, survey response
distributions, and item nonresponse. Response rates were significantly
higher for the cash group than for the coupon (42.5 vs. 32.4%, P < .05)
or no incentive group (42.5 vs. 30.1%, P < .01); the coupon and no
incentive groups performed similarly. While absolute costs were the
highest for the cash group, the cost per completed survey was the
lowest. The incentives had limited effects on response distributions for
specific survey questions. Although respondents completing the survey by
mail in the cash and coupon groups exhibited a trend toward being less
likely to have missing data, the effect was not significant. Compared to
a coupon or no incentive, a small cash incentive significantly improved
response rates and was cost effective among African American respondents
in Wisconsin PRAMS. Incentives had only limited effects, however, on
survey response distributions, and no significant effects on item
nonresponse.

N2  - Wrist, hand, and finger trauma are the most common injuries presenting
to emergency departments. Shortage of emergency hand care is an emerging
problem, as on-call hand coverage declines. This study evaluates the
availability of elective and emergency hand surgery services in
Tennessee, with the use of telephone surveys administered to emergency
department and operating facility management. One hundred eleven
Tennessee hospitals completed the surveys (93% response rate). In all,
77% of hospitals offer elective hand surgery, 58% offer basic
emergency hand services, 18% offer occasional hand specialist call
coverage and only 7% of hospitals have 24/7 hand specialist call
coverage. Hospitals with hand specialists have significantly more payer
charges from commercial insurance than hospitals without hand
specialists (26.1% vs. 16.1%, P < 0.001). Our results strongly support
the need for increased emergency hand coverage. Solutions include
creating multihospital coordinated call schedules, increasing incentives
for call coverage, and training more hand specialists.

N2  - Background: The quality of data collected in survey research is usually
indicated by the response rate; the representativeness of the sample,
and; the rate of completed questions (item-response). In attempting to
improve a generally declining response rate in surveys considerable
efforts are being made through follow-up mailings and various types of
incentives. This study examines effects of including a scratch lottery
ticket in the invitation letter to a survey.
Method: Questionnaires concerning oral health were mailed to a random
sample of 2,400 adults. A systematically selected half of the sample
(1,200 adults) received a questionnaire including a scratch lottery
ticket. One reminder without the incentive was sent.
Results: The incentive increased the response rate and improved
representativeness by reaching more respondents with lower education.
Furthermore, it reduced item nonresponse. The initial incentive had no
effect on the propensity to respond after the reminder.
Conclusion: When attempting to improve survey data, three issues become
important: response rate, representativeness, and item-response. This
study shows that including a scratch lottery ticket in the invitation
letter performs well on all the three.

HACCP accredited meat processing plants, all across the country. A total
of 105 complete responses were selected for analysis. The results were
as follows: approximately 60% of the respondents employed less than
twenty workers. The average period of operating HACCP system was 3.4
years. The respondents replied that the major incentive to implement the
HACCP system was to improve hygiene management ability. More than half
of the respondents (59.05%) claimed that the implementation of the
HACCP system cost less than 400 million won, and the highest investment
in terms of cost was the freezer/refrigerator. In the preparation period
taken to implement the HACCP system, the 6-12 mon category had the
highest percentage (55.24%). Most respondents replied that there was an
increase in the customer satisfaction, plant image and turnover, after
HACCP implementation (p<0.05). A total of 98.09% of respondents had the
opinion that their plant workers had improved in their understanding of
food hygiene by HACCP implementation (p<0.05). Approximately 79% of
respondents indicated that customer complaints decreased, as a result of
HACCP implementation.

N2  - It is often of interest to elicit beliefs from populations that may
include nave participants. Unfortunately, elicitation mechanisms are
typically assessed by assuming optimal responses to incentives. Using
laboratory experiments with a population that potentially includes nave
participants, we compare the performance of two elicitation mechanisms
proposed by Karni (Econometrica 77(2):603-606, 2009). These mechanisms,
denoted as ``declarative{''} and ``clock,{''} are valuable because their
incentive compatibility does not require strong assumptions such as risk
neutrality or expected utility maximization. We show that, theoretically
and empirically, with a sufficient fraction of nave participants, the
clock mechanism elicits beliefs more accurately than the declarative.
The source of this accuracy advantage is twofold: the clock censors nave
responses, and participants are more likely to employ dominant
strategies under the clock. Our findings hold practical value to anyone
interested in eliciting beliefs from representative populations, a goal
of increasing importance when conducting large-scale surveys or field
experiments.

N2  - Private landowners play a pivotal role in determining whether or not
rare species persist in regions where privately owned land is extensive.
The range of the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) is confined to
the Southeastern U.S., a region predominantly under private ownership,
and thus the status of this species is largely dependent upon land
management decisions made by private landowners. We sent an anonymous
mail survey to 2,584 individuals to examine factors affecting gopher
tortoise occurrence on private lands in Mississippi (adjusted response
rate of 23%). Few respondents (19%) reported currently having
tortoises on their property, although many had them in the past (30%).
Tortoises were persisting primarily on larger properties with longleaf
pine that were not managed chiefly for timber production. In general,
respondents were largely unaware of habitat requirements of tortoises or
effects of various land management practices on them, and few reported
using management techniques that benefit tortoises, such as prescribed
burning. Most respondents (57%) knew of wildlife incentive programs,
but were hesitant to enroll because they did not want to commit to
managing their property in a particular manner (34%). We suggest
actions that could improve the likelihood of tortoise persistence in
this region, as well as changes that could be made to incentive programs
to increase landowner participation. These suggestions should be
relevant to the conservation of other rare species on private lands in
other regions.

N2  - Stewardship programs providing financial incentives for conservation on
private lands are increasingly common. We estimate the potential costs
of a stewardship program in the Daly River catchment, Northern
Territory, which would underwrite the cost difference between routine
land management and the additional requirements of conservation
management on grazing properties. Based on survey responses from
landholders, we first assess the current costs of land management in the
catchment and use regression to identify key drivers of spatial
variation in both routine land management costs and
conservation-oriented management costs. We define conservation-oriented
management costs as the costs required to meet objectives for both
routine property management and conservation. We then estimate the
additional costs of conservation management over and above routine land
management at an average of $1.99 per ha. We conclude that, if the most
cost-effective properties are targeted, an annual budget of $1 million
would support stewardship agreements covering 90% of the catchment's
area. Much of the cost-effectiveness of stewardship payments would come
from the significant economies of scale in managing large pastoral
properties and leveraging the costs of routine land management already
met by landholders. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Physician surveys are an important tool to assess attitudes,
beliefs and self-reported behaviors of this policy relevant group. In
order for a physician to respond to a mailed survey, they must first
open the envelope. While there is some evidence that package elements
can impact physician response rates, the impact of an envelope teaser is
unknown. Here we assess this by testing the impact of adding a brightly
colored ``$25 incentive{''} sticker to the outside of an envelope on
response rates and nonresponse bias in a survey of physicians.
Methods: In the second mailing of a survey assessing physicians' moral
beliefs and views on controversial health care topics, initial
nonrespondents were randomly assigned to receive a survey in an envelope
with a colored ``$25 incentive{''} sticker (teaser group) or an
envelope without a sticker (control group). Response rates were compared
between the teaser and control groups overall and by age, gender, region
of the United States, specialty and years in practice. Nonresponse bias
was assessed by comparing the demographic composition of the respondents
to the nonrespondents in the experimental and control condition.
Results: No significant differences in response rates were observed
between the experimental and control conditions overall (p = 0.38) or
after stratifying by age, gender, region, or practice type. Within the
teaser condition, there was some variation in response rate by years
since graduation. There was no independent effect of the teaser on
response when simultaneously controlling for demographic characteristics
(OR = 0.875, p = 0.4112).
Conclusions: Neither response rates nor nonresponse bias were impacted
by the use of an envelope teaser in a survey of physicians in the United

Design. Cross-sectional survey of 89 PCPs participating in a joint
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF)-Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality (AHRQ) health promotion initiative.
Setting and Participants. 100% response rate from PCPs participating in
the RWJF-AHRQ
Measures. Survey data on cessation counseling, practice involvement with
P4P, practice size, public reporting of performance, practice
competition, linkages with community resources, integration of
evidence-based guidelines, patient recommendations for cessation, and
state-specific smoking rates.
Analysis. Logistic regression was used to examine associations between
practice involvement with P4P and cessation counseling offered by PCPs.
Practice characteristics, including size and availability of other
cessation services, were included in the analysis.
Results. Practices that were involved with P4P had greater odds of
offering recommended cessation counseling (odds ratio {[}OR] = 27.6, p <
.01). Practices that linked patients to community resources, experienced
greater competition, and were larger in size also provided more
counseling (p < .05). Publicly reporting performance information and
being located in states with higher smoking rates were associated with
decreased odds of offering counseling support (p < .10).
Conclusions. Findings suggest that P4P is associated with recommended
counseling for smoking cessation. Study limitations include small sample
size and unavailability of information on the magnitude of P4P
incentives and program design. Further analysis considering these
programmatic details is warranted. (Am J Health Promot

N2  - Purpose: This study examined the current prevalence of electronic health
records (EHRs) in Korea and identified the factors that impede or
facilitate the adoption of EHRs.
Methods: We surveyed all tertiary teaching and general hospitals in
Korea. The degree to which EHR systems were adopted was evaluated using
the previously defined definitions of `comprehensive' and `basic' EHRs
based on their electronic functionality. The effects of teaching status,
size, and location of hospitals on EHR adoption were examined. We also
investigated factors that impeded or facilitated the adoption of EHR
systems.
Results: The response rate was 39.0% (122/313), and 37.2% (95%
confidence interval {[}CI] 31.9-42.6%) of Korean tertiary teaching and
general hospitals had either basic or comprehensive EHR systems (50.2%
of tertiary teaching hospitals, 35.0% of general hospitals). However,
only 5.0% (CI 2.6-7.4%) had comprehensive EHR systems. Most Korean
tertiary teaching and general hospitals, i.e., 87.0% (95% CI,
83.3-90.7%), have implemented computerized provider order-entry (CPOE)
systems for medications, with larger hospitals more likely than smaller
ones to have adopted some sort of EHRs (p-value < 0.001). However, the
prevalence of these systems did not differ according to the location of
the hospital (metropolitan vs. non-metropolitan). According to the
survey data, the capital requirements and high maintenance costs of EHR
systems were the major barriers to their adoption, and government
reimbursement or incentives were the most requested facilitators of
their adoption.
Conclusion: The rate at which EHR and CPOE for medications systems have
been adopted by Korean tertiary teaching and general hospitals was
higher than the rate of adoption by US hospitals. Financial aspects are
reported to be the most important facilitators of and barriers to EHR
adoption. Government financial support, especially to small hospitals,
seems to be essential to promoting the adoption of EHRs by Korean
hospitals. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

profiles of patients awaiting magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at a
private and at a hospital-based facility, and hypothesized that they
would not differ significantly.
Methods: A survey of patients attending a hospital facility and a
privately owned venue in an Ontario city. Descriptive, bivariate, and
logistic regression analyses were performed.
Results: A total of 314 patients provided data, with a higher response
rate at the private clinic than at the hospital-based clinic (97% vs
60%). For the majority of patients (58%), the MRI was scheduled to
follow up known disease; 55.8% waited more than 4 weeks; 6.4% waited
more than 6 months. One-third of patients expressed a willingness to
travel to the United States and pay for the MRI, 41% expressed a
willingness to pay within Ontario, and 66% were willing to travel
elsewhere in Ontario. They were more likely to be at the hospital-based
MRI if they were being followed up for known disease and had a diagnosis
of cancer, whereas those patients at the private MRI facility reported
significantly more pain; 59% of the hospital-based sample and 72% of
the private clinic sample reported significantly reduced quality of life
because of their health problem.
Discussion: These data provide interesting insights into the
characteristics of patients awaiting an MRI and the attitudes of
patients towards public and private MRI clinics. There were significant
attitudinal differences between those patients attending the 2
facilities. Pain, coupled with a long wait, may create an incentive for
patients to conclude that private clinics should be permitted if the
hospital environment is unable to improve access times.

letter was sent, and whether or not a $10 incentive was provided. The
results indicate that providing a monetary incentive substantially
increased response rates over the no incentive condition and that
principals were more likely to respond to a paper-based survey than a

N2  - Disposal of sputum from patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) who
are treated at home is an important aspect of preventing the spread of
TB. However, few studies have examined disposal of sputum by patients
with TB who are treated at home. Patients with pulmonary TB who are
treated at home were surveyed regarding sputum handling and supervision.
A cross-sectional survey of a representative sample of patients with
pulmonary TB who are treated at home was conducted in Shandong Province.
Participants were individuals with TB who had been registered with a
local agency responsible for TB control. Participants completed a
questionnaire with both qualitative and quantitative questions. How
sputum was handled was determined and factors associated with sputum
disposal were analyzed using a non-parametric test, logistic regression,
and content analysis. Responses were received from 720 participants.
Patients expectorated sputum 4.56 +/- 10.367 times a day, and 68.6% of
patients responded that they correctly disposed of their sputum.
Supervision as part of TB control focused on the efforts of health
agencies and paid little attention to waste management by patients. A
non-parametric test showed that sputum disposal was significantly
associated with gender, age, education, sputum smear results, attitudes
toward waste management, and attitudes toward supervision (all p <
0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that gender (OR = 0.482, 95%
CI: 0.329-0.704), sputum smear results (OR = 1.300, 95% CI:
1.037-1.629), and level of education (OR = 0.685, 95% CI: 0.528-0.889)
were associated with receipt of TB health education (all p < 0.05).
Sputum handling by and supervision of patients with pulmonary TB who are
treated at home is severely wanting. From a policy perspective, special
attention should be given to the definition, details, and methods of
supervision of waste management by patients with TB to give them
relevant health education and enhance their willingness to be
supervised. A financial incentive should be provided to health workers
supervising management of TB-related waste.

N2  - The extent of openness to international trade may alter incentives
differentially by gender for labor force participation, particularly in
economies in which gender differentials in human capital investments
such as schooling are large and in which norms about gender behaviors
are strong. This paper uses historical census data since 1951 and two
recent Labor Force Surveys to investigate the impact of international
trade openness on gender differences in labor force participation rates
in broad occupational categories in Pakistan. The method used controls
for average gender differences in these occupational categories and the
unobserved factors that affect male and female labor force participation
rates equally. The estimates indicate that increased international trade
significantly reduces the gap between male and female labor force
participation on average across all occupations. However, if responses
are allowed to vary across seven broad occupational categories, the
estimates suggest that the significant relative increases in female
labor force participation are concentrated in agriculture and other
primary occupations.

N2  - Purpose - Environmental sustainability literature provides extensive
evidence that business organizations, societies, and governments all
have a stake in green operations management. Despite the importance of a
firm's effort to alleviate environmental damages and provide economic
benefits to organizations, little is known about the external
institutional drivers that enable firms to adopt internal proactive
environmental strategies. This purpose of this study is to examine the
extent to which an internal proactive environmental strategy
(eco-design) and external institutional drivers (government regulations
and incentives, customer pressures) motivate firms to adopt eco-deigns
that influence environmental performance.
Design/methodology/approach - Hypotheses are tested using data from a
sample of 132 EMS ISO 14001 - certified manufacturing firms in Malaysia.
Specifically, this study uses survey data to validate the major premises
in our proposed model.
Findings - Empirical tests of the hypotheses with structural equation
modeling (SEM) support the posited explanation that external
institutional drivers influence a firm's environmental performance both
directly and indirectly through its internal proactive environmental
strategy. These findings extend prior research by establishing the
importance of the relationships among regulations/incentives, customer
pressures, eco-designs, and environmental performance.
Research limitations/implications - Although the research design
incorporates extensive literature reviews, it does not capture every
aspect of underlying constructs characteristics. Future efforts should
establish a valid, reliable instrument for these constructs.
Practical implications - This research provides rigorous empirical
support of the contribution of eco-design to environmental performance.
This finding helps managers recognize how to leverage their internally
developed eco-designs capabilities by responding to external pressures
and institutional concerns. The response to external institutional
pressures provides a basis for creating an inimitable eco-design
resource base, which is critical to environmental sustainability.
Originality/value - This study examines a key factor, eco-design, that
may transmit the influence of regulations/incentives and customer
pressures to firm's environmental performance. The findings provide
strong support for the main thesis, as well as valuable insights about
predictors of firm environmental performance.

N2  - Children with special health care needs pose a special challenge in
post-disaster response. Current research suggests that the general
population is not adequately prepared for a major disaster event, with
members of vulnerable populations even less prepared. The purpose of
this study was to determine the short-term effectiveness of a brief
patient education intervention aimed at increasing levels of disaster
preparedness among families of special health care needs children. One
hundred twenty-one families were randomly assigned to either
intervention or intervention plus incentive group. Families were
surveyed prior to the intervention using a previously published
instrument on family preparedness, and at 30-45 days post-intervention.
A Preparedness Score was assigned to each family based on the number of
items completed on the preparedness instrument. Significant differences
were found between pre- and posttest scores for families that received
the intervention, regardless of whether or not an incentive item was
provided. Posttest scores were significantly higher than pretest scores,
suggesting that the intervention was successful in increasing short-term
overall levels of family preparedness in this population.

N2  - Purpose: Part 2 of this survey reports on the 2009 survey findings
distributed to the deans of US dental schools. A national, electronic
survey of 58 dental school deans was distributed by e-mail to evaluate
an interest in specialty training, an interest in specialty training in
prosthodontics, faculty shortage issues, predoctoral curriculum in
prosthodontics, ideology regarding dental specialties, and the
administrative position of prosthodontics within the schools.
Materials and Methods: The survey data were transferred to an online
spreadsheet program for statistical analysis (Key Survey, Inc.
www.keysurvey.com, Braintree, MA). The opinions of dental school deans
were viewed as legitimate indicators of change within predoctoral and
postdoctoral prosthodontic education. Statistical analysis was carried
out using Statistica Version 9.1 (Statsoft, Tulsa, OK).
Results: Of the 58 deans, 42 deans responded, for a 72.4% response
rate. Twenty-three deans reported an increase in the number of students
seeking specialty training after dental school. Only three deans
reported a decrease in those seeking specialty training. In the 2009
survey, 45% the deans responded that there was an increased interest in
prosthodontics. One or more open faculty positions in prosthodontics
existed at 24 (59%) of the dental schools, and 30 (71%) offered at
least one incentive or a variety of incentives to recruit faculty. The
2009 respondents to the deans' survey revealed predoctoral student
exposure to prosthodontists was high, and exposure to advanced education
in prosthodontics students was low. A survey of internal school programs
that might have an impact on an increased interest in prosthodontics
revealed the presence of a predoctoral mentoring program for
prosthodontics in 36 (88%) of the institutions. The clinical curriculum
included treatment of a variety of cases including complex cases as
defined by a diagnostic classification system. The 2009 survey
respondents reported an increase in the number of schools where
prosthodontics is a separate entity or department.
Conclusion: Deans reported an increased interest in prosthodontics in
the 2009 survey. Open faculty positions in prosthodontics existed in the
majority of dental schools, and most schools offered incentives to
recruit faculty. The survey of deans found a very high level of exposure
of dental students to full-time prosthodontists and a very low exposure
level to students enrolled in advanced education in prosthodontics. The
establishment of mentoring programs in prosthodontics was reported by
most deans, and the predoctoral curriculum included treating complex
cases. Most deans stated that dual-specialty training in prosthodontics
and periodontics would be beneficial. The 2009 survey reported an
increase in the number of departments of prosthodontics in US schools.

such an empirical examination has not yet been conducted on a
quantitative level. Using a unique dataset of survey responses from a
maximum of 325 researchers based in Korean and Taiwanese universities,
industry, and GRIs, this article shows that there are some significant
differences between and within countries. Most importantly, policy
interventions to promote university-industry-GRI interactions impact the
degree to which specific information transfers are considered useful. In
Korea, formal transfers are emphasized, while both formal and, in
particular, informal transfers are emphasized in Taiwan.

N2  - When considering householder responses to flood risk, researchers and
policy makers have perhaps focused too much on the influence of risk
perceptions and concerns about material costs and benefits. Using
secondary analysis of survey data from UK households who had experienced
flooding or who were at risk of flooding, this paper presents evidence
to suggest that protective behaviour may be influenced less by material
and financial considerations than by concerns about feelings of anxiety
and insecurity. It also looks at the role of beliefs about protection
and flooding in mediating the impacts of flood experience and suggests
that experience reduces confidence in the ameliorative capacity of
insurance and promotes the belief that protective measures increase
anxiety about flooding. The paper concludes that more research should be
carried out on the role of anticipated emotions in risk response and
that policy makers and the designers of protection products should pay
more attention to the emotional barriers and incentives to adaptation.

N2  - Economic modelling generally assumes that businesses are profit
maximisers. However, behavioural economics holds that businesses pursue
multiple objectives and may even sacrifice some profit. This has
implications for the effectiveness of incentive-based environmental
policies. Using Danish farmers as a case, this paper examines whether
non-economic rationales may trump economic ones in farmer decisions,
and, unlike previous research, we quantify how widespread non-economic
values are compared to more economic values. Data derive from a survey
(1164 responses) of Danish conventional farmers' decision rationales
regarding their use of pesticides. Using cluster analysis, we show that
some farmers are more economically motivated while other farmers are
more focused on optimising yield and pay less attention to expenditures
and crop prices. Furthermore, we find that the two groups differ in
their response to policy instruments; farmers who focus on yield
indicate less responsiveness to economic policy instruments. The results
imply that it is important to implement a broad array of policy
instruments to match different farmer rationales.

N2  - Background: There are many reasons why an investigator may choose to
share results with survey respondents; however, the practice is not
universal. Moreover, while there is some evidence that the practice
increases response rates, it is of limited generalizability.
Objective: The aim of this study was to determine both the impact on
survey response rates of offering study results to participants, and the
extent to which surveyed individuals with diabetes mellitus want results
reported back from a postal questionnaire.
Methods: In November-December 2009, we surveyed 4796 randomly selected
individuals from a US Midwestern health system diabetes registry. Half
of the sample was randomized to receive an offer of survey results as an
incentive. Response rates were compared across the two groups. Within
the group offered results, we compared those that requested them with
those that declined with respect to demographic characteristics,
self-reported diabetes severity, and characterization of care received
for diabetes.
Results: The overall response rate was 42.8% (n = 2055). Offering
survey results did not impact response rates overall or within specific
subpopulations. Of those randomized to the offer of results, 62.1%
requested the results (n = 618). Requests for results differed by
educational attainment and the rating of diabetes care as poor, although
only education remained a significant predictor in multivariate
analysis. There were no differences in rates of requests by disease
severity or overall health status.
Conclusion: Offering survey results to potential respondents did not
increase the likelihood of response among a patient population with
diabetes. Of those that were offered results and returned the survey,
62.1% requested that they receive study results, indicating a
potentially important educational opportunity. However, as result
requests were driven more by educational attainment than by health
status, investigators may want to send results to everyone, not just
those that request them.

N2  - In this paper we use a best practice index constructed from the survey
responses of regulators in 40 countries to explore the determinants of
the methods used in electricity network regulation. Drawing from the
incentive regulation and institutional economics literature, we
construct an empirical model to investigate the impact of industry size,
political and economic institutions on the degree of best practice
regulation. Our results suggest that the existence and experience of an
independent regulator is the most important institutional determinant of
best practice regulation. In addition, small numbers of network
companies act as a constraint on the use of advanced benchmarking
methods. Finally, regional effects are also important. These findings
lead us to question whether one ``best practice{''} model is in fact
applicable to countries with very different political and economic
contexts. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Little is known about what strategies are cost-effective in increasing
participation among physicians in surveys that are conducted exclusively
via the web. To assess the effects of incentives and prenotification on
response rates and costs, general internists (N = 3,550) were randomly
selected from the American Medical Association (AMA) Masterfile and
assigned to experimental groups that varied in the amount of a promised
incentive (none, entry into a $200 lottery, $50, or $100) and
prenotification (none, prenotification letter only, or prenotification
letter containing a $2 preincentive). Results indicated that the
response rates were highest in the groups promised $100 and $50,
respectively. While the postal prenotification letter increased response
rates, the inclusion of a small token $2 preincentive had no effect on
participation. Further, unlike mail surveys of physicians, the $2
preincentive was not cost-effective. Among physicians, larger promised
incentives of $50 or $100 are more effective than a nominal
preincentive in increasing participation in a web-only survey.
Consistent with prior research, there was little evidence of nonresponse
bias among the experimental groups.

N2  - While surveys of nurses are an important tool in health services and
policy research, they are often characterized by low response rates. The
authors conducted a systematic review of 22 published reports of efforts
to improve response rates to nurse surveys. Two general strategies were
explored in this literature: incentive and design-based approaches. Even
small financial incentives were found to be effective in improving nurse
survey participation. Token nonmonetary incentives, in contrast, were
much less effective. In terms of design strategies, postal and telephone
strategies have generally been more successful than have fax or
web-based approaches, with evidence also supporting use of mixed-mode
surveys in this population. In addition, use of first-class stamps on
return envelopes as well as questionnaires personalized and endorsed by
legitimizing professional associations were also more likely to be
successful. Researchers should continue to implement evidence-based
strategies in order to improve the survey response of nurses.

N2  - This study investigates the effects of non-response bias in a 2010
postal survey assessing experiences with H1N1 influenza vaccine
administration among a diverse sample of providers (N = 765) in
Washington state. Though we garnered a high response rate (80.9%) by
using evidence-based survey design elements, including intensive
follow-up and a gift card incentive from Target, non-response bias could
exist if there were differences between respondents and non-respondents.
We investigated differences between the two groups for seven variables:
road distance to the nearest Target store, practice type, previous
administration of vaccines, region, urbanicity, size of practice, and
Vaccines for Children (VFC) program enrollment. We also examined the
effect of non-response bias on survey estimates. Statistically
significant differences between respondents and non-respondents were
found for four variables: miles to the nearest Target store, type of
medical practice, whether the practice routinely administered additional
vaccines besides H1N1, and urbanicity. Practices were more likely to
respond if they were from a small town or rural area (OR = 7.68, 95% CI
= 1.44-40.88), were a non-traditional vaccine provider type (OR = 2.08,
95% CI = 1.06-4.08) or a pediatric provider type (OR = 4.03, 95% CI =
1.36-11.96), or administered additional vaccines besides H1N1 (OR =
1.80, 95% CI = 1.03-3.15). Of particular interest, for each ten mile
increase in road distance from the nearest Target store, the likelihood
of provider response decreased (OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.60-0.89). Of
those variables associated with response, only small town or rural
practice location was associated with a survey estimate of interest,
suggesting that non-response bias had a minimal effect on survey
estimates. These findings show that gift card incentives alongside
survey design elements and follow-up can achieve high response rates.
However, there is evidence that practices farther from the nearest place
to redeem gift cards may be less likely to respond to the survey.

N2  - Background/context: The National Assessment of Educational Progress
(NAEP) is the only comparative assessment of academic competencies
regularly administered to nationally representative samples of students
enrolled in Grades 4, 8, and 12. Because NAEP is a low-stakes
assessment, there are long-standing questions about the level of
engagement and effort of the 12th graders who participate in the
assessment and, consequently, about the validity of the reported
results.
Purpose/Focus: This study investigated the effects of monetary
incentives on the performance of 12th graders on a reading assessment
closely modeled on the NAEP reading test in order to evaluate the
likelihood that scores obtained at regular administrations underestimate
student capabilities.
Population: The study assessed more than 2,600 students in a convenience
sample of 59 schools in seven states. The schools are heterogeneous with
respect to demographics and type of location.
Intervention: There were three conditions: a control and two incentive
interventions. For the fixed incentive, students were offered $20 at
the start of the session. For the contingent incentive, students were
offered $5 in advance and $15 for correct responses to each of two
randomly chosen questions, for a maximum payout of $35. All students
were administered one of eight booklets comprising two reading blocks (a
passage with associated questions) and a background questionnaire. All
reading blocks were operational blocks released by NAEP.
Research Design: This was a randomized controlled field trial. Students
agreed to participate without knowing that monetary incentives would be
offered. Random allocation to condition was conducted independently in
each school.
Data Collection/Analysis: Regular NAEP contractors administered the
assessments and carried out preliminary data processing. Scaling of
results and linking to the NAEP reporting scale were conducted using
standard NAEP procedures.
Findings: Monetary incentives have a statistically significant and
substantively important impact on both student engagement/effort and
performance overall, and for most subgroups defined by gender, race, and
background characteristics. For both males and females, the effect of
the contingent incentive was more than 5 NAEP score points,
corresponding to one quarter of the difference in the average scores
between Grades 8 and 12. In general, the effect of the contingent
incentive was larger than that of the fixed incentive, particularly for
lower scoring subgroups.
Conclusions/Recommendations: There is now credible evidence that NAEP
may both underestimate the reading abilities of students enrolled in
12th grade and yield biased estimates of certain achievement gaps.
Responsible officials should take this into account as they plan changes
to the NAEP reading framework and expand the scope of the 12th-grade
assessment survey.

N2  - Objective: To assess student pharmacists' interest and opinions in
providing reproductive health services, particularly hormonal
contraception (HC), in their future practices.
Methods: This descriptive, nonexperimental, cross-sectional study was
conducted in California between February and May 2007. Surveys were
distributed to 790 second-and third-year student pharmacists to measure
interest, opinions, and perceived barriers in providing HC services.
Results: 502 survey responses (63.5% response rate) were received.
Student pharmacists reported interest in providing HC services (96.2%)
to both minors and adults (53.3%), adults (40.6%), or minors (6.2%).
Students felt that patients would benefit from improved access and
advice (94.0%). Inadequate pharmacist time was deemed an extremely
important barrier in determining whether pharmacists could efficiently
and effectively provide HC services, followed by lack of private
counseling area in the pharmacy, inadequate patient health information,
and lack of appropriate incentive structure. Students were interested in
providing other reproductive health services, specifically preventive
measures against sexually transmitted infections (STIs; 89.2%) and STI
treatment for the partners of patients presenting with valid STI
prescriptions (88.4%).
Conclusion: Student pharmacists were very interested in providing
pharmacy access to HC and related reproductive health services as future
practitioners. The willingness of student pharmacists to provide this
support indicates that pharmacy access to HC could be a viable service.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Insight into motivating factors and barriers for blood
donation, especially for young people and underrepresented minorities,
is important to donor recruitment and retention. We surveyed donors at a
new blood collection facility based on a large, ethnically diverse
university campus.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Individuals who had donated or attempted to
donate at the facility during the first 17 months of its operation were
invited by e-mail to respond to an anonymous, Web-based questionnaire.
Respondents were asked to provide demographic characteristics, rate the
importance of various motivating and deterring factors for blood
donation, and indicate how they prefer to be contacted by the blood
center.
RESULTS: More than 30% of the 1619 invitees responded, 95.6% (n = 479)
of whom gave complete responses. The respondents were ethnically
diverse, and 79.1% were between 18 and 28 years of age. Altruism was by
far the most important motivating factor for donation. However,
incentives were also rated as important or very important by 72.2% of
the respondents. Inconvenience due to time or location constraints was
the most important deterrent. E-mailing was the most preferred contact
method and chosen by 80.3% of those surveyed. Some differences were
noted in the responses from members of different age, sex, and ethnic
groups.
CONCLUSION: Although overall altruism and inconvenience were the major
motivating factor and deterrent for blood, some demographic differences
existed in donor attitude toward incentive programs and preference for
the method of contact used by blood centers for recruitment purposes.

N2  - We estimate the landowner response to and fiscal effects of a temporary
reduction in capital gains taxes Unposed on land sales. The underlying
normative decision rules are first derived and solved numerically using
stochastic dynamic programming. The landowner preferences and
willingness to sell land are then estimated in the reduced form using
survey data from Finland. The results suggest that the timing of land
sales and land sales quantities respond significantly to tax incentives.
Certain temporary tax waiver programs could maintain the current tax
revenues with fewer trade distorting effects on the land market. (JEL

N2  - Background. Delivery in a healthcare facility is associated with better
outcomes for both mother and child. However, in India, a large
proportion of deliveries take place outside health facilities. We
studied the effect of maternal education on the choice of location for
delivery in the Indian population.
Methods. Data from the National Family Health Survey 3 (NFHS-3) were
used. The survey included women who were selected using a multi-stage
(2-stage for urban areas and 3-stage for rural areas), stratified (based
on demographic or social factors) sampling technique; the primary
sampling units selected were proportional to population size, and the
subsequent steps used simple random sampling. Effect of maternal
education on the choice of place for delivery (home, public or private
facility) was investigated through a multinomial logistic regression
model. The model adjusted for several factors at individual, household
and community level, the survey design effect and included sampling
weights.
Results. Of the 124 385 women aged 15-49 years included in the NFHS-3
dataset, 36 850 (29.6%) had had one or more childbirth during the past
5 years. A little more than half of all the deliveries were at home, and
approximately a quarter each of the remaining deliveries were at public
and private facilities, respectively. Maternal education was strongly
and independently associated with the choice of location of delivery.
For the choice sets of public facility versus home delivery and private
facility versus home delivery, a clear dose-response relationship was
apparent-higher maternal education was associated with a higher
probability of delivery at a public or private health facility compared
to home.
Conclusion. Level of maternal education was a significant independent
predictor of choice of location for childbirth among Indian women.
Compared to cash incentives to increase facility-based delivery,
improving maternal education may be a better way to achieve long term
and sustained increase in facility deliveries in India.

N2  - Introduction: There is growing international interest in the use of
financial incentives in smoking cessation, yet little research on public
opinion of the scheme. This paper reports on the acceptability of
incentives for reducing smoking in pregnant women and the perceived size
of incentive that would encourage smoking cessation during pregnancy.
Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted on a convenience sample
of 213 women attending the antenatal clinic of a large public hospital
in Australia. Participants completed a questionnaire on their views on
the use of incentives with responses measured on a 5-point Likert scale.
Results: The majority of participants (60%) did not agree that paying
pregnant smokers to quit is a good idea. Opinions regarding the likely
effectiveness were mixed with 30% of respondents in agreement and 22%
undecided. Most (62%) were not willing to pay smokers any amount to
quit. Smokers were more likely to have more favorable views about
incentives than nonsmokers (p < .0001) and considered payments of
between $100 and >$1,000 acceptable as reward for quitting smoking.
Conclusions: Acceptability for the use of financial incentives in
reducing antenatal smoking is low among pregnant women. Future research
should explore views of a wider audience and continue to gather stronger
evidence of the efficacy of rewards for reducing smoking in pregnancy.

N2  - Purpose: This study consisted of two parts. Part 1 was a survey of US
program directors, and Part 2 reports on the survey findings distributed
to the deans of US dental schools. Both surveys evaluated observations
of trends in prosthodontic education. The first survey (2005) of program
directors and deans was published in 2007. This second survey was
conducted in 2009. The 2009 survey provided 10-year data on trends in
prosthodontics as reported by program directors.
Materials and Methods: A national e-mail survey of 46 program directors
was used to collect enrollment data for years 1 to 3 of prosthodontics
training for US and international dental school graduates, the total
number of applicants and applications considered, and the trends over
time of applicants to prosthodontics for US dental school graduates and
for international graduates. In addition, the program directors were
asked to rank 13 key factors that may have contributed to any changes in
the prosthodontic applicant pool. Program directors were also asked for
information on student financial incentives and whether their programs
were state or federally funded, and whether their sponsoring institution
was a dental school.
Results: Of the 46 program directors, 40 responded, for an 87% response
rate. Respondents reported that 66% of their enrollees were graduates
of US dental schools. Between 2000 and 2009 the applicant pool in
prosthodontics nearly doubled, with 50% of the program directors
reporting an increase in US-trained applicants, 42.5% reporting no
change, and only 7.5% reporting a decrease. Using the Spearman
correlation for the 10-year survey, there was a positive, statistically
significant correlation that society's demand for a higher level of
training and credentialing and interest in prosthodontics among dental
students contributed to an increase in the number of US dental graduates
applying to prosthodontic programs. Only four programs offered no
financial packages to offset tuition. The remaining 36 respondents
reported some financial package. Among the respondents, there were 23
state-sponsored programs and 6 sponsored by private universities; the
remaining 9 were sponsored by hospitals or federal agencies.
Conclusions: A nearly doubled applicant pool and more US-trained
applicants to prosthodontics ensure a much more competitive applicant
pool for our specialty. In the 2009 survey, program directors reported
that factors such as society's demand for a higher level of training and
credentialing, interest in prosthodontics among US dental students,
advances in implant, esthetic, and reconstructive dentistry, literature
pertaining to the need of prosthodontists for the future, marketing of
prosthodontics as a career, and the dollar value of prosthodontic
training have all had some impact on increasing the mentored applicant
pool to prosthodontic training in the United States.

N2  - Objective. To compare the effects of lottery-based and fixed incentives
on clinicians' response to surveys.
Data Sources. Three randomized trials with fixed payments and
actuarially equivalent lotteries.
Study Design. Trial 1 compared a low-probability/high-payout lottery, a
high-probability/low-payout lottery, and no incentive. Trial 2 compared
a moderate-probability/moderate-payout lottery with an unconditional
fixed payment (payment sent with questionnaire). Trial 3 compared a
moderate-probability/moderate-payout lottery with a conditional fixed
payment (payment promised following response).
Principal Findings. Neither the low-probability nor high-probability
lotteries improved response compared with no incentive. Unconditional
fixed payments produced significantly greater response than actuarially
equivalent lotteries, but conditional fixed payments did not.
Conclusions. Lottery-based incentives do not improve clinicians'
response rates compared with no incentives, and they are inferior to
unconditional fixed payments.

N2  - This study presents a method for assessing conservation opportunity on
private land based on landholders' socio-economic, behavioral, and farm
characteristics. These characteristics include age, gender, education,
level of off-farm income, farm size, proportion of remnant native
vegetation on-farm, and ecological value of native vegetation on-farm. A
sample of landholders who own greater than 2 ha of land in the South
Australian Murray-Darling Basin region were sent a mail-based survey
about their values and preferences for environmental management (N =
659, 52% response). Cross-tabulations and ANOVA statistical analysis
techniques were used to compare the socio-economic attributes across
three landholder classes: disengaged, moderately engaged, and highly
engaged in native vegetation planting. Results indicate that highly
engaged landholders were more likely to be female, formally educated,
hobby farmers who managed small parcels of land and have high off-farm
incomes, whereas disengaged landholders held significantly stronger
farming connections (more farming experience, family have lived on the
farm for more generations). Spatial analysis revealed area-specific
differences in conservation opportunity and conservation priority. In
some areas, properties of high ecological value were managed by highly
engaged landholders, but nearby properties of high value were managed by
moderately engaged or disengaged landholders. Environmental managers
therefore cannot assume areas of high conservation priority will be
areas of high conservation opportunity. At the regional scale, the
potential for revegetation seems most promising within the moderately
engaged landholder group considering the vast amount of land managed by
this group in areas of high ecological value, particularly within the
less represented Mallee and Coorong and Rangelands sub-regions. We
suggest that incentive schemes which purchase conservation need to be
targeted at disengaged landholders: mentoring schemes led by commercial
farmers highly engaged in native vegetation planting should be directed
at moderately engaged landholders, and; awards programs which
acknowledge conservation successes should be targeted at highly engaged
landholders. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objective: The primary objective of this study was to investigate
whether nonresponders to a medication-beliefs survey exhibited different
adherence and persistence patterns than survey responders.
Methods: A medication-beliefs survey was mailed to 7795 adults aged from
40 to 88 years, who filled a qualifying index prescription
(cardiovascular, dyslipidemia, oral-antihyperglycemic,
oral-bisphosphonate, and asthma-controller medications) in June 2008 at
1 national and 2 regional retail pharmacies. Adherence and persistence
to the index drug class was measured using pharmacy-claims data over 12
months. A multivariate generalized linear model with a negative binomial
distribution and log-link function was used to determine whether
response status was a significant predictor of adherence. Kaplan-Meier
estimates of survival curves were used to assess the time to
discontinuation (persistence). Differences between nonresponders and
responders were assessed using the log-rank test.
Results: The survey response rate was 24.25%. The final analytic sample
size after exclusions was 6740 patients (5044 nonresponders and 1696
responders). On the basis of multivariate generalized linear model
analysis, survey nonresponders had 11% lower medication adherence
compared with responders (P < 0.01; goodness-of-fit = 1.09 as defined by
deviance/df statistics). The proportion of nonresponders deemed
nonpersistent at day 305 was 66.3% compared with 58.1% of responders
(P < 0.001). The Kaplan-Meier persistence curves were significantly
different for nonresponders and responders as assessed by the log-rank
test (chi(2) statistic - 49.38; P < 0.001).
Conclusions: Our study found that the responders and nonresponders to a
medication-beliefs survey differed significantly in their subsequent
adherence and persistence, suggesting that biased survey results are
likely to accompany low response rates in surveys of medication use. The
use of modest monetary incentives had a small effect on survey response;
multiple survey levers are recommended to reduce nonresponse and the
potential for biased results.

N2  - Background: Some believe that a substantial amount of US health care is
unnecessary, suggesting that it would be possible to control costs
without rationing effective services. The views of primary care
physicians-the frontline of health care delivery-are not known.
Methods: Between June and December 2009, we conducted a nationally
representative mail survey of US primary care physicians (general
internal medicine and family practice) randomly selected from the
American Medical Association Physician Masterfile (response rate, 70%;
n=627).
Results: Forty-two percent of US primary care physicians believe that
patients in their own practice are receiving too much care; only 6%
said they were receiving too little. The most important factors
physicians identified as leading them to practice more aggressively were
malpractice concerns (76%), clinical performance measures (52%), and
inadequate time to spend with patients (40%). Physicians also believe
that financial incentives encourage aggressive practice: 62% said
diagnostic testing would be reduced if it did not generate revenue for
medical subspecialists (39% for primary care physicians). Almost all
physicians (95%) believe that physicians vary in what they would do for
identical patients; 76% are interested in learning how aggressive or
conservative their own practice style is compared with that of other
physicians in their community.
Conclusions: Many US primary care physicians believe that their own
patients are receiving too much medical care. Malpractice reform,
realignment of financial incentives, and more time with patients could
remove pressure on physicians to do more than they feel is needed.
Physicians are interested in feedback on their practice style,
suggesting they may be receptive to change.

N2  - Background: Despite increasing recognition that mentoring is essential
early in medical careers, little is known about the prevalence of
mentoring programs for medical students. We conducted this study to
survey all medical schools in Germany regarding the prevalence of
mentoring programs for medical students as well as the characteristics,
goals and effectiveness of these programs.
Methods: A definition of mentoring was established and program inclusion
criteria were determined based on a review of the literature. The
literature defined mentoring as a steady, long-lasting relationship
designed to promote the mentee's overall development. We developed a
questionnaire to assess key characteristics of mentoring programs: the
advocated mentoring model, the number of participating mentees and
mentors, funding and staff, and characteristics of mentees and mentors
(e. g., level of training). In addition, the survey characterized the
mentee-mentor relationship regarding the frequency of meetings, forms of
communication, incentives for mentors, the mode of matching mentors and
mentees, and results of program evaluations. Furthermore, participants
were asked to characterize the aims of their programs. The questionnaire
consisted of 34 questions total, in multiplechoice (17), numeric (7) and
free-text (10) format. This questionnaire was sent to deans and medical
education faculty in Germany between June and September 2009. For
numeric answers, mean, median, and standard deviation were determined.
For free-text items, responses were coded into categories using
qualitative free text analysis.
Results: We received responses from all 36 medical schools in Germany.
We found that 20 out of 36 medical schools in Germany offer 22 active
mentoring programs with a median of 125 and a total of 5,843 medical
students (6.9-7.4% of all German medical students) enrolled as mentees
at the time of the survey. 14 out of 22 programs (63%) have been
established within the last 2 years. Six programs (27%) offer mentoring
in a one-on-one setting. 18 programs (82%) feature faculty physicians
as mentors. Nine programs (41%) involve students as mentors in a
peer-mentoring setting. The most commonly reported goals of the
mentoring programs include: establishing the mentee's professional
network (13 programs, 59%), enhancement of academic performance (11
programs, 50%) and counseling students in difficulties (10 programs,
45%).
Conclusions: Despite a clear upsurge of mentoring programs for German
medical students over recent years, the overall availability of
mentoring is still limited. The mentoring models and goals of the
existing programs vary considerably. Outcome data from controlled
studies are needed to compare the efficiency and effectiveness of
different forms of mentoring for medical students.

N2  - According to neoclassical economic theory, a stated preference
elicitation format comprising a single binary choice between the status
quo and one alternative is incentive compatible under certain
conditions. Formats typically used in choice experiments comprising a
sequence of discrete choice questions do not hold this property. In this
paper, the effect on stated preferences of expanding the number of
binary choice tasks per respondent from one to four is tested using a
split sample treatment in an attribute-based survey relating to the
undergrounding of overhead low-voltage electricity and
telecommunications wires. We find evidence to suggest that presenting
multiple choice tasks per respondent decreases estimates of expected
willingness to pay. Preferences stated in the first of a sequence of
choice tasks are not significantly different from those stated in the
incentive compatible single binary choice task, but, in subsequent
choice tasks, responses are influenced by cost levels observed in past
questions. Three behavioural explanations can be advanced - weak
strategic misrepresentation, reference point revision, and asymmetric
value learning. The evidence is contrary to the standard assumption of
truthful response with stable preferences. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

N2  - The sluggish supply response in most developing countries to the
apparently favourable agricultural market situation of the past few
years can be explained by the limited ability of price incentives to
bring about an increase in production and marketed surplus in the
presence of binding non-price constraints. This article characterises
farm household heterogeneity in access to assets, markets and
infrastructure drawing on household survey data from 15 developing
countries. We relate this heterogeneity in access to household ability
to engage successfully in agricultural output markets and find
consistent supporting evidence for the hypothesis that this lack of
access is significantly constraining their potential to engage
successfully in agriculture.

N2  - We report results from two statewide experiments in Washington designed
to test potential methods for using postal mail to obtain survey
responses over the Internet from address-based samples of general public
households. The five methods we test are: 1) sending Web and mail modes
of response sequentially; 2) providing a prepaid $5 incentive; 3)
offering an instruction card for responding over the Web; 4) sending the
follow-up request by Priority Mail; and 5) providing an additional $5
incentive with this follow-up request. Results are evaluated from the
standpoint of response rates, demographic representativeness of
respondents, and survey costs and data collection times for Web and mail
modes. We find that a ``Web-plus-mail{''} design-mailing an initial Web
request followed by a mail request-with the prepaid incentive offers
much potential for obtaining Internet responses. In addition, the mail
follow-up to the initial Web request significantly increases overall
response rates and improves respondent representativeness. However, the
results also show that a mail-only design consistently obtains higher
response rates and a demographically similar sample compared to
Web-plus-mail. We also find significant challenges in obtaining a
representative sample of respondents with either Web or mail modes and
in realizing the potential cost and speed benefits of the Internet in
using postal mail contacts.

N2  - Objective: Accurate medical error reporting is crucial for reducing the
occurrence of such errors and their adverse consequences. This study
aims to investigate the views of physicians about medical error
reporting in a tertiary care hospital in Saudi Arabia.
Methods: This is a cross-sectional self-administrated survey study. All
physicians in the hospital were invited to complete an anonymous survey
questionnaire addressing demographic details, as well as attitudes,
practice, and views on medical error reporting.
Results: One hundred seven physicians completed the questionnaires
(66.5% response rate). Mean (SD) age was 39.8 (9.0) years. One-fifth of
the respondents worked in the emergency department, and half had a
workload of 40 to 59 h/wk. The reason given by 41.1% for not reporting
a medical error by a colleague was that ``it is not their
responsibility.{''} However, the gravity of the outcome of a medical
error by a colleague to the patient was thought to be an important
incentive for reporting. Of the physicians, 43% agreed that they would
conceal the occurrence of a medical error they incurred to ``avoid
punishment.{''} Nevertheless, most of the respondents held the view that
there exists an ethical underpinning for reporting medical errors and
that reporting of medical errors serve a valuable purpose.
Conclusions: The physicians in our study are likely to disclose errors
made by a colleague only if the error resulted in a severe damage to the
patient, and as such, medical errors go underreported for a variety of
reasons. It was felt that assurance of confidentiality and protection
from backlash would promote medical error disclosure.

N2  - Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are rapidly becoming the
foundations to the decision support systems of many organizations, but
have all too often failed to deliver their expected benefits. Most ERP
implementation projects are carried out using implementation consultants
hired from outside the client firm. The current study treated the
consultants as agents and the clients as principals, and applied agency
theory to test the consultant-client relationship as a predictor of ERP
implementation project success.
A survey collected responses from 192 client project managers who worked
on the ERP implementation process in their organizations. Data analysis
via structural equation modeling showed that more consultant monitoring
predicts less moral hazard (i.e., consultant shirking), that less moral
hazard predicts greater ERP project success, and that more monitoring
directly predicts such success. However, the analysis failed to support
expectations that more pre-qualification efforts (i.e., screening of the
consultant) would lead to less adverse selection (i.e., the consultant's
misrepresentation of skills) or that less adverse selection would lead
to greater ERP success. Surprisingly greater incentive alignment
predicted greater moral hazard, thus suggesting the potential of
incentives to de-motivate rather than motivate.
This study contributed by extending agency theory to outsourced
information systems project implementation. It provided new, validated
measures of prequalification efforts, monitoring, incentive alignment,
moral hazard, and adverse selection constructs. The findings suggest
that future researchers may want to learn more about incentive alignment
and its impact, and that information systems project managers may want
to monitor more to improve ERP and other large-scale system
implementation success.

N2  - In this paper we use data from a unique survey conducted in the
aftermath of the 1998 floods in Bangladesh to examine how the household
shock child labor relationship is affected by credit receipts of
households. Adopting the ratio of assets lost due to the floods as a
likely exogenous shock proxy, we find that child labor increases with
the magnitude of the shock but only if households do not receive credit.
This suggests that following shocks child labor may be a response to
non-availability of credit. The policy implication suggests a distinct
and alternative channel in combating the economic incentives behind
child labor access to credit diminishes the immediate financial burden
on constrained households, reducing their need for child labor. (C) 2011

N2  - Institutions of higher education rely on student surveys for a number of
purposes, including planning, assessment, and research. Web surveys are
especially prevalent given their ease of use and low-cost; yet,
obtaining a high response rate is a challenge. Although researchers have
investigated the use of incentives in traditional mail surveys, studies
investigating the impact of lottery incentives on web survey response
rates are limited. In this study, four separate web survey experiments
were conducted to measure the effectiveness of lottery-based incentives
in a college student population in the United States. Findings reveal
that the lottery incentives not only positively impacted response rates
but also exerted differential effects by gender. The results have
practical implications for higher education researchers who conduct web
surveys of college students.

N2  - Background: Early detection of symptoms arising from exposure to
pathogens, harmful substances, or environmental changes is required for
timely intervention. The administration of Web-based questionnaires is a
potential method for collecting information from a sample population.
Objective: The objective of our study was to develop a Web-based daily
questionnaire for health (WDQH) for symptomatic surveillance.
Methods: We adopted two different survey methods to develop the WDQH: an
Internet panel survey, which included participants already registered
with an Internet survey company, and the Tokyo Consumers' Co-operative
Union (TCCU) Internet survey, in cooperation with the Japanese
Consumers' Co-operative Union, which recruited participants by website
advertising. The Internet panel survey participants were given a fee
every day for providing answers, and the survey was repeated twice with
modified surveys and collection methods: Internet Panel Survey I was
conducted every day, and Internet Panel Survey II was conducted every 3
days to reduce costs. We examined whether the survey remained valid by
reporting health conditions on day 1 over a 3-day period, and whether
the response rate would vary among groups with different incentives. In
the TCCU survey, participants were given a fee only for initially
registering, and health information was provided in return for survey
completion. The WDQH included the demographic details of participants
and prompted them to answer questions about the presence of various
symptoms by email. Health information collected by the WDQH was then
used for the syndromic surveillance of infection.
Results: Response rates averaged 47.3% for Internet Panel Survey I,
42.7% for Internet Panel Survey II, and 40.1% for the TCCU survey.
During a seasonal influenza epidemic, the WDQH detected a rapid increase
in the number of participants with fever through the early aberration
reporting system.
Conclusions: We developed a health observation method based on
self-reporting by participants via the Internet. We validated the
usefulness of the WDQH by its practical use in syndromic surveillance.

N2  - Brazil's primary energy matrix is based on more than 47% of renewables,
and more than 85% of its electricity is generated by hydro power
sources. Despite this large fraction of renewable energy resources, less
than 0.3% of the national energy supply comes from solar or wind
sources. This paper presents a diagnostic review on the penetration of
the solar and wind energy technologies in Brazil. It also includes a
survey of the latest government policies and incentives for renewable
energies deployment by entrepreneurs, industry and commercial and
residential consumers. In addition, the paper analyses how to best meet
the requirements for policy support and information technology to boost
the deployment of solar technology and wind energy in Brazil. This study
was mostly based on results of a widely distributed survey covering key
issues, and also by personal interviews carried out with key
stakeholders in order to better understand the issues highlighted in the
survey responses. The study pointed out some of the main obstacles to
effectively promote and improve government policies and actions for
investment in solar and wind energy market in Brazil. (C) 2011 Elsevier

N2  - Background: Improvement of access to general practice is a priority in
England. In 2006/07 an annual national survey of patient experience of
access was introduced, with financial incentives to practices based on
the findings of the survey among their own patients. Objectives: To
describe changes in patient experience of access over the first two
years of the survey and incentive scheme, and identify respondent and
practice characteristics associated with patient experience of access.
Design and methods: The study included 222 general practices in the east
of England, which had completed the access survey in 2006/07 and
2007/08. We compared proportions of patients reporting satisfaction with
different aspects of access in each year. In explanatory regression
models, we investigated the associations between improvement of reported
access and respondent and practice characteristics. Results: There were
some small improvements in reported access between the two surveys,
although satisfaction with opening hours declined marginally. The
explanatory analysis showed that larger practices, a higher proportion
of respondents from ethnic minority groups, and higher deprivation were
associated with patient reports of worse access. These variables and
practice response rates did not explain the amount of change between the
two years.
Conclusions : The launch of the incentive scheme was not followed by
convincing improvements in patient experience of access. Practices with
deprived populations or with a high proportion of ethnic minority survey
respondents are perceived as offering worse access, were not more likely
to achieve improvements, and additional support should be considered to
help these practices.

N2  - The Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) is a nationally representative
longitudinal survey of approximately 9,000 families and their
descendants that has been ongoing since 1968. Since 1969, families have
been sent a mailing asking them to update or verify their contact
information to keep track of their whereabouts between waves. Having
updated contact information prior to data collection is associated with
fewer call attempts and refusal conversion efforts, less tracking, and
lower attrition. Given these apparent advantages, a study was designed
in advance of the 2009 PSID field effort to improve the response rate of
the contact update mailing. Families were randomly assigned to the
following conditions: mailing design (traditional versus new), $10 as a
prepaid versus postpaid incentive, timing and frequency of the mailing
(July 2008 versus October 2008 versus both times) and whether or not
they were sent a study newsletter. This article reports on findings with
regard to response rates to the mailing and the effect on production
outcomes including tracking rates and number of calls during 2009 under
these different conditions, examines whether the treatment effects
differ by key characteristics of panel members including likelihood of
moving and anticipated difficulty in completing an interview, and
provides some recommendations for the use of contact update strategies
in panel studies.

N2  - Objectives: Increased recognition that addictive behaviors tend to be
chronic and relapsing has led to a growing emphasis on longitudinal
substance abuse research. The purpose of this study was to identify
effective follow-up strategies used by National Institute on Drug
Abuse-funded investigators who have conducted at least 1 study involving
follow-up data collection from human subjects.
Methods: A web-based survey was administered to a representative sample
of National Institute on Drug Abuse-funded researchers (N = 153) with a
history of conducting longitudinal research.
Results: Reported study response rates were generally high, although
27% of the studies fell below the 80% benchmark. Face-to-face and
telephone-based interviews commanded the largest subject payments-2 to 3
times higher than compensation rates for collection of biologic samples.
With regard to the presumed impact of low follow-up rates on the
generalizability of study findings, one-third of investigators who
compared baseline characteristics of those who did and did not
participate in the follow-up found meaningful differences. Support was
found for the hypothesis that follow-up rates and total compensation
would be positively related, with the mean compensation amounts between
studies achieving <80% follow-up rate versus those achieving rates >=
80%, revealing a statistically significant effect in the predicted
direction.
Conclusions: The majority of respondents reported difficulty in tracking
and locating subjects, and study respondents often proved to be quite
different from nonrespondents. Incentives improved follow-up rates to a
point, although the relationship was not linear. Efforts to improve
follow-up rates may be better spent on addressing tracking and locating
logistics rather than on strategies to compel participation once the
subject has been located.

N2  - We conducted two experiments designed to evaluate several strategies for
improving response to Web and Web/mail mixed-mode surveys. Our goal was
to determine the best ways to maximize Web response rates in a highly
Internet-literate population with full Internet access. We find that
providing a simultaneous choice of response modes does not improve
response rates (compared to only providing a mail response option).
However, offering the different response modes sequentially, in which
Web is offered first and a mail follow-up option is used in the final
contact, improves Web response rates and is overall equivalent to using
only mail. We also show that utilizing a combination of both postal and
email contacts and delivering a token cash incentive in advance are both
useful methods for improving Web response rates. These experiments
illustrate that although different implementation strategies are viable,
the most effective strategy is the combined use of multiple
response-inducing techniques.

N2  - Recruitment of a large and reliable control group is a challenge in
psychological survey based research. The effect of recruitment styles
and age on response-rate, data quality, and individual differences were
investigated in a control group for a postal survey of elderly bereaved
people. This study was a direct reaction to the first recruitment
attempt that had a 10% response rate. This study consisted of four
groups of randomly selected elderly married people (65-81 years)
receiving a postal questionnaire measuring depression, social support,
coping style, adult attachment, life satisfaction, and personality
factors. All groups were exposed to a set of general initiatives
(customized introduction letter with university letterhead;
self-addressed, prepaid envelope included; personally directed letter
signed by the researcher; an assurance of confidentiality). Three groups
were exposed to different specific initiatives (short non-sensitive
questionnaire, recorded response, and monetary incentive independent of
response) to increase the response-rate. The results indicated that
general initiatives and information letters apparently increased the
response-rate from 10 to 31%. Monetary incentive had the highest
response-rate (51%), good data quality, and no sampling bias in
individual differences. This method can be highly recommended in future
control group recruitment.

N2  - Background: Community-based organizations (CBOs) are important
stakeholders in health systems and are increasingly called upon to use
research evidence to inform their advocacy, program planning, and
service delivery. To better support CBOs to find and use research
evidence, we sought to assess the capacity of CBOs in the HIV/AIDS
sector to acquire, assess, adapt, and apply research evidence in their
work.
Methods: We invited executive directors of HIV/AIDS CBOs in Ontario,
Canada (n = 51) to complete the Canadian Health Services Research
Foundation's ``Is Research Working for You?{''} survey.
Findings: Based on responses from 25 organizations that collectively
provide services to approximately 32,000 clients per year with 290
full-time equivalent staff, we found organizational capacity to acquire,
assess, adapt, and apply research evidence to be low. CBO strengths
include supporting a culture that rewards flexibility and quality
improvement, exchanging information within their organization, and
ensuring that their decision-making processes have a place for research.
However, CBO Executive Directors indicated that they lacked the skills,
time, resources, incentives, and links with experts to acquire research,
assess its quality and reliability, and summarize it in a user-friendly
way.
Conclusion: Given the limited capacity to find and use research
evidence, we recommend a capacity-building strategy for HIV/AIDS CBOs
that focuses on providing the tools, resources, and skills needed to
more consistently acquire, assess, adapt, and apply research evidence.
Such a strategy may be appropriate in other sectors and jurisdictions as
well given that CBO Executive Directors in the HIV/AIDS sector in
Ontario report low capacity despite being in the enviable position of
having stable government infrastructure in place to support them,
benefiting from long-standing investment in capacity building, and being
part of an active provincial network. CBOs in other sectors and
jurisdictions that have fewer supports may have comparable or lower
capacity. Future research should examine a larger sample of CBO
Executive Directors from a range of sectors and jurisdictions.

N2  - Background: Maximizing response rates is critically important in order
to provide the most generalizable and unbiased research results. High
response rates reduce the chance of respondents being systematically
different from non-respondents, and thus, reduce the risk of results not
truly reflecting the study population. Monetary incentives are often
used to improve response rates, but little is known about whether larger
incentives improve response rates in those who previously have been
unenthusiastic about participating in research. In this study we
compared the response rates and cost-effectiveness of a $ 5 versus $ 2
monetary incentive accompanying a short survey mailed to patients who
did not respond or refused to participate in research study with a
face-to-face survey.
Methods: 1,328 non-responders were randomly assigned to receive $ 5 or
$ 2 and a short, 10-question survey by mail. Reminder postcards were
sent to everyone; those not returning the survey were sent a second
survey without incentive. Overall response rates, response rates by
incentive condition, and odds of responding to the larger incentive were
calculated. Total costs (materials, postage, and labor) and incremental
cost-effectiveness ratios were also calculated and compared by incentive
condition.
Results: After the first mailing, the response rate within the $ 5
group was significantly higher (57.8% vs. 47.7%, p < .001); after the
second mailing, the difference narrowed by 80%, resulting in a
non-significant difference in cumulative rates between the $ 5 and $ 2
groups (67.3% vs. 65.4%, respectively, p = .47). Regardless of
incentive or number of contacts, respondents were significantly more
likely to be male, white, married, and 50-75 years old. Total costs were
higher with the larger versus smaller incentive ($ 13.77 versus $ 9.95
per completed survey).
Conclusions: A $ 5 incentive provides a significantly higher response
rate than a $ 2 incentive if only one survey mailing is used but not if
two survey mailings are used.

N2  - Since 2005, the Ohio Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS)
has used a prepaid phone card incentive in an effort to increase survey
response. Although Ohio PRAMS has generally achieved an overall response
rate of 70%, African American participation has been significantly
lower, a persistent problem documented by other PRAMS states. We
examined the effect of a gift card incentive compared to the standard
phone card on African American response. Sampled women in the African
American stratum of Ohio PRAMS were randomly assigned to either the
experimental (n = 276) or control (n = 274) incentive ($10 CVS gift
card or 30-min prepaid phone card, respectively). Response rates were
calculated for the total number of sampled African American women during
the study period. Partial or full completion of the survey instrument by
mail or phone was considered a response. Logistic regression was used to
identify independent predictors of response. Variables examined included
age, education, ethnicity, marital status, smoking status, birth weight,
Women Infants and Children (WIC) enrollment, prenatal care, parity, and
incentive assignment. The overall unweighted response rate was
significantly higher in the experimental group (60.5 vs. 48.5%, P =
.002). Maternal and infant characteristics were similar between groups.
Logistic regression modeling revealed that having more than 12 years of
education (OR = 2.46, 1.56-3.89), gift card incentive (OR = 1.46,
1.02-2.10), and enrollment in WIC (OR = 1.57, 1.05-2.35) were
independent predictors of increased survey response. Use of a $10 CVS
gift card incentive in place of a prepaid phone card can positively
impact African American response in PRAMS.

N2  - This paper discusses the key findings from a research project that
assessed the impacts of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's
Time of Day Pricing Initiative on the behavior of passenger car users.
The survey data, comprised of 505 observations, show that 7.4% of
passenger trips changed behavior because of the time of day pricing
initiative, and that demand is inelastic to tolls with elasticities in
the range of -0.11 to -0.24. Passenger car users who changed behavior
responded to time of day pricing by implementing multidimensional
strategies (3.23 different behavioral changes per user on average),
involving behavioral responses such as changes in facility usage,
changes in time of travel, changes in the payment type, and changes in
mode/occupancy. The most frequently cited behavioral response was to
shift mode, either to transit or carpool, and maintain the original time
of travel (done in 2.55% of trips), instead of changing time of travel
and maintaining the use of the passenger car (0.69% of trips). This
reluctance to change travel schedules is undoubtedly a reflection of the
limited time of travel flexibility that, on average, was estimated to be
20.4 and 12.3 min for early and late arrival for work-related trips.
This, in turn, suggests the need for comprehensive policies, possibly
involving incentives or regulations to foster employers' participation
in staggered/flexible work hour programs. Such approaches, combined with
time of day pricing, are likely to be more effective in balancing car
traffic during the day. Other behavioral responses of significance were
reduce the number of trips made during the weekday peak-hours (1.65%),
and switching to EZ-Pass to take advantage of the toll discounts
(0.81%).

smoking status in family, number of cigarettes smoked/day, influence for
starting it and use of nicotine replacement therapy was obtained.
Duration of study was from April 1 to May 30, 2009. Smoker was defined
as a person who, at the time of survey smoked cigarettes either daily or
occasionally.
Results: Response rate was 65.4%, of these 396 (60.55%) were male and
88(13.45%) were smokers. Smoking was more among the male students than
females (p-value < 0.001). The greatest percentage of smokers was in 3rd

N2  - Introduction: Rural health workforce issues are a priority area for the
Australian Government and substantial funding has been provided for
rural education programs to address health workforce disparities across
Australia's rural and remote communities. The Australian Government
established a Rural Health Strategy in 2001 and as a result there are
now 14 rural clinical schools in Australia. The 2008 Urbis Report
highlighted the lack of research on rural programs and workforce
outcomes, essential to ensuring that educational efforts, resources and
funding are being concentrated appropriately. This study examined the
Australian National University (ANU) Medical School's 4 year rural
program to identify the impact of elective and compulsory program
components on student intentions to practice in a rural and remote
location post-graduation. The study also explores factors that affect
student decisions to apply for year-long rural placements.
Methods: ANU Medical School's graduating cohort of 2008 fourth year
medical students completed an anonymous and voluntary online survey
questionnaire. Survey sections included student demographics, compulsory
and elective components of the ANU rural program, and an overall
evaluation of the ANU rural curriculum. The survey contained a mixture
of forced-answer questions and open-ended commentary. Quantitative data
were analyzed for descriptive and frequency statistics using EpiInfo
V3.5.1 (http://wwwn.cdc.gov/epiinfo/). Qualitative data were reviewed
and consistent themes among responses extracted.
Results: In total, 40 students from a cohort of 88 (45%) responded,
with 26 respondents (65%) indicating that at medical school
commencement they considered working in a rural or remote area. At the
end of their medical education, 33 respondents (82%) indicated their
intention to spend some time in their careers working in a rural or
remote area. Students from non-rural backgrounds had greater positive
change in their intentions to practice rurally as a direct effect of ANU
rural programs when compared with students from rural backgrounds. More
than 70% of students believed the amount of rural focus in the
curriculum was correct, 75% believed that they will be better medical
practitioners because of the program, and 85% found the curriculum was
delivered effectively. Students who undertook elective rural programs
such as a year-long rural placement were more likely to have future
rural career intentions when compared with students undertaking
compulsory rural components. Compulsory components, however, had a
strong influence on students applying for elective programs. Regarding
application for the year-long rural placement, students reported
clinical exposure was the most encouraging factor, and time away from
family and friends, and lack of spousal and family support were the most
discouraging factors.
Conclusions: Rural programs at the ANU, and medical school exposure to
rural health experiences is important in influencing students'
perceptions of a career in rural and remote health. This study provides
evidence that both compulsory and elective components contribute to a
successful holistic rural program which nurtures the rural interest of
all students. Overall, students at the ANU medical school were satisfied
with the rural curriculum. The results confirm that there is difficulty
in recruiting students with family commitments into year-long rural
placement programs, despite incentives. Those students who select
long-term rural study for reasons other than an interest in a career in
rural health end the program with positive rural intentions.

Conclusion: Our postal survey had a higher response rate than the online
survey. Our response to the postal survey was lower than other similar
studies and is likely to be due to a lack of incentives and follow-up.
Even with the low response rate it appears that postal surveys can
provide a good representation of the overall population.
Implications: Despite growing use of online surveys, postal surveys
should still be the method of choice whenever possible. Postal surveys
should include incentives and further follow-up of the initial
recruitment should be conducted.

N2  - Objective
To assess how quality information from multiple sources and financial
incentives affect consumer choice of physicians in tiered physician
networks.
Data Source
Survey of a stratified random sample of Massachusetts state employees.
Study Design
Respondents were assigned a hypothetical structure with differential
copayments for ``Tier 1{''} (preferred) and ``Tier 2{''} (nonpreferred)
physicians. Half of respondents were told they needed to select a
cardiologist, and half were told they needed to select a dermatologist.
Patients were asked whether they would choose a Tier 1 doctor, a Tier 2
doctor, or had no preference in a case where they had no further quality
information, a case where a family member or friend recommended a Tier 2
doctor, and a case where their personal physician recommended a Tier 2
doctor. The effects of copayments, recommendations, physician specialty,
and patient characteristics on the reported probability of selecting a
Tier 1 doctor are analyzed using multinomial logit and logistic
regression.
Principal Findings
Relative to a case where there is no copayment differential between
tiers, copayment differences of U.S.$10-U.S.$35 increase the number of
respondents indicating they would select a Tier 1 physician by 3.5-11.7
percent. Simulations suggest copayments must exceed U.S.$300 to
counteract the recommendation for a lower tiered physician from friends,
family, or a referring physician. Sensitivity to the copayments varied
with physician specialty.
Conclusions
Tiered provider networks with these copayment levels appear to have
limited influence on physician choice when contradicted by other trusted
sources. Consumers' response likely varies with physician specialty.

N2  - The positive association between social capital and general health
outcomes has been extensively researched over the past decade; however,
studies investigating social capital and psychological health show less
consistent results. Despite this, policy-makers worldwide still employ
elements of social capital to promote and improve psychological health.
This United Kingdom study investigates the association between changes
in psychological health over time and three different individual-level
proxies of social capital, measures of socio-economic status, social
support and the confounders age and gender. All data are derived from
the British Household Panel Survey data, with the same individuals (N =
7994) providing responses from 2000-2007.
The data were split according to baseline psychological health status
('Good' or `Poor' psychological health the dependent variable). Using
Generalised Estimating Equations, two separate models were built to
investigate the association between changes from baseline psychological
health over time and considered variables. An autoregressive working
correlation structure was employed to derive the true influence of
explanatory variables on psychological health outcomes over time.
We found that generalised trust was the only social capital variable to
maintain a positive and highly significant association with
psychological health in multivariable models. All measures of
socioeconomic status and social support were rendered insignificant, bar
one. We therefore argue that the breakdown of the traditional family
unit (and subsequent reduction in family capital investment), along with
psychosocial pathways, demonstrate plausible mechanisms by which a
decrease in generalised trust could lead to an increasing trend of worse
psychological health in youth over successive birth cohorts. Policy
makers, while providing welfare solutions in response to breakdown in
traditional family structure, must also consider perverse incentives
they provide. If perceived as a viable lifestyle choice, welfare
provision could inadvertently promote further decline of trust, at even
greater cost to society. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - The estimation of non-market environmental values remains a challenge to
economists seeking to provide relevant information to policy-makers. The
demand for such information is increasing, especially in response to
statutory requirements for economic analyses of policy initiatives.
Studies undertaken in response to this demand continue to be criticised
for producing biased results. Research into the use of Choice Modelling
to estimate environmental values has sought to meet that challenge.
Choice Modelling involves survey respondents revealing their values for
environmental changes by making choices between numerous alternative
future management scenarios. Through the choices made, inferences can be
drawn about the trade-offs people are willing to make across
environmental outcomes. By specifying one of those outcomes as a
monetary cost, respondents' willingness to pay for different policies
can be estimated. Recent research projects outlined here have estimated
the value of catchment protection investments in New South Wales and
Tasmania, alternative management of nature reserves, and climate change
impacts. Key methodology issues confronted in these applications have
been the design of choice experiment surveys to ensure that respondents
have an incentive to answer without bias, the incorporation of
uncertainty in the future management scenarios, the selection of
appropriate attributes of environmental change, the integration of value
information into decision support systems, and the determination of the
impact of alternative scales and scopes of analysis.

N2  - We construct a quantitative general equilibrium lifecycle model with
housing tenure decisions to investigate the degree to which wealth
inequality in the United States is affected by the preferential tax
treatment of home-ownership. Favorable tax treatment of owner occupied
housing in the form of home mortgage interest and property tax
deductibility, and the untaxed nature of imputed rents, provides a
financial incentive for home-ownership over renting as well as an
incentive to ``over-consume{''} housing since houses are not fungible.
Since the favorable tax treatment of housing disproportionately creates
tax savings for the upper quantiles of the income distribution, we
quantify how it contributes to the heavily right skewed distribution of
wealth in the United States using data from the Survey of Consumer
Finances. We consider a revenue-neutral government response to the
counter factual experiments of removing the current tax structure on
housing. Our quantitative analysis shows that, in terms of
distributional effects, removing all of the preferential tax treatments
results in an aggregate increase in welfare. However, we do not find any
reduction in inequality. We also find that while some re-allocation
toward financial assets occurs, households primarily increase their
consumption when imputed housing rents are taxed and the property tax
deduction is removed. Thus housing tax policy may be effective at
encouraging more overall saving through housing assets. (C) 2010

N2  - The aim of this study was to explore the perceptions of community
pharmacists towards the concept of pharmaceutical care, implementing
frequencies of pharmaceutical care, and barriers to implementation of
pharmaceutical care in China. A 38-item self-completion pre-tested
questionnaire was administered to a quota sample of 130 pharmacists in
community pharmacies in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, northwest China in
April 2008. Main outcome measures included understanding of
pharmaceutical care; perceived frequency of pharmaceutical care
activities; attitude towards pharmaceutical care; barriers to
implementation of pharmaceutical care. A response rate of 77.7%
(101/130) was achieved. The data were analysed descriptively. Factor
analysis was used to explore potential barriers to the provision of
pharmaceutical care. Respondents' understanding of the definition of
pharmaceutical care was not entirely satisfactory: it was widely but
incorrectly seen as a medication counselling service and many
pharmacists appeared to misunderstand their role in the process.
Respondents spent most of their work time performing prescription checks
and providing patients with directions for drug administration, dosage,
and precautions, but they tended to ignore health promotion within and
outside of pharmacy settings. Factor analysis suggested four factors
influencing the implementation of pharmaceutical care in the surveyed
community pharmacies: lack of external conditions for developing or
providing pharmaceutical care, lack of time and skills, absence of
information and economic incentive, and lack of full support from other
health professionals, with a cumulative variance of 64.7%. Cronbach's
alpha for the four factors was 0.71, 0.72, 0.69 and 0.74, respectively.
Although the respondent pharmacists had a certain degree of
understanding of the definition, aim, function and use of pharmaceutical
care, and carried out some activities currently, a range of barriers
need to be overcome before comprehensive pharmaceutical care becomes a
reality in China. These barriers could be overcome through participation
in effective continuing educational programmes, availability of more
resources, effective collaboration with other health professionals.

N2  - Objective: To identify the factors that encourage or discourage internal
medicine and pediatric residents regarding specializing in endocrinology
with a focus on diabetes.
Methods: We conducted an electronic survey of internal medicine and
pediatric residents using a $10 participation incentive. A total of 653
residents responded to the survey (estimated response rate of 9.2%)-626
from residency programs that were contacted for our survey and 27 from
referrals.
Results: Among internal medicine and pediatric residents surveyed, 39
respondents (6.0%) planned to specialize in endocrinology, and 27 of
these (4.1% of total respondents) planned to focus on diabetes.
``Intellectual satisfaction,{''} ``emotional satisfaction,{''} and
``work-life balance{''} were identified by respondents as the most
important factors in their choice of a specialty, with ratings of 5.5,
5.4, and 5.3 on a 6-point Likert scale. Among these factors identified
as most important to a medical career, endocrinology with a focus on
diabetes scored poorly with regard to intellectual and emotional
satisfaction but received high ranking with regard to lifestyle. With
regard to other factors, endocrinology was rated negatively on
``compensation,{''} ``number of procedures,{''} and ``patient adherence
to prescribed treatment.{''} Exposure to diabetes during training had no
major influence on the decision to enter endocrinology.
Conclusion: Endocrinology with a focus on diabetes care is not an
attractive specialty for most internal medicine and pediatric residents.
Therefore, new strategies to attract residents to the field of diabetes
care are needed.

N2  - Purpose
To investigate whether financial incentives could reverse the trend of
declining interest in primary care specialties among U.S. medical
students.
Method
An electronic survey was sent to all U.S. fourth-year MD and DO medical
students in 2009 with a Department of Defense service obligation.
Students not selecting a primary care residency were asked if a
hypothetical bonus paid before and after residency or an increase in
annual salary of attendings in primary care specialties would have
resulted in these students selecting primary care. Logistic regression
was used to determine student characteristics associated with accepting
a financial incentive.
Results
The survey response rate was 56% (447/797). Sixty-six percent of
students did not apply for a primary care residency. Of these, 30%
would have applied for primary care if they had been given a median
bonus of $27,500 (interquartile range {[}IQR] $15,000-$50,000) before
and after residency. Forty-one percent of students would have considered
applying for primary care for a median military annual salary after
residency of $175,000 (IQR $150,000-$200,000). Students who
considered primary care but chose a controllable lifestyle specialty
(e.g., radiology) were nearly four times more likely to name an
influential hypothetical salary than were students who did not consider
primary care and chose a noncontrollable lifestyle specialty (e.g.,
surgery) (67% versus 17%, P < .0001).
Conclusions
U.S. medical students, particularly those considering primary care but
selecting controllable lifestyle specialties, are more likely to
consider applying for a primary care specialty if provided a financial
incentive.

N2  - Surveys routinely offer incentives to motivate respondents and increase
the likelihood of their participation, yet surprisingly little is known
about the effectiveness of interviewer incentives. If interviewer
incentives increase interviewers' success in gaining cooperation, they
could help address declining survey response rates. In this article, we
present the results of an experiment testing the effectiveness of
interviewer incentives in the form of cash bonuses for each successfully
completed field interview. We did not find evidence that higher payments
to interviewers for each completion led to increased effort on the part
of interviewers nor did they lead to higher levels of success in
securing respondent cooperation. These findings suggest that per
complete interviewer incentives may not be cost effective in reducing
survey nonresponse.

To determine whether hospitals increase efforts on easy tasks relative

incentives.
Data Source
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Hospital Compare data
from Fiscal Years 2003 through 2005 and 2003 American Hospital
Association Annual Survey data.
Study Design
We classified measures of process compliance targeted by the Premier
Hospital Quality Incentive Demonstration as easy or difficult to improve
based on whether they introduce additional per-patient costs. We
compared process compliance on easy and difficult tasks at hospitals
eligible for P4P bonus payments relative to hospitals engaged in public
reporting using random effects regression models.
Principal Findings
P4P hospitals did not preferentially increase efforts for easy tasks in
patients with heart failure or pneumonia, but they did exhibit modestly
greater effort on easy tasks for heart attack admissions. There is no
systematic evidence that effort was allocated toward easier processes of
care and away from more difficult tasks.
Conclusions
Despite perverse P4P incentives to change allocation of efforts across
tasks to maximize performance scores at lowest cost, we find little
evidence that hospitals respond to P4P incentives as hypothesized.
Alternative incentive structures may motivate greater response by
targeted hospitals.

N2  - Background: Randomised controlled trials have investigated aspects of
postal survey design yet cannot elaborate on reasons behind
participants' decision making and survey behaviour. This paper reports
participants' perspectives of the design of, and participation in, a
longitudinal postal cohort survey. It describes strengths and weaknesses
in study design from the perspectives of study participants and aims to
contribute to the: 1) design of future cohort surveys and questionnaires
generally and, 2) design of cohort surveys for people with
musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) specifically.
Methods: In-depth interviews explored the design of postal surveys
previously completed by participants. Interviews used open ended
questioning with a topic guide for prompts if areas of interest were not
covered spontaneously. Thematic data analysis was undertaken based on
the framework method. A second researcher verified all coding.
Results: Data from fourteen interviews were analysed within three main
themes; participation, survey design and survey content. One of the main
findings was the importance of clear communication aimed at the correct
audience both when inviting potential participants to take part and
within the survey itself. Providing enough information about the study,
having a topic of interest and an explanation of likely benefits of the
study were important when inviting people to participate. The neutrality
of the survey and origination from a reputable source were both
important; as was an explanation about why information was being
collected within the survey itself. Study findings included
participants' impressions when invited to take part, why they
participated, the acceptability of follow-up of non-responders and why
participants completed the follow-up postal survey. Also discussed were
participants' first impression of the survey, its length, presentation
and participants' views about specific questions within the survey.
Conclusions: Ideas generated in this study provide an insight into
participants' decision making and survey behaviour and may enhance the
acceptability of future surveys to potential participants. As well as
clear communication, participants valued incentives and survey questions
that were relevant to them. However, opinions varied as to the preferred
format for responses with some advising more opportunity for open-ended
feedback. We also found that some standard format questions can raise
quandaries for individual participants.

Survey studies were employed using a whole count method with 26 meat
processing firms, and questions were prepared for in-depth firm level
interviews. The evaluations were accomplished on the basis of meat
processing capacities per day: 0.001-0.50, 0.51-1.0 and 1.1-3.0 tones,
classified as small, middle and large scale firms, respectively.
Although many good practices were carried out in the plants, the
``never{''} responses were found to be more prevalent in small scale
enterprises. It was found to be necessary to stress more vigorous
enforceable incentives for these businesses.

N2  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of
decentralised control on finished goods inventory levels in a
distribution system, and to identify the factors that determine the
overall inventory level.
Design/methodology/approach - The authors' study is based on a mixed
method approach using both a survey and semi-structured interviews to
assess inventory management practices and firm performance.
Findings - It was found that the common assumptions that distribution
outlets or dealers are homogenous and that their behaviour is uniform in
response to central control, such as the manufacturer's strategy, do not
hold in practice. In fact, the authors show that under conditions of
decentralised control, the inventories held at outlet level vary greatly
around the aggregate inventory at overall manufacturer level and in this
sense bear little resemblance to it. Amongst other conclusions, these
findings provide a possible explanation for previous studies'
inconclusive evidence on inventory reduction.
Research limitations/implications - The authors' research is based on
evidence from the automotive industry in the USA; future research may
include a wider industry analysis and geographical scope.
Practical implications - The paper identifies how incentives and
decision-making structures at the outlet level need to be considered in
order to derive decisions that are optimal at the supply chain level.
Originality/value - The paper extends the current literature on the
determinants of inventory levels by using dealer-level data, as opposed
to manufacturer or firm-level data in previous studies, thereby
identifying possible causes for the previously inconclusive evidence on
inventory levels in distribution systems.

The library conducted a survey in 2009 and seventy-eight geomatics
faculty participated in this investigation via email to examine what
kinds of professional materials they currently use to support teaching
and research, how they seek and acquire these documents, and which
library services they use most on campus. Questionnaire responses have
been tabulated to make the answers clearer and show the results more
intuitively. Some incentives were offered to stimulate faculty
participation. The survey disclosed many informative responses and also
indicated that the library was still the major document gathering
source; the faculty more likely used library electronic resources and
rarely used other library resources or services; journals and
international conference proceedings were the favorite materials for
teaching and research. Some ranking lists with reference value were also
provided, such as the most widely used foreign journals and
international proceedings, and the most familiar academic institutions,
publishers and university directories. The study pointed out that the
library could develop appropriate collections and services to meet the
faculty needs with the implication of the survey. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - This article surveys current security challenges and identifies
obstacles to effective global and regional responses and cooperation in
an era when security has become increasingly divisible. The new
situation is partly explained by the complexity and variety of security
challenges, both traditional and new, and by the linkages between them.
It argues that a new pattern of improvised, ad hoc and often
case-specific security mechanisms has developed, which it calls
Collective Conflict Management (CCM). The argument is illustrated by
reference to cases of CCM where a wide range of actors-multilateral
institutions at the global and regional levels, individual states or ad
hoc coalitions, professional and commercial bodies, and non-governmental
organizations-collaborate in an effort to manage specific security
threats and challenges, bringing together a variety of relationships,
resources and skills. The urge for collective action, rather than
unilateral or single actor-led, is motivated by a number of factors and
`drivers{''}, not all of them necessarily positive or constructive. The
article concludes that the success or failure of CCM will depend in part
on the severity of the problems it faces and in part on the motives and
incentives behind collective responses. This new pattern raises
interesting and important questions for the future of international
security. While CCM may be untidy and lack clear norms and standards, in
many cases it may be the best available in an increasingly fractured
world.

rates which created incentives for hospitals to control costs. Previous
studies found that elderly patients were discharged from hospital
`quicker and sicker' under PPS and concluded that families were coping
at home. We analyse a national longitudinal survey, the first National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and its Epidemiologic Followup
Study, which includes data on more outcomes over a longer period than
earlier studies. We find that the rate of admission to nursing homes
from the community in the first weeks after a hospital discharge more
than tripled under PPS, suggesting that families were not always able to
cope. As another response to sicker patients, discharges directly to
nursing homes from hospitals, which jumped initially under PPS, may have
risen further when payment rates were tightened in the early 1990s.
Hospital readmissions fell after the first few years. Our findings are
strengthened by the fact that we control for patients' health using
health information collected independently of hospital admission.

N2  - The majority of online research is now conducted via discontinuous
online access panels, which promise high response rates, sampling
control, access to populations that are hard to reach, and detailed
information about respondents. To sustain a critical mass of
respondents, overcome panel attrition and recruit new panel members,
marketers must understand how they can predict and explain what
motivates people to participate repeatedly in online surveys. Using the
newly developed survey participation inventory (SPI) measure, we
identify three clusters of participants, characterised as voicing
assistants, reward seekers and intrinsics. Our results suggest that most
online surveys are filled out by intrinsically motivated respondents
that show higher participation rates, response effort and performance;
incentives do not offer an important response motive.

N2  - Aims and objectives.
This study examines the impact of implementing a new pay system (Agenda
for Change) on nursing staff in the National Health Service (NHS) in the
UK. This new pay system covered approximately 400,000 nursing staff. Its
objectives were to improve the delivery of patient care as well as staff
recruitment, retention and motivation.
Background.
The new system aimed to provide a simplified approach to pay
determination, with a more systematic use of agreed job descriptions and
job evaluation to `price' individual jobs, linked to a new career
development framework.
Design.
Secondary analysis of survey data.
Methods.
Analysis of results of large-scale surveys of members of the Royal
College of Nursing of the United Kingdom (RCN) to assess the response of
nurses to questions about the implementation process itself and their
attitude to pay levels.
Results.
The results demonstrated that there was some positive change after
implementation of Agenda for Change in 2006, mainly some time after
implementation, and that the process of implementation itself raised
expectations that were not fully met for all nurses.
Conclusions.
There were clear indications of differential impact and reported
experiences, with some categories of nurse being less satisfied with the
process of implementation. The overall message is that a national pay
system has strengths and weaknesses compared to the local systems used
in other countries and that these benefits can only be maximised by
effective communication, adequate funding and consistent management of
the system.
Relevance to clinical practice.
How nurses' pay is determined and delivered can be a major satisfier and
incentive to nurses if the process is well managed and can be a factor
in supporting clinical practice, performance and innovation. This study
highlights that a large-scale national exercise to reform the pay system
for nurses is a major undertaking, carries risk and will take
significant time to implement effectively.

N2  - Background: Attrition from follow-up is a major methodological challenge
in randomized trials. Incentives are known to improve response rates in
cross-sectional postal and online surveys, yet few studies have
investigated whether they can reduce attrition from follow-up in online
trials, which are particularly vulnerable to low follow-up rates.
Objectives: Our objective was to determine the impact of incentives on
follow-up rates in an online trial.
Methods: Two randomized controlled trials were embedded in a large
online trial of a Web-based intervention to reduce alcohol consumption
(the Down Your Drink randomized controlled trial, DYD-RCT). Participants
were those in the DYD pilot trial eligible for 3-month follow-up (study
1) and those eligible for 12-month follow-up in the DYD main trial
(study 2). Participants in both studies were randomly allocated to
receive an offer of an incentive or to receive no offer of an incentive.
In study 1, participants in the incentive arm were randomly offered a 5
pound Amazon. co.uk gift voucher, a 5 pound charity donation to Cancer
Research UK, or entry in a prize draw for 250 pound. In study 2,
participants in the incentive arm were offered a 10 pound Amazon. co.uk
gift voucher. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who
completed follow-up questionnaires in the incentive arm(s) compared with
the no incentive arm.
Results: In study 1 (n = 1226), there was no significant difference in
response rates between those participants offered an incentive (175/615,
29%) and those with no offer (162/611, 27%) (difference = 2%, 95%
confidence interval {[}CI] -3% to 7%). There was no significant
difference in response rates among the three different incentives
offered. In study 2 (n = 2591), response rates were 9% higher in the
group offered an incentive (476/1296, 37%) than in the group not
offered an incentive (364/1295, 28%) (difference = 9%, 95% CI 5% to
12%, P < .001). The incremental cost per extra successful follow-up in
the incentive arm was 110 pound in study 1 and 52 pound in study 2.
Conclusion: Whereas an offer of a 10 pound Amazon. co.uk gift voucher
can increase follow-up rates in online trials, an offer of a lower
incentive may not. The marginal costs involved require careful
consideration.

N2  - Introduction
The US Public Health Service urges providers to screen patients for
smoking and advise smokers to quit. Yet, these practices are not widely
implemented in clinical practice. This study provides national estimates
of systems-level strategies used by private health insurance plans to
influence provider delivery of smoking cessation activities.
Methods
Data are from a nationally representative survey of health plans for
benefit year 2003, across product types offered by insurers, including
health maintenance organizations (HMOs), preferred provider
organizations, and point-of-service products, regarding alcohol,
tobacco, drug, and mental health services. Executive directors of 368
health plans responded to the administrative module (83% response
rate). Medical directors of 347 of those health plans, representing 771
products, completed the clinical module in which health plan respondents
were asked about screening for smoking, guideline distribution, and
incentives for guideline adherence.
Results
Only 9% of products require, and 12% verify, that primary care
providers (PCPs) screen for smoking. HMOs are more likely than other
product types to require screening. Only 17% of products distribute
smoking cessation guidelines to PCPs, and HMOs are more likely to do
this. Feedback to PCPs was most frequently used to encourage guideline
adherence; financial incentives were rarely used. Furthermore, health
plans that did require screening often conducted other cessation
activities.
Conclusion
Few private health plans have adopted techniques to encourage the use of
smoking cessation activities by their providers. Increasing health plan
involvement is necessary to reduce tobacco use and concomitant disease
in the United States.

N2  - Activities of commercial vehicles just before or just following
international border crossings are not well understood. Logistical
responses to border crossings are believed to increase miles traveled
empty, total travel times, and total vehicle emissions. Analysis of
observational data and surveys taken by commercial carriers at the
Cascade Gateway border crossings (between Whatcom County, Washington, in
the United States and lower British Columbia in Canada) improves
understanding of how the border and associated policies and regulations
affect logistics operations, both in manner and in scope. Findings
suggest that the border creates logistical incentives for trucks to
deadhead (cross the border without carrying goods as part of a
cross-border round-trip journey) and to make staging stops near the
border for border-related transloading. The Free and Secure Trade
program, as observed in the Cascade Gateway region, unintentionally
amplifies the existing negative logistical incentives created by the
border.

N2  - This paper discusses the responses of participants in an off-hour
delivery (OHD) pilot test to a postparticipation opinion survey. The
pilot test was part of a project that investigated the use of financial
incentives to receivers as a method to encourage OHD. The participants
in the pilot test included eight carriers and 25 receivers; 12 used
staffed OHD while the other 13 used unassisted OHD. In addition to the
survey responses, information obtained from in-depth interviews with six
of the participants provides insight into the operational benefits and
potential difficulties of implementing OHD. Analysis of the responses
indicates that carriers, receivers, and delivery drivers have a
generally very favorable impression of their participation in OHD and
shows that providing a financial incentive to receivers to encourage OHD
is beneficial. Carriers saw reductions in costs, drivers experienced
improved delivery conditions, and receivers saw substantial operational
improvements such as being able to make better use of their staff as a
result of the increased reliability of OHD. The potential of unassisted
OHD is evidenced by the fact that most participants who used unassisted
OHD during the pilot test continue to perform OHD without the financial
incentive that was provided during the pilot test.

N2  - This paper attempts to examine the effect of the intensity of financial
incentives (i.e. the proportion of workers' salary that is tied to
bonuses) on job satisfaction. Understanding the influence of monetary
incentives on job satisfaction is important given that the composition
of an employee's remuneration package is an integral element of his/her
overall working conditions. According to the standard microeconomic
paradigm, in long-run equilibrium one would not expect to observe any
differences in the marginal utilities of comparable workers under fixed
or variable payment schemes. This should hold since the expected value
of the higher wages paid under performance-related pay (PRP) should be
just sufficient to compensate for the additional earnings risk and the
disutility of extra effort. However, once the standard assumptions of
the agency model are relaxed, and psychological arguments such as those
of motivation crowding out theory (Frey and Jegen, 2001) are taken into
account, it is expected that PRP is likely to have a non-negligible
impact on job satisfaction. To the extent that incentive schemes allow
for optimization of effort, facilitate worker autonomy and enhance
self-determination they should increase job satisfaction, other things
equal. Yet increasing earnings risk, crowding out of the inherent
pleasantness in performing one's job and lower morale can lead to
disgruntled employees.
Based on the above reasoning, a number of previous studies have focussed
on the impact of the incidence of PRP on job satisfaction (Drago et al.,
1992; McCausland et al., 2005; Heywood and Wei, 2006; Green and Heywood,
2008; Artz, 2008; Pouliakas and Theodossiou, 2009). This masks the
possibility that the utility of workers may vary according to the
magnitude and intensity of incentives, as suggested by the experiments
of Gneezy and Rustichini (2000{[}a]{[}b]) and Pokorny (2008). An
important common element of the above experiments is that ``small{''}
incentives are likely to exert a negative effect on behaviour (with
discontinuity close to zero), while for high powered rewards (or
punishments) the standard price effect is expected to prevail.
This paper attempts to test these contrasting hypotheses by looking
beyond the mere incidence of incentive pay and examining the impact of
the intensity of incentives on job satisfaction instead. Specifically,
10 waves (1998-2007) of the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) are
used to investigate the ceteris paribus association between the
intensity of bonus/profit-sharing payments, the dynamic change in bonus
status and the utility derived from work. After controlling for
individual heterogeneity biases, it is shown that job utility rises only
in response to `generous' bonus payments, primarily in skilled,
non-unionized, private sector jobs. Evidence is also presented that
revoking a bonus from one year to the next is likely to have a
detrimental impact on employee utility, and that over time job
satisfaction tends to diminish as employees potentially adapt to the
payment of bonuses (Georgellis and Tabvuma, 2010). The findings of the
paper are therefore consistent with previous experimental evidence,
suggesting that employers wishing to motivate their staff should indeed
``pay enough or don't pay at all{''}.

N2  - Over-exploited fisheries are a common feature of the modern world and a
range of solutions including area closures (marine reserves; MRs),
effort reduction, gear changes, ecosystem-based management, incentives
and co-management have been suggested as techniques to rebuild
over-fished populations. Historic accounts of lobster (Jasus frontalis)
on the Chilean Juan Fernandez Archipelago indicate a high abundance at
all depths (intertidal to approximately 165 m), but presently lobsters
are found almost exclusively in deeper regions of their natural
distribution. Fishers' ecological knowledge (FEK) tells a story of
serial depletion in lobster abundance at fishing grounds located closest
to the fishing port with an associated decline in catch per unit effort
(CPUE) throughout recent history. We have re-constructed baselines of
lobster biomass throughout human history on the archipelago using
historic data, the fishery catch record and FEK to permit examination of
the potential effects of MRs, effort reduction and co-management
(stewardship of catch) to restore stocks. We employed a bioeconomic
model using FEK, fishery catch and effort data, underwater survey
information, predicted population growth and response to MR protection
(no-take) to explore different management strategies and their
trade-offs to restore stocks and improve catches. Our findings indicate
that increased stewardship of catch coupled with 30% area closure (MR)
provides the best option to reconstruct historic baselines. Based on
model predictions, continued exploitation under the current management
scheme is highly influenced by annual fluctuations and unsustainable. We
propose a community-based co-management program to implement a MR in
order to rebuild the lobster population while also providing
conservation protection for marine species endemic to the Archipelago.

N2  - Background: The control of blood-borne infections including HIV and
hepatitis C (HCV) amongst injecting drug users (IDUs) is a challenge for
health authorities in Iran. Hence, more reliable estimates of the levels
of blood-borne infections and their associated factors are critically
needed.
Methods: Active IDUs were recruited using peer-driven sampling in a
bio-behavioural survey in 2008. Over 8 weeks, data were collected from
adults living in a city in Isfahan Province who had injected drugs in
the past month. Participants provided a whole blood sample and answered
questions on sexual and drug-related risk characteristics. Participants
were provided post-test counselling and a non-monetary incentive for
their participation. Excluding two inactive cases, the initial recruits
resulted in 2-8 waves of recruitment.
Results: Overall, 118 IDUs including three females participated. The
estimated population proportions of HIV, hepatitis B. and HCV infections
were 0.7% (95% Cl, 0.6-2.3), 0.7% (95% Cl, 0.1-2.1), and 59.4%
(95% CI, 47.4-68.7), respectively. Responses indicated that 31%(95%
Cl, 20-44.5) of the IDUs ever shared a needle/syringe for drug
injection, and 77% (95% CI, 65-84) had ever injected an addictive
solution marketed widely as Temgesic. Multivariate analyses revealed
that the high prevalence of HCV infection amongst IDUs is associated
with the lifetime duration of drug injection (AOR, 1.17; 95% CI,
1.01-1.34) and with having injected Temgesic (AOR, 4.73; 95% Cl.
1.52-14.69).
Conclusion: Our experience in Iran indicates that IDUs can be recruited
effectively in a bio-behavioural survey through peer-driven sampling and
using only a single primary incentive. The high prevalence of HCV
associated with injecting Temgesic is important evidence for
harm-reduction policies in Iran. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Episodes of Depression with Venlafaxine ER for Two Years (PREVENT) study
were evaluated.
Methods: Adult outpatients with recurrent major depressive disorder
(MDD) and response or remission following 6-month continuation treatment
with venlafaxine extended release (ER) were randomized to receive
venlafaxine ER or placebo for 1 year. Patients without recurrence on
venlafaxine ER during year 1 were randomized to venlafaxine ER or
placebo for year 2. Psychosocial functioning was assessed using the
Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form
(Q-LES-Q), Life Enjoyment Scale-Short Version (LES-S), Social Adjustment
Scale-Self-Report (SAS-SR) total and individual factors, Short Form
Health Survey (SF-36) (vitality, social functioning, and role
function-emotional items), and Longitudinal Interval Follow-up
Evaluation (LIFE).
Results: At year 1 end, better overall psychosocial functioning was seen
among patients randomly assigned to venlafaxine ER (n = 129) vs placebo
(n = 129), with significant differences at end point on SF-36 role
function-emotional:Q-LES-Q and SAS-SR total, and work, house work,
social/leisure, and extended-family factor scores (p <= 0.05). At year 2
end, significant differences favored venlafaxine ER (n = 43) vs placebo
(n = 40) on SF-36 vitality and role function-emotional, Q-LES-Q LES-S,
LIFE, and SAS-SR total, social/leisure, and extended-family factor
scores (p <= 0.05).
Limitations: Patients with chronic MDD or treatment resistance were
excluded and long-term specialist care was a financial incentive for
treatment compliance. Discontinuation-related adverse events may have
compromised the integrity of the treatment blind.
Conclusions: For patients with recurrent MDD, 2 years' maintenance
therapy with venlafaxine ER may improve psychosocial functioning vs
placebo. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Several strategies have been proposed to reform physician
reimbursement while improving quality of care. Despite much debate,
physicians' opinions regarding reimbursement reform proposals have not
been objectively assessed.
Methods: We conducted a national survey of randomly selected physicians
between June 25 and October 31, 2009. Physicians rated their support for
several reimbursement reform proposals: rewarding quality with financial
incentives, bundling payments for episodes of care, shifting payments
from procedures to management and counseling services, increasing pay to
generalists, and offsetting increased pay to generalists with a
reduction in pay for other specialties. Support for the different reform
options was compared with physician practice characteristics.
Results: The response rate was 48.5% (n = 1222). Four of 5 physicians
(78.4%) indicated that under Medicare, some procedures are compensated
too highly and others are compensated at rates insufficient to cover
costs. Incentives were the most frequently supported reform option
(49.1%), followed by shifting payments (41.6%) and bundling (17.2%).
Shifting payments and bundling were more commonly supported by
generalists than by other specialists. There was broad support for
increasing pay for generalists (79.8%), but a proposal to offset the
increase with a 3% reduction in specialist reimbursement was supported
by only 39.1% of physicians.
Conclusions: Physicians are dissatisfied with Medicare reimbursement and
show little consensus for major proposals to reform reimbursement. The
successful adoption of payment reform proposals may require a better
understanding of physicians' concerns and their willingness to make
tradeoffs. Arch Intern Med. 2010;170(19):1735-1742

N2  - Background: Monetary incentives are an effective way of increasing
response rates to surveys, though they are generally less effective in
physicians, and are more effective when the incentive is paid up-front
rather than when made conditional on completion.
Methods: In this study we examine the effectiveness of pre- and
post-completion incentives on the response rates of all the neurologists
in the UK to a survey about conversion disorder, using a cluster
randomised controlled design. A postal survey was sent to all practicing
consultant neurologists, in two rounds, including either a book token,
the promise of a book token, or nothing at all.
Results: Three hundred and fifty-one of 591 eligible neurologists
completed the survey, for a response rate of 59%. While the
post-completion incentive exerted no discernible influence on response
rates, a pre-completion incentive did, with an odds-ratio of 2.1 (95%
confidence interval 1.5 - 3.0).
Conclusions: We conclude that neurologists, in the UK at least, may be
influenced to respond to a postal survey by a pre-payment incentive but
are unaffected by a promised reward.

addition, the public is willing to consider the use of financial
incentives to encourage patients to choose cheaper treatments, if
research demonstrates that they work as well as more expensive ones. The
second survey found that support for comparative effectiveness research
dropped in response to general debates about its consequences but that

N2  - Background: Nursing Home Compare first published clinical quality
measures at the end of 2002. It is a quality report card that for the
first time offers consumers easily accessible information about the
clinical quality of nursing homes. It led to changes in consumers'
demand, increasing the relative importance of clinical versus hotel
aspects of quality in their search and choice of a nursing home.
Objectives: To examine the hypothesis that nursing homes responding to
these changes in demand shifted the balance of resources from hotel to
clinical activities.
Subjects: The study included 10,022 free-standing nursing homes
nationwide during 2001 to 2006.
Research Design and Data: A retrospective multivariate statistical
analysis of trends in the ratio of clinical to hotel expenditures, using
Medicare cost reports, Minimum Data Set and Online Survey, Certification
and Reporting data, controlling for changes in residents' acuity and
facility fixed effects. Inference is based on robust standard errors.
Results: The ratio of clinical to hotel expenditures averaged 1.78. It
increased significantly (P < 0.001) by 5% following the publication of
the report card. The increase was larger and more significant among
nursing homes with worse reported quality, lower occupancy, those
located in more competitive markets, for-profit ownership and owned by a
chain.
Conclusions: The increase in the ratio of clinical to hotel expenditures
following publication of the report card suggests that nursing homes
responded as expected to the changes in the elasticity of demand with
respect to clinical quality brought about by the public reporting of
clinical quality measures. The response was stronger among nursing homes
facing stronger incentives.

N2  - This study expands upon existing knowledge of response rates by
conducting a large-scale quantitative review of published response
rates. This allowed a fine-grained comparison of response rates across
respondent groups. Other unique features of this study are the analysis
of response enhancing techniques across respondent groups and response
rate trends over time. In order to aid researchers in designing surveys,
we provide expected response rate percentiles for different survey
modalities.
We analyzed 2,037 surveys, covering 1,251,651 individual respondents,
published in 12 journals in I/O Psychology, Management, and Marketing
during the period 1995-2008. Expected response rate levels were
summarized for different types of respondents and use of response
enhancing techniques was coded for each study.
First, differences in mean response rate were found across respondent
types with the lowest response rates reported for executive respondents
and the highest for non-working respondents and non-managerial
employees. Second, moderator analyses suggested that the effectiveness
of response enhancing techniques was dependent on type of respondents.
Evidence for differential prediction across respondent type was found
for incentives, salience, identification numbers, sponsorship, and
administration mode. When controlling for increased use of response
enhancing techniques, a small decline in response rates over time was
found.
Our findings suggest that existing guidelines for designing effective
survey research may not always offer the most accurate information
available. Survey researchers should be aware that they may obtain
lower/higher response rates depending on the respondent type surveyed
and that some response enhancing techniques may be less/more effective
in specific samples.
This study, analyzing the largest set of published response rates to
date, offers the first evidence for different response rates and
differential functioning of response enhancing techniques across
respondent types.

N2  - Objective. Existing knowledge of evidence-based chronic disease
prevention is not systematically disseminated or applied. This study
investigated state and territorial chronic disease practitioners'
self-reported barriers to evidence-based decision making (EBDM).
Methods. In a nationwide survey, participants indicated the extent to
which they agreed with statements reflecting four personal and five
organizational barriers to EBDM. Responses were measured on a Likert
scale from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating a larger barrier to
EBDM. We analyzed mean levels of barriers and calculated adjusted odds
ratios for barriers that were considered modifiable through
interventions.
Results. Overall, survey participants (n=447) reported higher scores for
organizational barriers than for personal barriers. The largest reported
barriers to EBDM were lack of incentives/rewards, inadequate funding, a
perception of state legislators not supporting evidence-based
interventions and policies, and feeling the need to be an expert on many
issues. In adjusted models, women were more likely to report a lack of
skills in developing evidence-based programs and in communicating with
policy makers. Participants with a bachelor's degree as their highest
degree were more likely than those with public health master's degrees
to report lacking skills in developing evidence-based programs. Men,
specialists, and individuals with doctoral degrees were all more likely
to feel the need to be an expert on many issues to effectively make
evidence-based decisions.
Conclusions. Approaches must be developed to address organizational
barriers to EBDM. Focused skills development is needed to address
personal barriers, particularly for chronic disease practitioners
without graduate-level training.

N2  - Background: In recent years, response rates to telephone surveys have
declined. Online surveys may miss many older and poorer adults. Mailed
surveys may have promise in securing higher response rates.
Methods: In a pilot study, 1200 breast, prostate and colon patients,
randomly selected from the Pennsylvania Cancer Registry, were sent
surveys in the mail. Incentive amount ($3 vs. $5) and length of the
survey (10 pages vs. 16 pages) were randomly assigned.
Results: Overall, there was a high response rate (AAPOR RR4 = 64%).
Neither the amount of the incentive, nor the length of the survey
affected the response rate significantly. Colon cancer surveys were
returned at a significantly lower rate (RR4 = 54%), than breast or
prostate surveys (RR4 = 71%, and RR4 = 67%, respectively; p < .001 for
both comparisons). There were no significant interactions among cancer
type, length of survey and incentive amount in their effects on response
likelihood.
Conclusion: Mailed surveys may provide a suitable alternative option for
survey-based research with cancer patients.

N2  - Complete markets play an important role in terms of farmers `response to
price incentives and efficient resource allocation. The existence of
market failures in rural labor markets can be tested by examining
whether the quantity of labor demand is influenced by the household
characteristics. By applying existing approaches to separability tests
in the literature with a rich rural household survey, this paper
suggests that the household characteristics in rural Turkey have an
impact on labor demand. Further we link the nonseparability to some
well-known structural problems of Turkish agriculture such as hidden
unemployment and small and segmented lands creating constraints on
economic decisions. According to our findings, the lest Ails to reject
the separability for relatively larger farms and we do not reject
separability for a sub-sample of households having off-farm employment
opportunities.

N2  - Public discourse on migrant interactions with state welfare systems has
often assumed exploitative motivations on the part of migrants, with
charges of welfare tourism a recurring theme among segments of the
political spectrum. Academic research has also tended to characterise
migrant welfare utilisation in simple dichotomous terms where migrants
are either `welfare dependent' or not. This article argues for the
analytic utility of disaggregating the concept of welfare utilisation
into distinct component parts, denoting usage, participation and
dependency with regard to state-provided cash welfare benefits. Using EU
survey data, these distinct components of welfare utilisation among
migrants are assessed in comparative cross-national context, comparing
welfare and labour market outcomes for similar cohorts of migrants faced
with dissimilar incentive structures. The results have direct
implications for policy-makers, and for migrant experiences of social
citizenship, in so far as they show little support for the moral hazard
view of migrant interactions with welfare systems. Migrants in Ireland's
relatively more generous welfare system are seen to have no greater
likelihood of welfare dependency, and in fact show a lower usage of
welfare (as a proportion of total income) than similar migrants in
Britain, controlling for characteristics. Intriguingly, however, the
likelihood of forming a partial labour market attachment is seen to
respond to increasing levels of welfare usage in Ireland, but not in
Britain, suggesting that migrants may be taking an active role in how
they define their position in the work-welfare nexus in response to
welfare system incentives.

N2  - Objectives: To understand factors associated with primary care physician
research participation in a practice-based research network (PBRN) and
to compare perspectives by specialty.
Methods: We surveyed primary care internists, family physicians, and
pediatricians in Monroe County, New York, regarding their past
experience with research and incentives to participate in practice-based
research. We performed descriptive and tabular analyses to assess
perceptions and used chi(2) and analysis of variance to compare
perceptions across the 3 specialties.
Results: The response rate was 33%. The most frequently endorsed
aspects of collaboration were the opportunity to enact quality
improvement (78%), contribution to clinical knowledge (75%), and
intellectual stimulation (65%). Significant differences among the
primary care specialties were found in 2 aspects: (1) internists were
more likely to endorse additional source of income as ``important,{''}
and family medicine physicians were more likely to cite the opportunity
to shape research questions, projects, and journal articles as ``
important.{''}
Conclusion: Physicians across all 3 specialties cited the opportunity to
enact quality improvement and contribution to clinical knowledge as
important incentives to participating in practice-based research. This
supports the importance of strengthening the interface between research
and quality improvement in PBRN projects. Further study is needed to
assess reasons for differences among specialties if PBRNs are to become
successful in research involving adult patients. (J Am Board Fam Med

N2  - A questionnaire survey on health among students of higher education was
planned. To produce a response rate high enough for the analysis in a
cost-effective manner, a pilot study was carried out to test various
methods of data collection. Electronic invitation by the university
messaging system to fill a Web-based questionnaire, invitation by the
same means to fill paper-based questionnaires at a predefined place and
time with or without conditional incentives yielded response rates below
10%. Therefore, a combination of postal and Internet-based
questionnaires was used for data collection enhanced with a small
up-front gift and conditional incentives suggested by a student focus
group. This modality resulted in a 68.6% response rate (65.2% after
data cleaning). Those who responded through the Web were more likely to
be males and residing in larger settlements. However, no statistically
significant differences were observed on the primary health status
variables with respect to modality. Use of Web-based questionnaires is
recommended in combination with other data collection methods and

N2  - Our ability to design public policies that effectively promote the
efficient use of privately owned forest resources is underpinned by an
understanding of the way in which forest production and investment
decisions are made, and of how forest owners respond to changes in
social, economic, and institutional conditions. A model of
non-industrial private forest owners (NIPF) past harvesting behaviour
and future harvesting intentions using a logit approach is presented. A
Tobit model, which investigates harvesting intensity, is also developed.
The responses to a survey of 386 NIPF owners in Tasmania are used to
construct the data set consisting of socio-economic characteristics of
NIPF owners, their forest ownership objectives, and property
characteristics. The current study is innovative in that the role of
NIPF owner objectives and attitudes is assessed in three econometric
models exploring past harvesting behaviour, harvesting intensity, and
future harvesting intentions. A series of observations can be made from
comparing the results of the three models. For example, higher pulp
prices are unlikely to affect NIPF owners harvesting intentions but are
likely to increase harvesting intensity. The financial characteristics
of the NIPF owner contribute most to predicting future harvesting
intentions, with financial security being a disincentive to future
harvesting. Landowner objectives and attitudes are important in
explaining past harvesting activities and future intentions but do not
significantly affect harvesting intensity. Furthermore, there are
significant differences between different types of landowners in terms
of the incentives that are likely to make them change their mind about
participating in native forest harvesting.

N2  - Nonresponse bias has been a long- standing issue in survey research
(Brehm 1993; Dillman, Eltinge, Groves and Little 2002), with numerous
studies seeking to identify factors that affect both item and unit
response. To contribute to the broader goal of minimizing survey
nonresponse, this study considers several factors that can impact survey
nonresponse, using a 2007 Animal Welfare Survey Conducted in Ohio, USA.
In particular, the paper examines the extent to which topic salience and
incentives affect survey participation and item nonresponse, drawing on
the leverage-saliency theory (Groves, Singer and Corning 2000). We find
that participation in a survey is affected by its subject context (as
this exerts either positive or negative leverage on sampled units) and
prepaid incentives, which is consistent with the leverage-saliency
theory. Our expectations are also confirmed by the finding that item
nonresponse, our proxy for response quality, does vary by proximity to
agriculture and the environment (residential location, knowledge about
how food is grown, and views about the importance of animal welfare).
However, the data suggests that item nonresponse does not vary according
to whether or not a respondent received incentives.

N2  - In response to concern about the loss of ecosystem services once
provided by natural riparian systems, state and federal agencies have
established incentive programs for landowners to convert sensitive lands
from agricultural to conservation uses. Enhancement of wildlife habitat,
while identified as a function of such systems, has often been of
secondary importance to soil conservation and water quality objectives.
Though greatly important, little consideration has been given to how
specific species will respond to the design and management of riparian
buffers or other conservation lands. This study compared avian
communities within a chronosequence of riparian buffers established on
previously cropped or pastured land with those of the nearby matrix land
cover types (row crop fields and an intensively grazed pasture). The
riparian buffers consisted of native grasses, forbs, and woody
vegetation established at three different times (2, 9, and 14+ years
prior to survey). At each site, 10 min point counts for breeding birds
were conducted using 50 m fixed radius plots, which were visited eight
times between May 15 and July 10, 2008. A total of 54 bird species were
observed over all of the study sites. The re-established riparian
buffers in this study had higher bird abundance, richness, and diversity
than the crop and pasture sites. These results suggest that
re-establishing native riparian vegetation in areas of intensive
agriculture will provide habitat for a broad suite of bird species, but
that specific species will reflect successional stage, horizontal and
vertical vegetative structure, and compositional diversity of the buffer
vegetation. These results emphasize the importance of matching buffer
design and management to species requirements if the objectives are to
attract specific target species or species groups.

N2  - Differences in economic opportunities give rise to strong migration
incentives, across regions within countries, and across countries. In
this paper we focus on responses to differences in welfare benefits
across States within the United States. We apply the model developed in
Kennan and Walker (2008), which emphasizes that migration decisions are
often reversed, and that many alternative locations must be considered.
We model individual decisions to migrate as a job search problem. A
worker starts the life-cycle in some home location and must determine
the optimal sequence of moves before settling down. The model is
sparsely parameterized. We estimate the model using data from the
National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (1979). Our main finding is that
income differences do help explain the migration decisions of young
welfare-eligible women, but large differences in benefit levels provide
surprisingly weak migration incentives. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All

to evaluate the use of lottery tickets as incentives in an epidemiologic
control group. A self-administered questionnaire was sent to parents in
the municipality of Stockholm, Sweden, who were to be used as a control
group in a study addressing stress in parents of children with cancer. A
stratified random sample of 450 parents were randomized into three
incentive groups: (a) no incentive; (b) a promised incentive of one
lottery ticket to be received upon reply; (c) a promised incentive of
one lottery ticket to be received upon reply and an additional lottery
ticket upon reply within 1 week. The overall response rate across the
three groups was 65.3%. The response rate was highest in the no
incentive group (69.3%) and lowest in the one plus one lottery ticket
group (62.0%). In a survival analysis, the difference between the two
response curves was significant by the log-rank test (P = 0.04), with
the no incentive group having a shorter time to response than the
incentive group. Our findings suggest that the use of lottery tickets as
incentives to increase participation in a mail questionnaire among
parents may be less valuable or even harmful. Incentives may undermine
motivation in studies in which the intrinsic motivation of the
respondents is already high.

N2  - Background: The successful incorporation of research into the future
careers of residents provides tremendous potential for increasing
scientific orthopaedic inquiry and improving musculoskeletal care.
Therefore, we sought to assess resident opinions regarding plans and
incentives for future research and the opinions of academic chairs who
must support them.
Methods: Residents from sixteen departments were surveyed with a
twenty-four-question online survey. Similar surveys were sent to chairs
of all residency-sponsoring departments.
Results: The response rate was 44% (183) for the residents and 60%
(eighty-six) for the chairs. Forty-two percent of the residents felt
certain or likely that they would perform research during their careers,
and 28% were undecided. Ninety-nine percent thought that orthopaedic
surgeons performing research is important to clinical orthopaedics.
Ninety-three percent of the residents expressed the need for monetary
incentives for research, but only 40% would help to provide it. Chairs
similarly noted the importance of research subsidization (92%) and a
willingness to support it (70%). Residents indicated that increased
funding and protected time would provide the greatest incentives for
research during residency; chairs agreed. After training, debt relief
and salary support were most important for residents; chairs chose
protected time and a chair who is supportive of research as most
important. Primary authorship on a prior manuscript and past research
experience were found to be associated with greater future research
interest in univariate analyses; primary authorship maintained an
independent association in multivariate analysis. Younger residents and
women were more likely to be unsure of their research interest.
Conclusions: Many orthopaedic residents in training have interest in
integrating research into their future practice and support the research
mission of orthopaedic surgeons. Our results may aid in identifying
residents with high research interest (and those unsure) and help to
guide the provision of incentives to actuate those interests.
Clinical Relevance: Increasing the future research potential of
residents will help to spur scientific investigation, which serves as
the foundation for evidence-based clinical orthopaedic care.

N2  - Background: Nonresponse to questionnaires can affect the validity of
surveys and introduce bias. Offering financial incentives can increase
response rates to postal questionnaires, but the effect of financial
incentives on response rates to online surveys is less clear.
Objective: As part of a survey, we aimed to test whether knowledge of a
financial incentive would increase the response rate to an online
questionnaire.
Methods: A randomized controlled trial of 485 UK-based principal
investigators of publicly funded health services and population health
research. Participants were contacted by email and invited to complete
an online questionnaire via an embedded URL. Participants were randomly
allocated to groups with either ``knowledge of{''} or ``no knowledge or
a financial incentive (10 Amazon gift voucher) to be provided on
completion of the survey. At the end of the study, gift vouchers were
given to all participants who completed the questionnaire regardless of
initial randomization status. Four reminder emails (sent from the same
email address as the initial invitation) were sent out to nonrespondents
at one, two, three, and four weeks; a fifth postal reminder was also
undertaken. The primary outcome measure for the trial was the response
rate one week after the second reminder. Response rate was also measured
at the end of weeks one, two, three, four, and five, and after a postal
reminder was sent.
Results: In total, 243 (50%) questionnaires were returned (232
completed, 11 in which participation was declined). One week after the
second reminder, the response rate in the ``knowledge{''} group was 27%
(66/244) versus 20% (49/241) in the ``no knowledge{''} group (x(1)(2) =
3.0, P = .08). The odds ratio for responding among those with knowledge
of an incentive was 1.45 (95% confidence interval {[}CI] 0.95 - 2.21).
At the third reminder, participants in the ``no knowledge{''} group were
informed about the incentive, ending the randomized element of the
study. However we continued to follow up all participants, and from
reminder three onwards, no significant differences were observed in the
response rates of the two groups.
Conclusions: Knowledge of a financial incentive did not significantly
increase the response rate to an online questionnaire. Future surveys
should consider including a randomized element to further test the
utility of offering incentives of other types and amounts to participate
in online questionnaires.

N2  - Object. Deformational plagiocephaly (DP) is the leading cause of head
shape abnormalities in infants. Treatment options include conservative
measures and cranial molding. Pediatric neurosurgeons and craniofacial
plastic surgeons have yet to agree on an ideal therapy, and no definable
standards exist for initiating treatment with helmets. Furthermore,
there may be differences between specialties in their perceptions of DP
severity and need for helmet therapy.
Methods. Requests to participate in a web-based questionnaire were sent
to diplomates of the American Board of Pediatric Neurological Surgery
and US and Canadian members of the Pediatric Joint Section of the
American Association of Neurological Surgeons and the Congress of
Neurological Surgeons and the American Cleft Palate Craniofacial
Association. Questions focused on educational background; practice
setting; volume of DP patients; preferences for evaluation, treatment,
follow-up; and incentives or deterrents to treat with helmet therapy.
Six examples of varying degrees of DP were presented to delineate
treatment preferences.
Results. Requests were sent to 302 neurosurgeons and 470 plastic
surgeons, and responses were received from 71 neurosurgeons (24%) and
64 plastic surgeons (14%). The following responses represented the
greatest variations between specialties: 1) 8% of neurosurgeons and
26% of plastic surgeons strongly agreed with the statement that helmet
therapy is more beneficial than conservative therapy (p < 0.01); and 2)
25% of neurosurgeons and 58% of plastic surgeons would treat moderate
to severe DP with helmets (p < 0.01).
Conclusions. Survey responses suggest that neurosurgeons are less likely
to prescribe helmet therapy for DP than plastic surgeons. Parents of
children with DP are faced with a costly treatment decision that may be
influenced more strongly by referral and physician bias than medical
evidence. (DOI: 10.3171/2009.11.PEDS0983)

N2  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the teaching effort
and associated resources across variously sized academic and nonacademic
hospitals across the country.
Methods: A simple survey was constructed and distributed nationally to
academic and nonacademic radiology departments of attending-level
radiologists with residency programs. The survey queried human and
financial resources used for education in the department or division in
comparison with compensated human and financial resources for this
effort.
Results: Sixty institutions across the country were surveyed, with 40
surveys returned from 35 unique institutions, representing a 67%
response rate. All respondents reported performing teaching duties. The
average teaching in departments was 30 hours per week, including
teaching a wide scope of constituents, including trainees, colleagues,
and allied staff members. The majority of teaching was spent on teaching
medical students, residents, and fellows as well as referring physicians
at multidisciplinary rounds. The commitment of dedicated full-time
equivalent staff members and funding to teaching was limited, with 45%
of respondents without dedicated full-time equivalents for teaching and
just over 7% of the teaching funded. Eighty percent of institutions
surveyed provided some amount of weekly academic time during which many
staff members carried out their teaching preparations.
Conclusions: Respondent radiology departments reported significant
resource and manpower allocations to teaching efforts, in particular to
trainees and referring physicians. However, limited compensation or
incentives are allocated to this effort with regard to both human and
financial resources. Compensated, allotted staff academic time may help
offset the lack of dedicated educational resources to the teaching
effort of radiology departments.

N2  - The purpose of this qualitative study was to identify a common language
for ``wellness'' and a correlating health cost trend reduction through
incentive-driven prevention and wellness. Mapping the results of the
survey with the trend lines reported by innovative employers could
uncover increased financial value in health investments. A 10-question
survey was designed for telephone interviews with 26 businesses (
Innovators) from the Board of the Center for Health Value Innovation; a
paper-based survey with the same questions was completed by attendees at
a seminar. Then, an online trend survey was conducted with members of
the Board ( Innovators) to track the total health cost trends in their
companies over the past 3-4 years. Responses were compared and analysis
of alignment and differences were recorded by graphing. The trend survey
results were mapped and tracked with weighted averages. Innovators'
responses to the phone survey showed broader definitions of ``wellness''
than other companies, with little difference in the Innovators'
responses when subdivided by size of company. The online trend survey
showed that companies that provided incentives for wellness averaged a
trend of 4% over the past 3-4 years-approximately 50% of the national
trends of 8%-10% over the same time frame. Innovators have defined
wellness in ways that would accelerate adoption in the broader business
community and drive implementation of wellness programs. The bigger win
could be the community-level shift to a culture of health as employees
carry these health competencies to the next business in the community. (

N2  - Introduction: Retention of rehabilitation therapists (RTs) in rural
areas is a growing problem in rural Australia. Current literature
demonstrates that private allied health professionals in general remain
longer in rural areas than those working in the public sector. However,
government focus to enhance retention has been on those employed in the
public sector, offering private practitioners little incentive to stay
rural. There has been an absence of policy commitment to attracting
private professionals to rural areas or offering rural practitioners
options for mixing private and public service. This study aimed to
explore the thoughts and perceptions of private RTs in rural areas
concerning their incorporation into broader rural health policies and
concomitant programs.
Methods: An online survey was sent to a purposively chosen sample of RTs
in rural Victoria. Participants were selected from publicly available
internet listings and were contacted via email. Possible participants
were limited to those who had an email address and to those on three
available professional lists (physiotherapy, occupational therapy and
speech pathology). The survey consisted of 29 questions: eight related
to the perceived place that practitioners in rural areas occupy; eight
related to their professional practice; seven related to retention
policies; two related to education and training; and four were
demographic questions.
Results: A total of 72 RTs completed the survey and were included in the
analysis (40% response rate). The overwhelming majority of respondents
were in favour of having partnerships between private and public
practice in rural and regional areas and of governments developing
programs to facilitate such partnerships. In total, 26% of respondents
currently worked in some form of partnership with public agencies. There
was also a reasonable response to the use of government incentives to
retain and attract private practitioners to rural and regional areas.
Conclusions: The results of this research indicate that many private RTs
in Victoria perceived their greater involvement in the delivery of
public health in rural areas in a positive manner.

knowledge of guidelines for lymph node (LN) assessment in gastric cancer
demonstrated a knowledge deficit. To understand factors affecting
optimal assessment we surveyed pathologists to identify external
barriers.
Methods: pathologists were identified using two Ontario physician
databases and Surveyed Online or by mail. with a 40% response rate.
Results: The majority (56%) of pathologists stated assessing an
additional five LNs would 1101 be a burden. Most (80%) pathologists
disagreed with pay for performance for achieving quality standards.
Qualitative analysis determined the majority of pathologists believed
achieving quality standards was inherent to their profession and should
not require incentives. Poor surgical specimen wits identified as a
barrier and underscores the importance of aiming (quality improvement

Conclusion: In addition to education, tailoring an intervention to
address all barriers, including laboratory constraints may be an
effective means of improving gastric cancer care. J. Oncol.

N2  - Survey response rates have been declining over the past several decades,
particularly for random-digit-dialing (RDD) telephone surveys (see de
Leeuw and de Heer 2002; Steeh 1981). This trend affects research panels
such as the Gallup Panel, which uses RDD methodology to recruit its
members. If significant improvements in panel recruitment response rates
are to be achieved, new approaches must be considered. This paper
presents the findings of a mail and telephone mode experiment conducted
by the Gallup Panel to analyze the individual and combined effects of
incentives, advance letters, and follow-up telephone calls on the panel
recruitment response rate. Study results indicate that the mail
recruitment approach nets a higher panel response rate, and that the
cost-effectiveness of the mail recruitment approach is significantly
greater than the telephone recruitment approach. Study results also
suggest that the advance letter, incentive, and telephone follow-up
conditions all have independent, positive influences on the response
rate; and that the groups that receive an advance letter, that receive
incentives, and that receive a follow-up telephone call have higher
panel recruitment response rates than the control group.

N2  - Background: While there is considerable research on medical workforce
supply trends, there is little research examining the determinants of
labour supply decisions for the medical workforce. The ``Medicine in
Australia: Balancing Employment and Life (MABEL){''} study investigates
workforce participation patterns and their determinants using a
longitudinal survey of Australian doctors. It aims to generate evidence
to support developing effective policy responses to workforce issues
such as shortages and maldistribution. This paper describes the study
protocol and baseline cohort, including an analysis of response rates
and response bias.
Methods/Design: MABEL is a prospective cohort study. All Australian
doctors undertaking clinical work in 2008 (n = 54,750) were invited to
participate, and annual waves of data collections will be undertaken
until at least 2011. Data are collected by paper or optional online
version of a questionnaire, with content tailored to four sub-groups of
clinicians: general practitioners, specialists, specialists in training,
and hospital non-specialists. In the baseline wave, data were collected
on: job satisfaction, attitudes to work and intentions to quit or change
hours worked; a discrete choice experiment examining preferences and
trade-offs for different types of jobs; work setting; workload;
finances; geographic location; demographics; and family circumstances.
Discussion: The baseline cohort includes 10,498 Australian doctors,
representing an overall response rate of 19.36%. This includes 3,906
general practitioners, 4,596 specialists, 1,072 specialists in training,
and 924 hospital non-specialists. Respondents were more likely to be
younger, female, and to come from non-metropolitan areas, the latter
partly reflecting the effect of a financial incentive on response for
doctors in remote and rural areas. Specialists and specialists in
training were more likely to respond, whilst hospital non-specialists
were less likely to respond. The distribution of hours worked was
similar between respondents and data from national medical labour force
statistics. The MABEL survey provides a large, representative cohort of
Australian doctors. It enables investigation of the determinants of
doctors' decisions about how much, where and in what circumstances they
practice, and of changes in these over time. MABEL is intended to
provide an important resource for policy makers and other stakeholders
in the Australian medical workforce.

N2  - Students' perception of their overall academic experience and the campus
environment is related to academic accomplishment, and research has
found that the designed environment of the university can influence the
degree of stress students may feel. Past research found that
undergraduate student use of campus green spaces and perceptions of
quality of life were related to each other. The main objective of this
study was to investigate the relationship between graduate student use
of campus green spaces and their perceptions of quality of life at a
university in Texas. A total of 347 of 3279 (approximate to 10%) of the
graduate student body received e-mails with information regarding the
incentive for participation and instructions on accessing an on-line
survey. The survey included questions that related to student use of
campus green spaces, overall quality of life statements, an instrument
to measure the quality of life of university students, and demographic
questions. A total of 79 (22.8% response rate) graduate student
questionnaires were collected and analyzed to compare perceptions of
quality of life of university students and the level of individual usage
of campus green spaces. Descriptive statistics determined that, unlike
undergraduates who were primarily ``high users{''} of campus green
spaces, graduate students were about equally split between being
``low,{''} ``medium,{''} and ``high users{''} of campus green spaces.
However, graduate students still ranked their quality of life highly.
Finally, this study found that, unlike undergraduates, graduate students
did not have a statistically significant relationship between green-user
scores and perception of quality of life scores. It may be that graduate
students have less time to spend in outdoor spaces, yet still meet their
quality of life needs through other means such as academic achievements.

N2  - BACKGROUND: To achieve high participation rates and a representative
sample, active parent consent procedures require a significant
investment of study resources. The purpose of this article is to
describe processes and outcomes of utilizing active parent consent
procedures with sixth-grade students from urban, ethnically diverse,
economically disadvantaged K-8 public schools involved in an evaluation
of a middle school service-learning program.
METHODS: As part of the evaluation of the Lead Peace-Plus
service-learning program, active parent consent was obtained for
participation in school-based health surveys conducted with sixth
graders in 3 schools. To achieve acceptable rates of parent permission,
we employed multiple procedures including regular communication with
school staff, incentives for involved schools and teachers, a
multipronged approach for reaching parents, and direct encouragement of
students to return forms through repeated classroom visits, individual
and classroom incentives. We used Fisher's exact tests to compare
selected characteristics among students whose parents weren't reached,
those whose parents refused, and those whose parents consented to survey
participation.
RESULTS: We achieved a parent response rate of 94.6% among sixth-grade
students. No significant differences in student gender, race/ethnicity,
school, or free/reduced lunch status were identified across parent
consent status groups. Rates of absenteeism were significantly higher (p
= .03) among students whose parents weren't reached compared to other
groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Employing a multifaceted active parent consent campaign can
result in high rates of parental response with limited sampling bias
among an urban, ethnically diverse and economically disadvantaged group
of middle school students.

N2  - Most analyses of the effect of incentives on response rates have
attempted to extrapolate to the Internet the already existing broad
knowledge base of methodologies for personal surveys by telephone and
post. However, Such knowledge about existing methods is not directly
applicable to the Internet-based interviews. This Study therefore
examines the manner in which different combinations of incentives can
affect response to a survey over the Internet. With Such a purpose
incentives have been chosen based on draws that has been administered
under the pre-incentives philosophy (giving the possibility to
participate in a draw, independently that the questionnaire was stuffed
or not) or post-incentives (giving the possibility to participate in a
draw only those that stuffed the questionnaire). A surprising result is
that the joint use of pre-incentives and post-incentives slightly
improves response rates, although it also Causes rates to be
considerably lower than when these incentives are used separately.

N2  - Background: Electronic clinical decision support (CDS) is increasingly
establishing its role in evidence-based clinical practice. Considerable
evidence supports its enhancement of efficiency in e-Prescribing, but
some controversy remains. This study evaluated the practicality and
identified the perceived benefits of, and barriers to, its future
adoption in the West of Ireland.
Methods: This cross sectional study was carried out by means of a
27-part questionnaire sent to 262 registered general practitioners in
Counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon. The survey domains encompassed
general information of individual's practice, current use of CDS and the
practitioner's attitudes towards adoption of CDS-eP. Descriptive and
inferential analyses were performed to analyse the data collected.
Results: The overall response rate was 37%. Nearly 92% of respondents
employed electronic medical records in their practice. The majority
acknowledged the value of electronic CDS in improving prescribing
quality (71%) and reducing prescribing errors (84%). Despite a high
degree of unfamiliarity (73%), the practitioners were open to the use
of CDS-eP (94%) and willing to invest greater resources for its
implementation (62%). Lack of a strategic implementation plan (78%) is
the main perceived barrier to the incorporation of CDS-eP into clinical
practice, followed by i) lack of financial incentives (70%), ii) lack
of standardized product software (61%), iii) high sensitivity of
drug-drug interaction or medication allergy markers (46%), iv) concern
about overriding physicians' prescribing decisions(44%) and v) lack of
convincing evidence on the systems' effectiveness (22%).
Conclusions: Despite favourable attitudes towards the adoption of
CDS-eP, multiple perceived barriers impede its incorporation into
clinical practice. These merit further exploration, taking into
consideration the structure of the Irish primary health care system,
before CDS-eP can be recommended for routine clinical use in the West of
Ireland.

N2  - Like many of its neighbours. Thailand is increasingly interested in
upgrading the technological capability of its indigenous firms through
the inward investment (foreign direct investment, FDI) of transnational
enterprises (TNEs). Its science and technology policies, however, remain
fragmented, and they compete with regional distribution priorities. This
paper examines the nature of technology transfer between Asian TNEs
(Japan and the newly industrializing economies (NIEs), that is, the NIEs
of Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan) and Thai firms based on
the responses of some 145 firms from a 2005 survey. It finds only modest
levels of technological transfer in production and process technologies.
Asian TNEs evaluate factor cost advantages and government incentives
favourably. Logistic regressions, however, indicate that government
incentives are negatively related to technology process modification
between NIE subsidiaries and Thai customers. But, the technical training
of Thai workers significantly increases the likelihood of Asian
subsidiaries undertaking process technology transfers. Among NIE firms,
the ability to import foreign skilled labour further increases the
likelihood of such technological activities. Finally, forward linkages
among the NIEs are positively associated with fill?, location in the
urban agglomerations of Bangkok and Chon Buri, and, among smaller firms.
Our study suggests that prevailing FDI policies have little influence on
technology transfer, while technology policies that favour large TNEs
work against smaller NIEs that are engaged in modest technology
transfer.

N2  - Are economic incentives and regulatory relief useful tools for
encouraging reuse of abandoned or under-utilised urban sites with
historic buildings? Answering this question is of key importance for
many European cities and for older US cities, and has important
implications in terms of urban sustainability and osmart growtho
initiatives. This study uses conjoint choice experiments to explore the
relative importance of economic incentives, regulatory relief, land use
and property regime offerings at under-utilised historic sites in
Venice, Italy. Real estate developers and investors were surveyed, and
asked to choose between pairs of hypothetical projects in three Venice
locations, as well as between one of these projects and the alternative
to do a development project elsewhere. Statistical models of the
responses to these choice questions indicate that respondents were
sensitive to the price of acquiring the land (and hence to any policies
that influence prices), and particularly sensitive to the property
regime that would be granted to developers and investors and to the
allowable land use. It is concluded that the city should focus on
offering land uses and property regimes that are more in tune with
developer demand.

addition of a pen only did not improve response proportion. These
findings support the use of $1 bill but not a pen alone as an effective
incentive to increase response proportions to a postal questionnaire.

N2  - The Greater Cincinnati Household Travel Survey (HTS) is a
proof-of-concept study for replacing travel diaries with a large-scale
multi-day Global Positioning System (GPS) survey. The objectives are to
collect multiple-day data from more than 3,000 households with portable
GPS devices and improve existing processing software to provide data
that support modeling approaches in Ohio. No diaries are collected for
household members younger than 12 years old. A subsample of follow-up
prompted recall surveys allow respondents to review GPS interpreted
travel information for verification. This paper, with data from the
spring 2009 pilot, describes the survey process developed for this HTS.
It documents that with an address-based sample frame, advance letters,
and Internet and phone recruiting, a significant subsample of cell phone
only households can be recruited and surveyed with GPS; a representative
sample of households can be recruited for a GPS-based survey, based on a
comparison of pilot sample household characteristics with available
Public Use Microdata Samples data; and response rates for
difficult-to-reach households such as cell phone only, lower income, and
zero-vehicle households can be improved with a cash incentive ($25).
The paper provides principles and describes the prompted recall survey
developed to obtain additional data from a subset of respondents beyond
the GPS recorded travel for improving imputation software.

N2  - A route-based incentive program is introduced in which drivers are
rewarded for taking the safest routes. The program is operated with an
incentive structure by a logistics company and a variable insurance
premium scheme by an insurance company. The logistics company offers
incentives to its drivers to follow the safest routes and by doing so
expects to pay lower insurance premiums for its vehicles. The insurance
company charges a discounted premium for vehicles that follow the safest
routes, while expecting to pay less for potential accident claims. The
theoretical framework, including the setup of the incentive structure
and the variable premium scheme, is presented in this paper. Conditions
for the existence of a win win situation are established in which
drivers, the logistics company, and the insurance company all benefit
from the program. Optimization of the incentive program is also
formulated as a bilevel programming problem. An online before-and-after
survey is conducted to assess drivers' response to incentives.
Forty-five Dutch professional drivers participated in the survey. The
results show that drivers tend to ignore safety-related information in
making their route choices; however, the incentives have some
significant effects on these choices. The incentives therefore present
an effective way of influencing drivers' route choices.

N2  - This article asks which Subgroups of the population are affected by the
payment of a Small cash incentive to respond to a telephone Survey with
a listed sample. We find that a promised incentive improves response
rates primarily amongst those individuals with the longest history of
income Support receipt. Importantly, these individuals are least likely
to respond to the survey in the absence of all incentive. The incentive
thus improves both average response rates and acts to equalize response
rates across different socio-economic groups, potentially reducing
nonresponse bias. Interestingly, the main channel through which the
incentive appears to increase response rates is in improving the
probability of making contact with individuals in the group with heavy
exposure to the income support system.

N2  - Background: Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA), a modelling
approach, is used to assess health risks. Inputs into the QMRA process
include data that characterise the intensity, frequency and duration of
exposure to risk(s). Data gaps for water exposure assessment include the
duration and frequency of urban non-potable (non-drinking) water use.
The primary objective of this study was to compare household water usage
results obtained using two data collection tools, a computer assisted
telephone interview (CATI) and a 7-day water activity diary, in order to
assess the effect of different methodological survey approaches on
derived exposure estimates. Costs and logistical aspects of each data
collection tool were also examined.
Methods: A total of 232 households in an Australian dual reticulation
scheme (where households are supplied with two grades of water through
separate pipe networks) were surveyed about their water usage using both
a CATI and a 7-day diary. Householders were questioned about their use
of recycled water for toilet flushing, garden watering and other outdoor
activities. Householders were also questioned about their water use in
the laundry. Agreement between reported CATI and diary water usage
responses was assessed.
Results: Results of this study showed that the level of agreement
between CATI and diary responses was greater for more frequent
water-related activities except toilet flushing and for those activities
where standard durations or settings were employed. In addition, this
study showed that the unit cost of diary administration was greater than
for the CATI, excluding consideration of the initial selection and
recruitment steps.
Conclusion: This study showed that it is possible to successfully
`remotely' coordinate diary completion providing that adequate
instructions are given and that diary recording forms are well designed.
In addition, good diary return rates can be achieved using a monetary
incentive and the diary format allows for collective recording, rather
than an individual's estimation, of household water usage. Accordingly,
there is merit in further exploring the use of diaries for collection of
water usage information either in combination with a mail out for
recruitment, or potentially in the future with Internet-based
recruitment (as household Internet uptake increases).

N2  - Fishers' attitudes and perceptions are critical for the success of
fisheries protection areas with their associated biota. and a failure to
understand fishers' behaviour may undermine the success of such
fisheries management measures. In this study, we examine fishers'
perception of a long-established exclusive fisheries zone around Malta
and to investigate if the perceptions depend on fishers' demographic,
economic, social characteristics and fishing activity of the fishers. A
questionnaire survey was undertaken to evaluate the demographic
characteristics, economic situation (costs and revenue) and fishers'
activity and behaviour, together with their perception of the Fisheries
Management Zone (FMZ). A total of 241 interview responses were analysed
which was a response rate of 60%. The perception of most fishers was
that the establishment of the FMZ has had an overall negative impact on
their fishing activity and that the zone is not important for the
protection of local fish stocks. When asked about the beneficial effect
of the zone for fishers, most fishers from all backgrounds said that the
zone does not benefit commercial fishers, but benefits mainly
recreational fishers. The most evident differences in the perceptions
and attitudes were between the full-time, part-time and recreational
fishers. Fishers that have been fishing for more than 35 years and
fishers from the main fishing village also had different attitudes from
other fishers towards the FMZ. The results of this study suggest that
the proportion of individual income derived from fishing was the
strongest factor that influenced attitudinal differences, with home port
and fishing experience having less important effects. The main
differences in attitude among fishers were related to the protection and
conservation effects of the zone, enhancement of resources and conflicts
among user groups. The heterogeneity among fishers' attitudes revealed
by the present study has important implications for the implementation
of spatial closures. Some sectors of stakeholders may require additional
incentives to accept restrictions on access if spatial management is to
achieve its intended objectives. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

systems, incentives, perceptions of access to care, use of health

in the adoption of IT. U. S. doctors were the most likely to report that
there are insurance restrictions on obtaining medication and treatment

N2  - Background: Optimizing participant response rates is important for
obtaining representative samples and the timely completion of studies.
It is a common practice to use participant incentives to boost response
rates, but few studies have systematically examined their effectiveness,
particularly among minority groups.
Methods: We experimentally tested three incentive strategies for their
effectiveness in improving response rates among colorectal cancer cases
(n = 3,816) and their relatives (n = 2,353). A 2 x 2 x 2 factorial
design compared (a) registered versus first class mail, (b) $5 cash
with the initial mailing (yes/no), and (c) $20 promise (yes/no) upon
completion of the information form (for cases) or $10 promise (yes/no)
upon completion of the baseline survey (for relatives). Outcome measures
were provision of contact information on first-degree relatives for
cases and completion of the baseline survey for relatives.
Results: The response rate among cases was low in all ethnic groups
(28-37%) and incentive strategies did not have an effect. Among
relatives, the overall baseline survey response rate was 71%, ranging
from 66% among Asians to 76% among Whites. Modest absolute increases
were observed for payment schedules that included a $5 cash enclosure
with the initial mailing in the total sample {[}odds ratio (OR), 1.65
and 1.47] and among Latinos (OR, 1.94 and 1.74) but not among Asians
(OR, 1.61 and 1.55) or African Americans (OR, 1.19 and 1.02). Response
rates were not influenced by registered versus first-class mailing.
Conclusion: The effects of incentives in this study were modest with
some suggestion of differences by ethnic group and type of incentive.

N2  - Background:
Nationally health systems are making increasing investments in the use
of clinical information systems. Little is known about current computer
use by specialist physicians, particularly outside the hospital setting.
Aims:
To identify the extent and reasons physician Fellows of the Royal
Australasian College of Physicians (RACP) use computers in their work.
Methods:
A self-administered survey was emailed from the RACP to all practising
physicians in 2007 that were living in Australia and New Zealand who had
consented to email contact with the College.
Results:
The survey was sent to a total of 7445 eligible physicians, 2328
physicians responded (31.3% response rate), but only 1266 responses
(21.0%) were able to be analysed. Most 97.5% had access to computers
at work and 96.5% used home computers for work purposes. Physicians in
public hospitals (72.6%) were more likely to use computers for work
(65.6%) than those in private hospitals (12.6%) or consulting rooms
(27.3%). Overall physicians working in public hospitals used a wider
range of applications with 70.5% using their computers for searching
the internet, 53.7% for receiving results and 52.7% used their
computers to engage in specific educational activities. Physicians
working from their consulting rooms (33.6%) were more likely to use
electronic prescribing (11%) compared with physicians working in public
hospitals (5.7%).
Conclusions:
Fellows have not incorporated computers into their consulting rooms over
which they have control. This is in contrast to general practitioners
who have embraced computers after the provision of various incentives.
The rate of use of computers by physicians for electronic prescribing in
consulting rooms (11%) is very low in comparison with general
practitioners (98%). One reason may be that physicians work in multiple
locations whereas general practitioners are more likely to work from one
location.

N2  - Objective To assess the robustness of patient responses to a new
national survey of patient experience as a basis for providing financial
incentives to doctors.
Design Analysis of the representativeness of the respondents to the GP
Patient Survey compared with those who were sampled (5.5 million
patients registered with 8273 general practices in England in January
2009) and with the general population. Analysis of non-response bias
looked at the relation between practice response rates and scores on the
survey. Analysis of the reliability of the survey estimated the
proportion of the variance of practice scores attributable to true
differences between practices.
Results The overall response rate was 38.2% (2.2 million responses),
which is comparable to that in surveys using similar methodology in the
UK. Men, young adults, and people living in deprived areas were
under-represented among respondents. However, for questions related to
pay for performance, there was no systematic association between
response rates and questionnaire scores. Two questions which triggered
payments to general practitioners were reliable measures of practice
performance, with average practice-level reliability coefficients of
93.2% and 95.0%. Less than 3% and 0.5% of practices had fewer than
the number of responses required to achieve conventional reliability
levels of 90% and 70%. A change to the payment formula in 2009
resulted in an increase in the average impact of random variation in
patient scores on payments to general practitioners compared with
payments made in 2007 and 2008.
Conclusions There is little evidence to support the concern of some
general practitioners that low response rates and selective non-response
bias have led to systematic unfairness in payments attached to
questionnaire scores. The study raises issues relating to the validity
and reliability of payments based on patient surveys and provides
lessons for the UK and for other countries considering the use of
patient experience as part of pay for performance schemes.

N2  - Surveys can be a useful tool for mental health services research.
Unfortunately, clinicians typically show low response rates to surveys.
To determine whether noncontingent incentives would increase responses
among clinicians, we compared no incentive versus four incentives (mood
magnet, $1, $2, $5) on response to a 7-page self-report survey of
mental health assessment and treatment practices in a sample of 500
clinicians from the 5 largest professional guilds. Noncontingent
monetary incentives significantly increased response rate compared to no
incentive across all disciplines. Noncontingent monetary incentives are
discussed as a cost-effective method for increasing survey response rate
among mental health clinicians.

N2  - Objectives. We sought to identify the incentives most likely to
encourage voluntary participation in the national public health
accreditation model.
Methods. We reviewed existing incentives, held meetings with key
informants, and conducted a survey of state and local public health
agency representatives. The survey was sent to all state health
departments and a sample of local health departments. Group-specific
differences in survey responses were examined.
Results. Survey response rates were 51% among state health department
representatives and 49% among local health department representatives.
Both state health department and local health department respondents
rated financial incentives for accredited agencies, financial incentives
for agencies considering accreditation, and infrastructure and quality
improvement as important incentives. State health department respondents
also indicated that grant administration and grant application would
encourage their participation in the national accreditation model, and
local health department respondents also noted that technical assistance
and training would encourage their participation.
Conclusions. Incentives to encourage participation of state and local
agencies in the national voluntary accreditation model should include
financial support as well as support for agency infrastructure and
quality improvements. Several initiatives are already under way to
support agency infrastructure and quality improvement, but financial
support incentives have yet to be developed. (Am J Public Health.

strategies to increase organ donation. The majority of the membership
supports reimbursement for funeral expenses, an income tax credit on the
final return of a deceased donor and an income tax credit for
registering as an organ donor as strategies for increasing deceased
donation. Payment for lost wages, guaranteed health insurance and an
income tax credit are strategies most strongly supported by the
membership to increase living donation. For both deceased and living
donation, the membership is mostly opposed to cash payments to donors,
their estates or to next-of-kin. There is strong support for a
government-regulated trial to evaluate the potential benefits and harms
of financial incentives for both deceased and living donation. Overall,
there is strong support within the ASTS membership for changes to NOTA
that would permit the implementation and careful evaluation of indirect,

N2  - Introduction and Aims. As medical practitioners of the future, medical
students should be taught about tobacco control strategies and smoking
cessation interventions. By including education about tobacco in the
medical curricula, they can be informed about the health effects of
tobacco use and learn to assist smokers to quit. Our study aimed to
estimate the extent of teaching about tobacco and smoking cessation
techniques in medical schools worldwide and compare with results we
reported 10 years ago, to determine the content of curricula and range
of teaching formats and to identify barriers to teaching about tobacco
in medical schools and solutions. Design and Methods. A cross-sectional
survey of all existing medical schools (n = 2090) in 171 countries was
conducted. A questionnaire was designed, translated and sent to all
medical schools. Main outcome measures included whether and how tobacco
is taught; comparisons with the survey conducted 10 years ago; tobacco
content in the curriculum; format of teaching; and barriers to teaching
and solutions. Results. 665 medical schools from 109 countries completed
the full questionnaire, with a response rate of 31.8% from medical
schools and 64% of countries and consisting of 39% of medical schools
in developed and 28% in less developed countries. A further 67 medical
schools responded to a single question on whether they taught about
tobacco. The total response rate was 35%. Of 561 medical schools
responding to questions on teaching options, 27% of medical schools
taught a specific module on tobacco compared with only 11% in our
survey of medical schools conducted a decade ago; 77% integrated
teaching on tobacco with other topics compared with 40% 10 years ago;
31% taught about tobacco informally as the topic arose (vs. 58%) and
4% did not teach about tobacco (vs. 12%). Most common topics taught
were: health effects of smoking (94%), health effects of passive
smoking (84.5%), epidemiology of tobacco use (81%), nicotine
dependence (78%) and taking a smoking history (75%). Most popular
method of teaching was by lectures (78%), case study discussions and
problem-based learning exercises (51%), class readings 46%, in the
clinical setting with real patients (45%), special projects and
assignments (45%) and patient-centred teaching approaches, such as role
plays (31%). Significantly, more barriers to teaching were identified
by less developed countries (> 60%) including: lack of available
teaching time in the medical program, limited organisational ability to
include new subjects, lack of staff resources to teach, lack of current
plans to introduce a tobacco curriculum, lack of a key person to
champion and organise teaching, lack of financial resources and lack of
incentives or advantages to teach. A majority described solutions to
these problems. A case study of education on tobacco throughout the
medical curriculum is presented. Discussion and Conclusions. We found an
encouraging increase in the extent of teaching on tobacco in medical
schools over 10 years. We report that although progress has been made to
address the teaching of tobacco in medical schools worldwide, there is a
great deal more effort required so that education on tobacco is an
ongoing part of medical curricula. The teaching content is generally
based on evidence-based smoking cessation guidelines. {[}Richmond R,

N2  - Over the last decade the library and information science (LIS) field has
experienced an increasing concern with workforce issues, including the
aging of the workforce, the lack of minority presence in the field, and
the need for succession planning. Little systematic research has been
done to characterize the exact nature of the problems and to develop
data collection models that can be used to track the workforce on an
ongoing basis. The Workforce Issues in Library and Information Science 1
(WILIS 1) project is a three-year research project designed to study the
career patterns of graduates of library and information science (LIS)
programs in North Carolina. The purpose of this paper is to describe the
study design and methodology of the career retrospective study fielded
by the WILIS study and to discuss the methodological lessons learned
from this experience. The WILIS 1 career retrospective survey was
fielded as a Web-based survey with complex skip patterns and achieved a
35 percent response rate. Topics for which lessons were learned include:
the identification of effective strategies for updating graduate contact
records, the relative efficacy of paper versus e-mail contacts in the
survey recruitment process, the contributions of a nonresponse study to
issues of generalizability, issues related to survey length, and the use
of incentives.

N2  - This study revisits the issue of monetary incentive effects utilizing
data from a mail survey sent to a random sample of adults across the
United States regarding preferences for fuel ethanol. The results
reported here are consistent with those found in the literature
regarding the effect of incentives on response rates: they improved
them, with prepaid incentives performing relatively better. We also
found that state of residence was significantly correlated with choosing
whether to respond to a survey. Regarding the effect of incentives on
sample composition, we found that incentives tended to bias the sample
in favor of less educated respondents, and tended to attract respondents
less familiar with the survey subject. Finally, results indicate that
incentives had very little effect on item nonresponse. Instead, item
nonresponse was driven by education level, gender, and familiarity with
the survey subject. However, combining the findings on sample
composition with those of item nonresponse, it appears that the use of
incentives indirectly affects item nonresponse by recruiting relatively
more respondents that are less educated and/or less familiar with the
survey topic, who are then less likely to respond to all questions.

N2  - Marine recreational surveys that use lists of coastal households for a
sampling frame have been encouraged to improve their efficiency by using
angler license registries instead. However. few studies have compared
surveys of license holders and coastal households or assessed the gain
in efficiency. During a survey of the recreational fishery for the blue
crab Callinectes sapidus in Maryland, spoil crab license holder and
coastal county households were sampled by telephone. Overall, 40.5% of
license holder households interviewed reported activity compared with
2.7% of coastal households interviewed. The license list showed no
disadvantage in statistical properties compared with coastal households.
However, the response rate was low for both lists for the license
Survey, 30.5% of telephone numbers called resulted in interviews
compared with 29.3% for coastal households. To improve response rates,
we recommend that license registries incorporate incentives and
alternative information for reaching license holders. such as cell-phone
numbers and e-mail addresses.

N2  - Background: Self-assessment of symptoms by patients with chronic
conditions is an important element of disease management. A recent study
in a commercially-insured population found that patients who received
automated telephone calls for asthma self-assessment felt they
benefitted from the calls. Few studies have evaluated the effectiveness
of disease self-assessment in Medicaid populations. The goals of this
study were to: (1) assess the feasibility of asthma self-assessment in a
population predominantly insured by Medicaid, (2) study whether adding a
gift card incentive increased completion of the self-assessment survey,
and (3) evaluate how the self-assessment affected processes and outcomes
of care.
Methods: We studied adults and children aged 4 years and older who were
insured by a Medicaid-focused managed care organization (MCO) in a pre-
and post-intervention study. During the pre- incentive period, patients
with computerized utilization data that met specific criteria for
problematic asthma control were mailed the Asthma Control Test (ACT), a
self-assessment survey, and asked to return it to the MCO. During the
intervention period, patients were offered a $20 gift card for
returning the completed ACT to the MCO. To evaluate clinical outcomes,
we used computerized claims data to assess the number of hospitalization
visits and emergency department visits experienced in the 3 months after
receiving the ACT. To evaluate whether the self-management intervention
improved processes of care, we conducted telephone interviews with
patients who returned or did not return the ACT by mail.
Results: During the pre- incentive period, 1183 patients were identified
as having problems with asthma control; 25 (2.0%) of these returned the
ACT to the MCO. In contrast, during the incentive period, 1612 patients
were identified as having problems with asthma control and 87 (5.4%) of
these returned the ACT to the MCO (p<0.0001). Of all 95 ACTs that were
returned, 87% had a score of 19 or less, which suggested poor asthma
control.
During the 3 months after they received the ACT, patients who completed
it had similar numbers of outpatient visits, emergency department
visits, and hospitalizations for asthma as patients who did not complete
the ACT. We completed interviews with 95 patients, including 28 who had
completed the ACT and 67 who had not. Based on an ACT administered at
the time of the interview, patients who had previously returned the ACT
to the MCO had asthma control similar to those who had not (mean scores
of 14.2 vs. 14.6, p=0.70). Patients had similar rates of contacting
their providers within the past 2 months whether they had completed the
mailed ACT or not (71% vs. 76%, p=0.57).
Conclusion: Mailing asthma self-assessment surveys to patients with
poorly controlled asthma was not associated with better
asthma-associated outcomes or processes of care in the Medicaid
population studied. Adding a gift card incentive did not meaningfully
increase response rates. Asthma disease management programs for Medicaid
populations will most likely need to involve alternative strategies for
engaging patients and their providers in managing their conditions.

N2  - The ethanol industry is growing in response to increased consumer
demands for fuel as well as the renewable fuel standard. Corn ethanol
processing creates the following products: 1/3 ethanol, 1/3 distillers
grains, and 1/3 carbon dioxide. As the production of ethanol increases
so does the generation of its coproducts, and viable uses continually
need to be developed. A survey was mailed to operational US ethanol
plants to determine current practices. It inquired about processes,
equipment used, end products, and desired future directions for
coproducts. Results indicated that approximately one-third of plant
managers surveyed expressed a willingness to alter current drying time
and temperature if it could result in a higher quality coproduct. Other
managers indicated hesitation. based on lack of economic incentives,
potential cost and return, and capital required. Respondents also
reported the desire to use their coproducts in some of the following
products: fuels, extrusion, pellets, plastics, and human food
applications. These results provide a snapshot of the industry, and
indicate that operational changes to the current production of DDGS must
be based upon the potential for positive economic returns. Published by

N2  - To understand one of the predominant groups supporting people with
disabilities and illness, this study examined the profile of New Zealand
paid caregivers, including their training needs.
Paid caregivers, also known as healthcare assistants, caregivers and
home health aides, work across several long-term care settings, such as
residential homes, continuing-care hospitals and also private homes.
Their roles include assisting with personal care and household
management. New Zealand, similar to other countries, is facing a health
workforce shortage.
A three-phased design was used: phase I, a survey of all home-based and
residential care providers (N = 942, response rate = 45%); phase II, a
targeted survey of training needs (n = 107, response = 100%); phase
III, four focus groups and 14 interviews with 36 providers, exploring
themes arising from phases I and II.
Findings on 17 910 paid caregivers revealed a workforce predominantly
female (94%), aged between 40 and 50, with 6% over the age of 60. Mean
hourly pay NZ$10.90 (minimum wage NZ$10.00 approx. UK3.00 at time of
study) and 24 hours per week. The national paid caregiver turnover was
29% residential care and 39% community. Most providers recognised the
importance of training, but felt their paid caregivers were not
adequately trained. Training was poorly attended; reasons cited were
funding, family, secondary employment, staff turnover, low pay and few
incentives.
The paid caregiver profile described reflects trends also observed in
other countries. There is a clear policy direction in New Zealand and
other countries to support people with a disability at home, and yet the
workforce which is facilitating this vision is itself highly vulnerable.
Paid caregivers have minimum pay, are female, work part-time and
although it is recognised that training is important for them, they do
not attend, so consequently remain untrained.

N2  - The empirical literature that explores whether physicians respond to
financial incentives has not definitively answered the question of
whether physicians alter their treatment behavior at the margin.
Previous research has not been able to distinguish that part of a
physician response that uniformly alters treatment of all patients under
a physician's care from that which affects some, but not all of a
physician's patients. To explore physicians' marginal responses to
financial incentives while accounting for the selection of physicians
into different financial arrangements where others could not, I use data
from a survey of physician visits to isolate the effect that capitation,
a form of reimbursement wherein physicians receive zero marginal revenue
for a range of physician provided services, has on the care provided by
a physician. Fixed effects regression results reveal that physicians
spend less time with their capitated patients than with their
non-capitated patients. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - The welfare state faces a number of challenges. Recent reforms in the UK
appear broadly successful in attaining targets and improving
cost-efficiency, but are nonetheless confronted by public disquiet and
unease. This article argues that one difficulty with the new directions
in policy is that they rest on a particular and limited understanding of
agency. Reformers tend to operate within a theoretical framework that
understands behaviour as driven by individual and predominantly rational
incentives and pays little attention to the expressive and normative
aspects of social action. The problems that arise in these areas when a
competitive market logic is applied in social provision tend not to be
recognised. Such it logic may contradict established values of social
care and commitment to user interests. A qualitative survey Of 48
members of the general public is used to examine perceptions of and
responses to the NHS reforms, and to show how public discourse in this
area is at variance with the instrumental and individual assumptions of
policy-makers. The result is that the reform programme damages the
legitimacy of the service and that those responsible for the new
policies fail to recognise that the individual instrumental agenda is
eroding public trust.

N2  - This paper explores how the elimination of Madagascar's Vanilla
Marketing Board (VMB) in 1993 affected prices paid to farmers,
incentives and indicators of poverty and inequality using household
survey data and simulation analysis. Following the reforms, margins
between FOB and farmgate prices have narrowed down, and the analysis of
changes in poverty and inequality based on household surveys suggests a
reduction in poverty and a muted supply response. A counterfactual
analysis based on the observed reduction in intermediation margins shows
that, however limited, increase in competition among intermediaries has
contributed to raise purchase prices and the cash income of vanilla
farmers. After taking into account the reduction in Madagascar's
monopoly power on the world vanilla market implied by the elimination of
the VMB, the induced rise in producer prices is estimated to have lifted
about 20,000 individuals out of poverty.

N2  - Developmental states are criticized for rapid ``industrialization
without enlightenment.'' In the last 30 years, China's breathtaking
growth has been achieved at a high environmental and food safety cost.
This article, utilizing a recent survey of China's livestock industry,
illustrates the initiating role of China's developmental state in the
exponential expansion of the country's livestock production. The
enthusiastic response of the livestock industry to the many state policy
incentives has made China the world's biggest animal farming nation.
Shortage of meat and dairy supply is history. Yet, the Chinese
government is facing new challenges of no less a threat to political
stability. Production intensification has created a welfare crisis
impacting the world's biggest number of farm animals. The resulting food
safety incidents are affecting consumer confidence and health. Untreated
waste contributes to the nation's environmental degradation.
Developmental states may have a proud record of growth in the initial
stage of industrialization. Their prospects for sustained development
have long been questioned. China has come to an important juncture to
march towards a sustained development.

N2  - Randomized response techniques (RRTs) aim to reduce social desirability
bias in the assessment of sensitive attributes but differ regarding
privacy protection. The less protection a design offers, the more likely
respondents cheat by disobeying the instructions. In asymmetric RRT
designs, respondents can play safe by giving a response that is never
associated with the sensitive attribute. Symmetric RRT designs avoid the
incentive to cheat by not allowing such responses. We tested whether a
symmetric variant of a cheating detection model (CDM) increases
compliance with the instructions in a survey of academic dishonesty
among 2,254 Chinese students. As we observed more noncompliance in the
asymmetric than symmetric variant, we recommend the use of symmetric
CDMs, which can easily be tested within multinomial models.

N2  - This study examined the effectiveness of two procedures aimed at
improving response rates for mail surveys: an incentive sent with either
the first mail-out or first follow-up, and the inclusion of a
replacement questionnaire, with or without an incentive, with either the
first or second follow-up. The survey involved a sample of 1,600 New
Zealand residents aged 18 years or older, randomly selected from the
2005 Electoral Roll and randomly assigned to one of four treatment
groups. The response rates after two follow-ups ranged from 62.3 to 66.5
percent. Using a chocolate as an incentive with the first mail-out was
effective in generating a significantly higher initial response than the
control; however, after two follow-up mail-outs, differences were not
significant. Sending a replacement questionnaire plus a chocolate with
the first follow-up generated a significantly higher response rate than
merely sending a letter, and the effect of this procedure persisted
through to the end of the survey. Overall, these results provide further
compelling evidence of the importance of using follow-up mail-outs for
improving mail survey response rates.

N2  - Objective: To gauge the faculty's understanding and perceptions of a
recently implemented academic incentive plan (AIP) to encourage
productivity.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Surveys were administered to faculty
at a university teaching hospital before and after allocation of the
incentive during the inaugural implementation of an AIP.
Main Outcome Measure: Survey Likert scale.
Results: Preallocation and postallocation survey response rates were
64% and 67%, respectively. Although 92% of respondents submitted the
required self-reports of academic activities, only 25% met with their
chiefs to assess productivity. Despite the small incentive, more than
50% believed that the AIP encouraged them to increase academic pursuits
and rewarded activities important to the department that had not
previously been reimbursed. Most did not believe that teaching, clinical
research, or citizenship were adequately compensated before or after AIP
implementation. However, more thought that citizenship (P=.02) and
administration (P=.001) were adequately compensated in the
postallocation vs preallocation survey; there were similar trends for
clinical research (P=.17) and teaching (P=.06). Among 25 respondents who
provided additional comments, 52% mentioned a lack of transparency in
the method of incentive distribution as a concern.
Conclusions: Although only a few met with their chiefs for assessment,
most faculty believed that even a minimal financial incentive might
encourage them to increase their academic activities. We are encouraged
to continue the AIP as a positive motivator for academic pursuits, and
we plan additional measures to make incentive allocation more
transparent.

N2  - Despite acute staffing shortages in social work, workforce planning
within the UK social care sector is compromised by poor workforce
intelligence. This study aimed to inform the evidence base providing new
data on recruitment and retention in Wales, examining what personal and
organizational characteristics are associated with intentions to leave,
and what initiatives or incentives might mediate that effect. A
multi-method design facilitated comparisons between two data sources - a
census of all 22 Welsh local authority employers about recruitment and
retention practices and a survey of all social workers and senior
practitioners employed in social services (n = 998; response rate
45.9%) about demography, workforce characteristics, working patterns,
morale and plans and reasons for leaving one's job. Vacancy (mean
14.4%) and turnover (mean 15%) rates were statistically significantly
higher in children's services than in adult services; vacancy rates were
also higher in authorities that offered higher starting salaries. The
provision of certain types of traineeship might also be associated with
higher vacancy rates but these results should be treated with some
caution. There was little evidence that recruitment and retention
initiatives were associated with lower vacancy or turnover rates,
despite employers' perceptions about their effectiveness. Social workers
derived a lot of satisfaction from their work, but more than a quarter
wanted to leave their job within 6 months, and almost as many were
actively seeking alternative employment. Intention to leave was
explained by job and employer satisfaction, and negative feelings about
pay. Senior practitioners and staff members with longer lengths of
service were less likely to want to leave, even if they were
dissatisfied with their job or employer. Job and employer
dissatisfaction was associated with retention initiatives related to
facilities, good caseload management and home-working, suggesting that
dissatisfied staff might remain in employment for longer if these
initiatives were in place.

N2  - We provide an overview of survey design and implementation strategies in
orthopaedic surgery. Health-care surveys are vital for obtaining
information on the beliefs, patterns of practice, attitudes, and
behaviors of orthopaedic surgeons. It is important to obtain a high
response rate from administered surveys to reduce bias due to
nonresponse. Researchers should follow the guidelines provided by this
review to increase the response rate of orthopaedic surgeons to surveys.
When designing these surveys, the researcher must consider length,
format, and aesthetics. In addition, the types of questions that are
included, the wording of these questions, and the order in which the
questions are presented within the survey need to be carefully
considered. Surveys can be administered by telephone, mail, facsimile
(fax), and electronically by e-mail or Internet. The use of a mixed-mode
method is recommended to improve the response rate. To increase the
response rate to surveys that are directed at health professionals, a
number of strategies have been suggested, including using cover letters,
personalizing the cover letter and survey package, pretesting the cover
letter and survey, contacting the surgeons prior to administration of
the survey, contacting the surgeons multiple times, using stamped return
envelopes in mail surveys, using appropriate survey packaging styles,
providing incentives, and ensuring that the orthopaedic surgeon
recognizes the sender of the survey. The costs associated with each
administration method are briefly discussed, and ethical considerations
are reviewed.

N2  - Recent strategies employed in response to military physician recruitment
shortfalls have consisted of increasing financial incentives for
students in the Health Professions Scholarship Program (HPSP) while
offering no increased incentive for attendance at the Uniformed Services
University of the Health Sciences (USUHS). To gauge the impact of these
incentive increases on the decision of medical students to attend USUHS,
a prospective e-mail survey of current USUHS medical students was
conducted. The survey was distributed to 674 USUHS medical students from
all four class years, of which 41% responded. Students were asked to
prioritize incentives and disincentives for military service and USUHS,
as well as respond to whether recent incentives applied solely to the
HPSP would have affected their decision to attend USUHS. Data were
assessed using a weighted scale with responses ranked highest receiving
a score of 3, responses ranked second receiving a weighted score of 2,
and those ranked third receiving a weighted score of I. The total
weighted sum for each question response across the respondent population
was then tallied in aggregate and assigned a weighted score to identify
factors consistently ranked highest among the students. Patriotic duty
and serving uniformed personnel were ranked most appealing about
military service. Combat and deployment considerations were ranked least
appealing about military service. Also of note, numerous survey comment
box responses highlighted the perceived advantages of pooling resources
between the two programs to benefit military medical student recruitment
and training. Survey results suggested that current enhanced financial
incentives and shorter service obligation offered by the HPSP make
attendance of USUHS less appealing for current USUHS students and may
negatively impact recruitment and retention of USUHS medical officers.
Commensurate incentives such as promotion and credit for time in service
while attending USUHS were identified by current USUHS medical students
as a possible means of improving USUHS appeal.

interactions (medical groups. 33.9%; IPAs, 9.5%), electronic drug
prescribing (medical groups. 41.9%: IPAs, 25.1%), and physician use of
e-mail with patients (medical groups, 34.2%; IPAs, 29.1%). Adoption of
CIT was stronger for physician organizations evaluated by external
entities for pay-for-performance and public reporting purposes (P =

< 0.001).
Discussion: External incentives and participation in quality improvement

N2  - The rapid pace of wind power development in the USA over the lost decade
has outstripped the ability of most project developers to provide
adequate equity capital and to make efficient use of project-related tax
benefits. In response, the sector has created novel project financing
structures that feature varying combinations of equity capital from
project developers and third-party tax-oriented investors and, in some
cases, commercial debt. While their origins stem from variations in the
financial capacity and business objectives of wind project developers,
as well as the risk tolerances and objectives of equity and debt
providers, each structure is, at its core, designed to manage project
risk and to allocate federal tax incentives to those entities that can
use them most efficiently. This paper surveys the six principal
financing structures through which most new utility-scale wind projects
(excluding utility-owned projects) in the USA have been financed from
1999 to the present. These structures include simple balance sheet
finance, several varieties of all-equity special allocation partnership
`flip' structures and two leveraged structures. In addition to
describing each structure's mechanics, the paper also discusses its
rationale for use, the types of investors that find it appealing and
why, and its relative frequency of use in the market. The paper
concludes with a generalized summary of how a developer might choose one
structure over another. Copyright (c) 2008 US Government Work.

METHODS: A multiquestion survey was developed and distributed via the
Association of Program Directors in Surgery list-serve.
RESULTS: There were 80 respondents (31% response rate), 29 university
program (UP), 43 independent program (IP), and 8 ``other.{''} Although
most programs had designated teaching faculty (72% UP, 93% IP), the
trend was not to compensate for scholarly activity whether voluntary
(100% UP, 91% IP), employed (82% UP, 74% IP), or contracted (57%
UP, 85% IP; P = not specified). Most (69% UP, 75% IP) programs had no
incentives for scholarly activities, despite dissatisfaction with
involvement of volunteer faculty (19% UP, 55% IP; P =.04). Most
compensation plans (79% UP, 66% IP) were discretionary or atypical.
CONCLUSIONS: Most programs, UP and IP, did not compensate for scholarly
activity for teaching faculty. There was a significant proportion that
believed compensation would improve teaching efforts. (c) 2009 Published

are estimated to remain in the Indian subcontinent, whilst the
Indochinese breeding population is primarily restricted to grasslands
surrounding the Tonle Sap lake, Cambodia. We conducted the first
comprehensive breeding season survey of Bengal Florican within the Tonle
Sap region (19,500 km(2)). During 2005/06 and 2006/07 we systematically
sampled 1-km squares for territorial males. Bengal Florican were
detected within 90 1-km squares at a mean density of 0-34 males km(-2)
which, accounting for unequal Survey effort across grassland blocks,
provides a mean estimate of 0.2 males km(-2). Based on 2005 habitat
extent, the estimated Tonle Sap population is 416 adult males (333-502
+/- 95% CI), more than half of them in Kompong Thorn province. Tonle
Sap grasslands are rapidly being lost due to intensification of rice
cultivation and, based on satellite images, we document declines of 28%
grassland cover within 10 grassland blocks between January 2005 and
March 2007. Based on Mean 2005 population densities the remaining
grassland may support as few as 294 adult male florican, a decline of
30% since 2005. In response to these habitat declines almost 350 km(2)
of grassland have been designated as protected areas, set aside for
biodiversity and local livelihoods. Conservation activities in these
areas include participatory land-Use zoning, patrols reporting new
developments to government officials, awareness-raising and
incentive-led nest protection schemes.

N2  - The European Computer Driving Licence (ECDL) has been adopted as the
reference standard for all NHS staff for basic IT skills. The objective
of the study was to determine awareness of the ECDL amongst members of
the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. An anonymous
postal survey was conducted with members and fellows of the College in
three UK regions. A total of 720 questionnaires were posted, and the
response rate was 47.9 per cent. A fifth of all respondents were not
aware of the ECDL at all, and only 10 per cent were trained in the ECDL.
However, more than third had some other formal training in IT skills.
Half the respondents suggested that the questionnaire had prompted them
to train for the ECDL. Much needs to be done to increase awareness of
the ECDL and offer incentives for its takeup.

N2  - Introduction : Previous impact tool-kits for UK health libraries
required updating to reflect recent evidence and changes in library
services. The National Knowledge Service funded development of updated
guidance.
Methods : Survey tools were developed based on previous impact studies
and a systematic review. The resulting draft questionnaire survey was
tested at four sites, and the interview schedule was investigated in a
fifth area. A literature search in ASSIA, Google Scholar, INTUTE, LISA,
LISTA, SCIRUS, Social Sciences Citation Index ( Web of Knowledge), and
the major UK University and National Libraries Catalogue (COPAC),
identified ways to improve response rates. Other expert advice
contributed to the guidance.
Results : The resulting guidance contains evidence-based advice and a
planning pathway for conducting an impact survey as a service audit. The
survey tools ( critical incident questionnaire and interview schedule)
are available online. The evidence-based advice recommends personalizing
the request, assuring confidentiality, and using follow-up reminders.
Questionnaires should be brief, and small incentives, such as a lottery
draw should be considered. Bias is minimized if the survey is conducted
and analysed by independent researchers.
Conclusion : The guidance is a starting point for a pragmatic survey to
assess the impact of health library services.

N2  - Study Objective: To characterize the approach of academic chairs of
anesthesiology in leading and managing their departments, and to gain
insights into what they considered the most difficult challenges as
chairs.
Design: Internet-based survey instrument conducted during July and
August of 2006.
Setting: Academic medical center.
Measurements: Department chairs of 132 academic anesthesiology programs
who were listed on the Society of Academic Anesthesiology Chairs
Listserv, were surveyed. The overall number of respondents were
reported. However, as all questions were voluntary, not all were
answered by each respondent. Observations are therefore reported as
absolute numbers and percentages on a question-by-question basis.
Respondents were asked to rank responses to some questions in order of
importance (eg, 1 = most important). These data are presented as rank
ordered median values, determined by the Kruskal-Wallis Test.
Significant differences between groups were determined by Dunn's post
test. A P-value < 0.05 was regarded as significant throughout.
Main Results: The overall response rate was 55%. Chairs spent 36% of
their time in leading, managing, and administration. They ranked
Visionary and Coaching styles of leadership as most important.
Seventy-nine percent had developed ``Vision{''} statements for the
department and 64% of respondents had set goals for divisions. To
communicate within departments, 74% of Chairs had at least monthly
faculty meetings and 50% held at least yearly faculty retreats. Chairs
preferred communicating contentious issues face to face. Ninety-five
percent of Chairs held at least yearly performance appraisals and 85%
had an established incentive system in the department. Academic
productivity (73%) and clinical time (68%) were the most common
components of the incentive system. In 65% of departments, Chairs
delegated the program directorship and in 73%, the running of the
National Residency Matching Program. The financial state of the
department was shared at least annually in 93% of departments. In most
departments (77%), faculty salary ranges were known but individual
faculty salaries were not shared.
Conclusions: Chairs considered the most important leadership challenge
to be setting direction, for the department, and the most difficult
management challenges as ``fostering research and scholarship{''} and
``maintaining revenue to support faculty{''}. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All

N2  - Objective: To develop and test methodology to measure employees
attitudes regarding worksite health promotion. These values and
attitudes are described as a ``culture of health{''} and are believed to
motivate behavior changes toward, improved health outcomes. This survey
tool, was designed to determine the value and degree of support that
employees have,for health improvement initiatives at a large food
company. Methods: The ``Total You Health Values Survey{''} administered
by an outside vendor (Sirota) was sent by e-mail to 4674 headquarters
and research and, development employees with an explanation of the
survey and instructions for completion. The surrey was open 14 days and
there were no incentives,for completion. The survey consisted of three
demographic questions, one open, ended comment section and 14 core
questions in three categories: Supportive Environment, Healthy Lifestyle
Attitudes, and Knowledge and Behavior. Employees were guaranteed
confidentiality and anonymity. Results: There were 3339 responses, a
71% response rate. Ninety-one percent of respondents said that
encouraging healthy lifestyles is a General Mills priority and 97% said
they know the steps needed to stay healthy. Conclusion: We were able to
develop and implement a simple measurement tool to measure the success
of our health promotion activities using an e-mail, based questionnaire.
In the employee population surveyed, we found that there was broad
support for health promotion. We believe that this simple survey tool
can be used by other employers to measure their organizational ``culture
of health.{''} (J Occup Environ Med. 2009;51:351-355)

N2  - Objective: To integrate the resources from a local statewide managed
care organization (MCO) and a supermarket pharmacy chain to conduct a
comprehensive health risk appraisal (HRA). Collected data were used to
assess cardiovascular risk factors and identify disease management
opportunities.
Methods: An analysis to determine the prevalence of risk factors was
conducted on a cross-sectional HRA survey. The HRA involved
point-of-care cholesterol screening (with a follow-up risk factor
questionnaire) conducted by pharmacist employees of the employer group
(a regional supermarket chain). Those eligible for the screening were
employees of the supermarket chain and their dependents covered by the
participating MCO.
Results: A total of 12,915 completed HRA questionnaires were received.
The mean age of the employees participating was approximately 44 years.
Of note, 14%, 24%, 21%, and 69% of questionnaires had abnormal
values for total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
cholesterol, blood pressure, and body mass index (BMI), respectively.
Compared with national benchmarks, low HDL cholesterol and BMI more than
30 kg/m(2) were more common in this cohort. More than one-fourth of the
employees in this analysis were identified as being at high risk for a
coronary heart disease event.
Conclusion: The unique collaboration presented here allowed for an
expanded role of pharmacists to implement a quality improvement program.
In response, the employer decided to continue the HRA screening and
offer a employee contribution reduction-based health incentive to
covered members. The employer also is considering offering
cardiovascular disease management interventions that will be performed
by the supermarket chain's pharmacists and targeted toward the
identified risk factor trends.

N2  - Health tests are often seen as promising donor incentives to improve the
supply of blood. However, systematic behavioral evidence on donor
recruitment is scarce.
To study the effectiveness of a free cholesterol test in attracting new
donors and motivating previous donors, two field experiments were
conducted. In Study 1, 2825 nondonors were randomly assigned to one of
three treatments: a solicitation letter, a solicitation letter plus an
appeal, or a solicitation letter plus an appeal and the offer of a free
cholesterol test. In Study 2, 8269 previous donors were randomly
assigned to one of three treatments: a standard invitation, an
invitation plus an appeal, or an invitation plus an appeal and a
cholesterol test. Marginal effects from probit estimations were
calculated to study the effects of the treatments on donors' response.
In Study 1, only 0.6 percent reacted to the solicitation letter. There
were no significant differences in the response rates between the three
treatments. In Study 2, 45.3 percent of the invited previous donors came
to donate. The appeal (marginal effect, -0.5%; standard error {[}SE],
1.9%) and offering a cholesterol test (marginal effect, 1.6%; SE,
1.8%) did not significantly increase the probability of a donation
relative to the standard invitation. The treatment effects for the
cholesterol test did not systematically differ between frequent and
infrequent donors and female and male donors. There is some evidence
that young donors responded relatively most positive to the cholesterol
test (marginal effect, 4.4%; SE, 2.2%).
Contrary to conclusions from survey studies, free cholesterol testing
did not significantly increase donations from nondonors and previous
donors during a 3-month campaign. The two studies show that field
experiments are an important method to evaluate donation incentives,
because measuring donors' intentions alone can lead to significantly
different conclusions.

N2  - Society's expectations of farmers in relation to their environmental
performance are ever increasing, in general terms and in response to
regional challenges. One tool for achieving environmental improvements
in agriculture is the design and promotion of region-specific `best
management practices' (BMPs). BMPs are conservation practices aimed at
reducing diffuse source pollution from agricultural lands and thus
improving end-of-catchment water quality, A suite of grazing BMPs was
developed for the Burdekin River catchment in Australia, which drains
into the Great Barrier Reef lagoon. BMPs were developed in a
consultative fashion but without explicit consideration of key factors
that influence adoption, in particular farmers' goals and risk
perceptions. This paper utilises the data from a survey of 94 graziers
in the Burdekin River catchment to explore whether and to what extent
motivations and risk perceptions influence the adoption of BMPs. The
results demonstrate clear correlations between both motivations, and
risk attitudes, and the adoption of BMPs. In particular, strong
conservation and lifestyle motivation translates into intrinsic
motivation for adoption of conservation practices. while option values
prevent strongly economically/financially motivated farmers from
adopting in the absence of external incentives. We conclude that a sound
understanding of farmers' motivations and risk attitudes is required-in
a regional, industry and environmental context-to tailor public
investments aimed at providing relevant improvements in the
environmental performance of agriculture. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All

N2  - This paper outlines ways to maximize response rates to surveys by
summarizing the most relevant literature to date and demonstrating how
these techniques have resulted in consistently high rates of return in
family practice research. We describe the methodology used in recent
surveys of physicians conducted by the Centre for Studies in Family
Medicine through its Thames Valley Family Practice Research Unit,
located in London, Ontario, Canada and funded by the Ontario Ministry of
Health and Long-Term Care. The identification and implementation of
these techniques to maximize response rates is critical, as primary
health care researchers often rely on information gathered through
questionnaires to study physicians' practice profiles, experiences and
attitudes. Four separate and distinct mailed surveys of physicians using
a modified Dillman approach were conducted from 2001 to 2004. The
sampling strategies, topics, types of questions and response formats of
these surveys varied. The first survey did not use any incentives or
recorded delivery/registered mail and received a response rate of 48%.
In sharp contrast, the other three surveys obtained responses rates of
76%, 74%, 74%, respectively, achieved through the use of gift
certificates and recorded delivery/registered mail. Sending a survey by
recorded delivery/registered mail tends to result in the survey package
being given priority in the physicians' incoming mail at the practice.
Gift certificates partially compensate physicians for time spent
completing the survey and recognition of the time required is
appreciated. The response rates achieved provide strong evidence to
support the use of monetary incentives and recorded delivery/registered
mail (along with the Dillman approach) in survey research. It is
anticipated that this evidence will be used by other researchers to
justify requests for funding to cover the costs associated with
incentives and recorded delivery/registered mail. We recommend the use
of these strategies to maximize response rates and improve the quality
of this type of primary health care research.

Feasibility was assessed in terms of response rates and generalizability

and the rest did not receive the incentive. There were no other
differences between the other Procedures used. The response rate for the

N2  - A variety of preclinical models have been constructed to emphasize
unique aspects of addiction-like behavior. These include Negative
Reinforcement (Pain Avoidance), Positive Reinforcement (Pleasure
Seeking), Incentive Salience (Craving), Stimulus Response Learning
(Habits), and Inhibitory Control Dysfunction (Impulsivity). We used a
survey to better understand why methamphetamine-dependent research
volunteers (N = 73) continue to use methamphetamine, or relapse to
methamphetamine use after a period of cessation of use. All participants
met DSM-IV criteria for methamphetamine abuse or dependence, and did not
meet criteria for other current Axis I psychiatric disorders or
dependence on other drugs of abuse, other than nicotine. The
questionnaire consisted of a series of face-valid questions regarding
drug use, which in this case referred to methamphetamine use. Examples
of questions include: Do you use drugs mostly to make bad feelings like
boredom, loneliness, or apathy go away?, Do you use drugs mostly because
you want to get high?, Do you use drugs mostly because of cravings?, Do
you find yourself getting ready to take drugs without thinking about
it?, and Do you impulsively take drugs?. The scale was anchored at 1
(not at all) and 7 (very much). For each question, the numbers of
participants rating each question negatively (1 or 2), neither
negatively or affirmatively (3-5), and affirmatively (6 or 7) were
tabulated. The greatest number of respondents (56%) affirmed that they
used drugs due to pleasure seeking. The next highest categories selected
were impulsivity (27%) and habits(25%). Surprisingly, many
participants reported that pain avoidance (30%) and craving (30%) were
not important for their drug use. Results from this study support the
contention that methamphetamine users (and probably other drug users as
well) are more heterogeneous than is often appreciated, and imply that
treatment development might be more successful if treatments targeted
subtypes of patients, though a range of limitations to the approach used
are acknowledged.

N2  - Why do some local governments perform well, while others perform badly?
The rapid shift from centralised-authoritarian to
decentralised-democratic rule in Indonesia has been accompanied by a
large variation in sub-national government policies across districts.
Based on eight district case studies comprising 1,000 business surveys
and 120 in-depth interviews, this paper argues that demand-side
pressures from local firms, associations and district councils are less
significant than supply-side pressures from local government leaders in
explaining variations in taxation, licensing and corruption practices.
In Indonesia's early transition to democratic decentralisation, societal
pressures have been constrained by collective action problems and
perverse political incentives. Local government leaders, on the other
hand, have strong powers and new incentives for policy reform. In
response to the good governance debate, this study's findings suggest
that government leadership is an important, often under-estimated,
policy determinant that can compensate for (or aggravate) weak societal
checks in transitioning economies.

N2  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to determine how employees in
different generational groups (or cohorts) and different career stages
perceive their psychological contracts.
Design/methodology/approach - A survey of 345 working adults included
psychological contract obligations, incentives and importance and the
cognitive responses of job satisfaction, affective commitment and
intention to leave. Super's ``Adult career concerns inventory{''}
measured career stage.
Findings - Small but significant differences between individuals'
psychological contract perceptions were based on both career stage and
generational cohort: higher levels of balanced obligations and
fulfilment were found than either relational or transactional
obligations and fulfilment; relational and transactional obligations
were significantly higher for Baby Boomers than Generation Xers; a
stronger negative relationship was found between transactional
fulfilment and intention to leave for Generation Xers than Generation
Yers; higher balanced fulfilment had a significantly stronger positive
relationship with job satisfaction for exploration compared with other
career stages and commitment for exploration compared with maintenance
stages.
Research limitations/implications - Cross-section methodology and
difference scores in the female-dominated sample limits
generalisability. The study's key theoretical contribution is the need
to further investigate whether the protean career concept is operating
within employees' perceptions of their psychological contractual terms.
Originality/value - Despite widespread colloquial use of generational
cohort groupings such as Baby Boomer, Generation X and Generation Y,
small effect sizes were found. Implications for employers looking to
manage employees' psychological contracts include that there are greater
similarities than differences between the different career stages and
generational cohorts.

N2  - This meta-analysis examined 35 study results within last 10 years that
directly compared the response rates of e-mail versus mail surveys.
Individual studies reported inconsistent findings concerning the
response rate difference between e-mail and mail surveys, but e-mail
surveys generally have lower response rate (about 20% lower on the
average) than mail surveys. Two study features (population type and
follow-up reminders) could account for some variation in the e-mail and
mail survey response rate differences across the studies. For the
studies involving college populations, the response rate difference
between e-mail and mail surveys was much smaller, or even negligible,
suggesting that e-mail survey is reasonably comparable with mail survey
for college populations. The finding about follow-up reminder as a
statistically significant study feature turns out to be somewhat an
anomaly. Other study features (i.e., article type, random assignment of
survey respondents into e-mail and mail survey modes, and use of
incentives) did not prove to be statistically useful in accounting for
the variation of response rate differences between mail and e-mail
surveys. The findings here suggest that, in this age of internet
technology, mail survey is still superior to e-mail survey in terms of
obtaining higher response rate. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

N2  - The cultivation of khat as a high value crop is rapidly expanding in the
East Hararghe Zone of Ethiopia. Khat income currently supports the
livelihood of millions and khat export generates a substantial foreign
exchange earning. This article provides empirical evidence about the
factors driving the process from the perspective of sustainable
livelihood. The analysis is based on a set of data which was generated
through qualitative fieldwork and a household survey. The analysis shows
that the increasing shift by the farmers to khat production as a cash
crop has primarily been triggered by market incentives. However, the
shift reflects not only the price signal, but also that it is a response
to context-specific factors such as demography, agro-climate and
topography. The production of khat as a cash crop has positive income,
food security and poverty effects at household level. Yet, khat is not a
panacea; it is susceptible to frost damage, its market price varies
widely over seasons across the year, and khat cultivation limits
flexibility in resource use. Perhaps the most worrying is the status of
the crop as a controlled substance in some countries against its
dramatic expansion. The policy of hastily `criminalizing' khat
production and trade can have dire consequences on the livelihood of the
poor and the national economy. A long-term development strategy is
required to encourage and support khat-dependent farm households and
others to gradually reduce their reliance on khat through
diversification into other farm and non-farm activities.

and if there is, to identify the responses of the different
stakeholdersgovernment water officials, community leaders and farmers.
In order to achieve this goal, several specific objectives are pursued.
First, the paper evaluates the status of China's groundwater economy,
examining whether or not the groundwater table is systematically
falling. Second, in the parts of China that face a water crisis (or
potential crisis), the paper documents the regulations and policies that
the governmentboth local and regionalhave implemented and discusses
whether they have been successfully implemented. Third, it describes how
farmers have responded to the water crisis and tries to assess whether
or not their roles have helped alleviate the water scarcities or
exacerbated the crisis. To meet these objectives, two large field
surveys are used that cover seven provinces in northern China. The
findings demonstrate that, although the water table is not falling
everywhere in northern China, there are still a substantial number of
communities that appear to be facing a water crisis. When there is a
water crisis, the data show that the government in China has begun to
make a number of policy responses, but the implementation is not always
effective. Where water is becoming scarce, farmers and community leaders
have also responded in numerous ways. However, farmers do not
necessarily respond in ways that effectively save water, mostly because
they do not always have incentives to do so. With good incentives, the
research shows that they do save water. Hence, the government cannot
ignore the way that farmers respond. Indeed, good policy needs to use
this responsiveness to reduce the adverse effects of water scarcities
and encourage conservation.

N2  - In May 2003, the TOPOFF 2 national disaster drill demonstrated
inadequate preparedness for mass casualty terrorist events and failed to
address the willingness of Emergency Department (ED) personnel to assist
with these events. The objective of this study was to examine ED
personnel willingness to respond to various multiple casualty events. A
prospective voluntary survey of ED personnel from multiple hospitals was
randomly administered in the form of vignette-based questionnaires. The
survey of 204 participants at eight hospitals in the Chicago area
revealed that staff members were more willing to work additional hours
for victims of an airplane crash (98.0%), than for a radioactive bomb
(85.3%), or a biologic agent (54.0%). For the biologic agent only, men
were significantly more likely to respond than women. Hospital
management should anticipate significant reductions in workforce during
biologic and radioactive disaster events. Employees' willingness to
respond was not augmented by any incentives offered by hospitals,
although enhanced financial remuneration and disability coverage showed
the most potential to increase response. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - A contingent valuation survey of forest landowners in Southern Vermont
and Western Massachusetts suggests that it would cost about $700 per
acre to entice about one-half of Massachusetts and 33% of Vermont
respondents to permanently conserve their forestland. Policies that
promote early development of management plans and cooperation with
neighbors are recommended because these activities appear to increase
the likelihood that landowners will convey conservation easements.
Education and a strong environmental ethic also improve the chances that
respondents would sell conservation easements. A prediction-based
contingent valuation format designed to reduce incentives for strategic
behavior suggests that our results likely represent a lower bound
estimate of landowner response to a large-scale conservation easement
program. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

N2  - Object. The purpose of this study was to determine a reliable estimate
of the size, demographic, and practice characteristics of the current
pediatric neurosurgical workforce. The authors also sought to
differentiate pediatric from nonpediatric neurosurgical practitioners
and compare the demographic and practice characteristics of these 2
groups. The term ``pediatric practitioner{''} will be used in this study
to describe a practitioner whose practice is > 75% pediatric patients
in accordance with the American Board of Pediatric Neurological Surgery
(ABPNS) requirements for board certification in pediatric neurosurgery.
Those practitioners with < 75% pediatric patients in their practice
will be designated as ``nonpediatric practitioners.{''}
Methods. The authors aggregated multiple databases of professional
neurosurgical societies in an effort to identify pediatric neurosurgical
practitioners. A 30-question survey was then administered to all
identified practitioners, and responses were collected for 6 months.
Primary analysis of pediatric versus nonpediatric practitioners was
performed. Subgroup analyses of the characteristics of the pediatric
practitioners were also performed to identify the effects of
practitioner age, sex, and practice setting on survey responses.
Results. A total of 342 practitioners received the survey, and 267
responded (78.1% response rate); 158 pediatric practitioners and 92
nonpediatric practitioners were identified. Seventeen respondents were
excluded from analysis. Pediatric practitioners were more likely to be
women, ABPNS certified, have completed a pediatric fellowship, do fewer
operative cases per year, have a more frequent call schedule, practice
in a freestanding children's hospital, be in academic practice, and in
need of recruiting additional faculty. Pediatric practitioners spent
fewer hours per week in patient care, and were less likely to have a
productivity-based salary or salary incentive based on relative value
unit-production. Among pediatric practitioners, American Board of
Neurological Surgery and ABPNS certification rates differed
significantly among age groups, with older age groups being more likely
to be certified by the American Board of Neurological Surgery and ABPNS.
The rate of pediatric fellowship completion was significantly higher in
the younger age groups. Anticipating retirement by age 65 was
significantly more likely in the younger age groups, and hours spent per
week spent in teaching and administrative ditties were lower in the
younger age groups. There were 27 female and 131 male pediatric
practitioners. The women were more likely to have completed a pediatric
fellowship and performed fewer operative cases per year than the men.
Nonacademic pediatric practitioners were more likely to have a relative
value unit-based salary incentive, be reimbursed for call coverage, and
spend more hours per week in patient care than academic pediatric
practitioners. Academic pediatric practitioners spent more hours per
week in clinical research.
Conclusions. The authors estimate that there are fewer than 200
pediatric neurosurgeons currently practicing in the United States.
Current practice patterns unique to pediatrics may have important
implications in recruiting and retaining the next generation of
pediatric neurosurgeons. (DOI: 10.3171/2008.10.PEDS08255)

N2  - Objectives: To determine the motivation and incentives in education,
learning experience and teaching techniques, and expectations about
future careers among medical students from a multi-ethnic Asian country.
Methods: Pre-validated questionnaire-based survey with stratified random
sampling among medical students. The questionnaire combined qualitative
responses with semi-quantitative measures of available alternatives.
Results: The response rate was 83.1%. The most important factor for
pursuing university study was `prospect of finding an interesting
challenging job' (rank 1-75%). Family made a significant contribution
in decision making. Given the chance, a majority (67.2%) of respondents
would prefer to study overseas. The main deterring factors were cost
(67.7%), distance from home (28%), and local opportunity for
post-graduation (23.4%). Despite their inclination of study overseas,
the majority (73.9%) of the respondents indicated they were either very
satisfied or satisfied with their current choice of university study.
Only 20% of students were comfortable in asking questions in classroom
as asking questions was deemed `too risky' and `unnecessary to get
better grades'. Students adopted strategies related to assessment and
competition to monitor their study. Senior students reported university
education as less relevant to their future careers as compared to junior
students (p = 0.002).
Conclusions: Students' learning behaviour is determined by complex
factors such as educational incentives, learning support, assessment and
competition. Among several external factors, family, job prospects and
expectations about the future play a critical role in education.

N2  - Background. Faculty development in medical education is gaining momentum
in India. While planning a National Conference on Medical Education
(NCME 2007), we did a survey of principals and faculty of medical
colleges to understand the status of faculty development programmes and
medical education units in medical colleges in India.
Methods. Questionnaires were sent to principals of medical colleges by
surface mail and to faculty through a web-based programme to elicit
information on various aspects of faculty development programmes and
medical education units. The responses of both groups were analysed.
Results. The number of medical education units has increased rapidly
after regulations have been revised in 1997 by the Medical Council of
India. The main activities of medical-education units were to conduct
workshops targeted at medical teachers. The frequently covered topics
were teaching-learning, media and student assessment. Lectures dominated
the methodology of imparting information. Evaluation was done mainly by
feedback questionnaires and pre-test/post-test questionnaires. Projects
and follow/up were rarely used. The responses from both groups were(
strikingly similar. The major strengths of medical education units were
perceived as availability of trained and motivated faculty, good
infrastructure and supportive leadership. The shortcomings were lack of
infrastructure, funding and full-time faculty, besides time constraints
and resistance to change. The respondents suggested strengthening of
infrastructure, appointment of full-time faculty and staff, incentives
and recognition of contributions to faculty development, making
participation a mandatory requirement, extending the scope of faculty
development programmes to include research and networking at the
national level.
Conclusion. The study reveals the need for policy decisions that support
functioning of medical education units in India besides active
participation of the faculty. Natl Med J India 2009;22:28-32

N2  - Aims: Increasing the percentage of rollover protective structure ( ROPS)
equipped tractors has been the focus of many agricultural safety
campaigns. Traditionally efforts have attempted to persuade farmers
through education or community awareness interventions. These efforts
have lead to marginal change. In response, a social marketing approach
was tested as a means for increasing interest in ROPS retrofitting in
New York. Methods: An initial phone survey was conducted with a random
sample of New York farmers to identify a potential target population.
Following target selection, in-depth interviews were conducted to
isolate barriers and motivators to retrofitting. This information was
used to develop message prototypes which were tested in small focus
group discussions. Selected and revised messages, as well as various
other incentives developed in response to feedback from interviews, were
then tested in a prospective, quasi-randomized controlled trial.
Results: Small crop and livestock farms were selected as the
intervention target since they represent 86% of New York farms with
none or only one ROPS protected tractor. Barriers to retrofitting which
were identified in interviews were: 1) constant exposures normalize
risk, 2) risk is modeled by significant others and 3) safety in general
and retrofitting in particular requires too much time and money. The
piloting of ROPS incentives led to a marked increase in ROPS sales in
New York. Conclusions: Social Marketing provides a promising framework
for the design of agricultural injury prevention programs. The potential
implications for other health initiatives seeking to promote behaviour
change are also discussed.

N2  - Objective: To examine how managed care affects physician financial
incentives to reduce services to their patients, particularly how this
relationship has evolved over time and whether the effects of capitated
managed care and noricapitated managed care are different.
Study Design: Retrospective study using Community Tracking Study
physician survey data from 2000-2001 and 2004-2005.
Methods: Physicians were included in the study sample only if they were
surveyed in both 2000-2001 and 2004-2005 (balanced panel data). The
study sample consisted of 4154 physicians, for a total of 8308
observations in 2 periods. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used
to analyze responses to questions regarding financial incentives,
involvement with managed care as a share of practice revenues, and
physician and practice characteristics.
Results: Both capitated and noricapitated managed care significantly
increased physician incentives to reduce care during 2000-2001, but
neither had a statistically significant effect on financial incentives
by 2004-2005. Capitated managed care rather than noricapitated managed
care created the strongest incentives to reduce care; however, even
these effects became rather weak during 2004-2005 compared with those in
2000-2001.
Conclusion: Managed care and traditional indemnity plans were
substantially more similar in their effects on physician incentives to
provide care by 2004-2005 than they were just 3 years earlier. This
should alleviate policy concerns that managed care is providing
physicians with the ``wrong{''} financial incentives to provide care.

N2  - OBJECTIVE To increase the overall 2007 response rate of the National
Physician Survey (NPS) from the survey's 2004 rate of response with the
implementation of various methodologic strategies.
DESIGN Physicians were stratified to receive either a long version (12
pages) or a short version (6 pages) of the survey (38% and 62%,
respectively). Mixed modes of contact were used-58% were contacted by
e-mail and 42% by regular mail-with multiple modes of contact attempted
for nonrespondents. The self-administered, confidential surveys were
distributed in either English or French. Medical residents and students
received e-mail surveys only and were offered a substantial monetary
lottery incentive for completing their surveys. A professional
communications firm assisted in marketing the survey and delivered
advance notification of its impending distribution.
SETTING Canada.
PARTICIPANTS A total of 62 441 practising physicians, 2627 second-year
medical residents, and 9162 medical students in Canada.
RESULTS Of the practising physicians group, 60 811 participants were
eligible and 19 239 replied, for an overall 2007 study response rate of
31.64% (compared with 35.85% in 2004). No difference in rate of
response was found between the longer and shorter versions of the
survey. If contacted by regular mail, the response rate was 34.1%; the
e-mail group had a response rate of 29.9%. Medical student and resident
response rates were 30.8% and 27.9%, respectively (compared with
31.2% and 35.6% in 2004).
CONCLUSION Despite shortening the questionnaires, contacting more
physicians by e-mail, and enhancing marketing and follow-up, the 2007
NPS response rate for practising physicians did not surpass the 2004 NPS
response rate. Offering a monetary lottery incentive to medical
residents and students was also unsuccessful in increasing their
response rates. The role of surveys in gathering information from
physicians and physicians-in-training remains problematic. Researchers
need to investigate alternative strategies for achieving higher rates of
response.

N2  - OBJECTIVE To explore potential solutions to the challenge of gaining
more respect for FPs from other specialists.
DESIGN An original Web-based qualitative survey, from May 27, 2004, to
January 5, 2005, involving 5 rounds.
SETTING Province of Alberta.
PARTICIPANTS A sample of 28 Alberta FPs of differing experience,
locations, and types of practices.
METHODS Purposeful maximum variation sampling was used to identify a
heterogeneous sample of FPs. The Delphi technique was used with an
anonymous, iterative, Web-based survey to develop consensus among
participating FPs. The first 2 rounds of the survey were designed to
generate rich, thick descriptions of the rewards and challenges FPs
experienced; the last 3 rounds were designed to refine this information
and identify potential solutions and support that key organizations
could provide. This information was collapsed into themes using thematic
content analysis and reviewed by a working group; with input from the
working group we decided to focus our analysis on the challenge of
gaining respect from specialists.
MAIN FINDINGS Each round yielded an 86% to 96% response rate, from
which 11 key challenges were identified including ``respect from
specialists.{''} Suggestions of potential solutions to gaining more
respect included the need to create and develop relationships between
FPs and other specialists and to support each other's roles; to raise
the profile of family medicine in universities and teaching hospitals;
to change negative attitudes by promoting the expertise and role of
family medicine to others; to demonstrate and maintain a comprehensive
skill set; and to address intraprofessional inequities and provide
appropriate incentives. Participants suggested roles that organizations
could play; for example, universities and medical schools could avoid
making negative comments about family practice, reward FPs involved in
teaching, and decentralize medical education to provide more experience
in community settings and environments that model interactions between
specialists and FPs. Organizations could recognize and promote the role
that FPs play in the health care system, seek their input into decisions
involving primary care, and move toward equitable and fair remuneration.
CONCLUSION Perceived lack of respect toward FPs from some of their
specialist colleagues might be reflective of issues that go beyond
family physician-specialist interaction. Solutions will likely require
the involvement of academic centres and other organizations.

N2  - Reproductive management has received increased attention in recent years
as new technologies and programs have been developed to aid dairy
managers in efficiently breeding cows and heifers. Efficient breeding of
cows and heifers has become increasingly difficult as fertility has
decreased because of a correlated negative response with milk yield.
Dairy farm survey results were used to parameterize the economic
analyses of reproductive management programs. Reproductive management
program costs and the levels of reproductive performance achieved with
such programs varied significantly among farms and were especially
sensitive to on-farm labor costs. For example, visual heat detection
requires more hours of labor per cow than use of an estrus
synchronization program. Therefore, visual heat detection programs were
relatively more sensitive to labor costs than synchronization programs.
In addition, past reproductive performance was found to affect the
determination of which reproductive program was optimal. Farms that had
attained high levels of labor efficiency for visual heat detection in
the past had less incentive to adopt a synchronization program than
farms with less efficient visual heat detection.

N2  - Tropical countries face special specific problems in implementing
sustainable forest management (SFM). In many countries, questions are
raised on whether tropical forests should be publicly, commonly or
privately owned and managed in order to enhance sustainability. Other
debates also focus on whether small-scale enterprises are better
positioned than large-scale industrial concessions to reduce poverty and
attain sustainable management. In countries where large tracts of forest
are state-owned, concessions are viewed as a means of delivering
services of public and collective interest through an association of
private investment and public regulation. However, the success of an
industrial concession model in countries with large forest resource
endowment to achieve multiple goals such as sustainable forest
management and local/regional development depends on two critical
assumptions. First, forest functions and services should be managed and
maintained as public goods. In many cases, additional uses - and
corresponding rights - can take place alongside logging activities.
Industrial concessions can be more efficient than other tenure models
(such as community-based forest management and small-scale enterprises)
in achieving SFM, add value to raw material and comply with growing
environmental norms. This is especially the case in market-remote areas
with low population density and poor infrastructure. Secondly, to
achieve these different outcomes, any concession system needs to be
monitored and regulated, especially in contexts dominated by
asymmetrical information between regulating authorities and
concessionaires. New institutional responses have recently been put
forward in several countries, providing valuable materials to design a
renewed policy mix which associates public and private incentives. This
paper provides a survey of the experience of forest concessions in
several Central African and South American countries. The concession
system is examined in order to clarify the issues involved, the problems
encountered, and what can be learned from the shared experience of these
countries in the last decade. This paper argues that despite a sometimes
patchy record, concessions can help promote SFM so long as they are
packaged with a certain number of specific measures. (C) 2008 Elsevier

N2  - Background: Baby boomers approaching retirement will include
unprecedented numbers of physicians, many of whom want to remain
productive.
Objective: To determine interest in health care - related volunteering
during retirement among physicians trained to provide general medical
care to adults.
Design: Cross-sectional mailed survey conducted May through July 2006.
Setting: North Carolina.
Participants: 910 physicians, 55 years of age or older, whose primary
specialty involved direct, nonsurgical care of adults.
Measurements: Current volunteerism and future interest in selected
activities.
Results: Of the respondents, 89.8% were male and 87.4% were white;
57.4% worked full-time, 21.7% worked part-time, and 21.0% were
retired. Of current retirees, 37.1% expressed interest in volunteering.
Areas of greatest interest were medical teaching, working in free
medical clinics, and international care. Strong incentives included
staying mentally active (67.3%) or involved in medicine (61.2%) and
contributing to society (60.5%). Substantial barriers included concerns
about malpractice (61.5%) and paperwork or bureaucracy (46.0%). The
majority of respondents (66.7%) felt that lack of payment would not
influence volunteering.
Limitations: The 59% overall response rate and exclusion of unlicensed
retired physicians limit study generalizability. The data were provided
by self-response and could not be independently validated.
Conclusion: Retired physicians are a potential source of manpower that
could contribute to provision of health care, particularly in medical
teaching and clinical care of underserved persons.

demographic and health information using surveys and steps/d at baseline
and during the last week the participants were in the program. A 1-year
follow-up was conducted, but in keeping with real-world conditions, no
incentives were offered to participate. Results: Participants (89%
female, age 48.1 {[}SD = 12] years) took 7864 (3114) steps/d at
baseline. Postprogram voluntary response rates to mailed surveys were
41.3% at 12 weeks and 22.8% at 1 year. Program completers reported
significantly higher steps/d at 12 weeks (similar to 12,000 steps/d) and
1 year (similar to 11,000 steps/d) compared with baseline. Conclusions:
The improvement in steps/d in this real-world implementation was
consistent with more controlled studies of pedometer-based
interventions. Low response to voluntary follow-up is a study limitation
but is expected of real-world evaluations.

their parents would affect both parent response and subsequent (i.e.,
``downstream{''}) survey response from the YAs. Parents were randomly
assigned to one of three incentive conditions: $0 (N = 97), $1 (N =

effect on parent response during the parent mail/phone sequence, and
mild evidence at the end of the parent effort. We found no parent
incentive effect on final YA survey response. We did, however, find an
effect on early YA survey response. For example, at 30 days following
the initial survey mailing, YA survey response was 46.4 percent, 61.2
percent, and 58.8 percent for those whose parents received $0, $1, and
$2, respectively (p = .03). Also, we found that giving $1 or $2 to
parents increased the speed of YA survey response by 34 percent (p =
.02). We found no evidence for a differential parent incentive effect on
the speed of survey response between female and male YAs. The increase
in the YA survey response speed imparted by a $1 or $2 incentive to
parents can more than pay for itself by substantially reducing the
proportion of YAs requiring intensive follow-up efforts.

N2  - For over 35 years, a random sample of U.S. women has responded for free
to a government survey that tracks their socioeconomic development. In
2003 an experiment was run to understand if providing monetary
incentives of up to $40 would impact participation rates. Providing
incentives to respondents, who previously refused to participate in the
last survey round, significantly boosted response rates, and resulted in
longer interviews and more items answered. However, providing monetary
incentives to previously willing respondents showed a mixed impact on
response rates, interview times, and items answered.

conducted, evaluating the format of training in pain management and the
self-assessed adequacy of the training. The response rate was 70%, with
188 total respondents. It included all programs in a large Midwestern
state, representing Most Specialties. Just over half of all programs
offered any formal training in pain management, and even fewer required
it. Less than one quarter required a clinical component to such
training. Nonetheless, an overwhelming majority of program directors
(85%) rated their training as adequate or excellent. Improvements are
clearly needed in postgraduate training in pain management, and external
incentives, such as requirements in the accreditation process, will be
needed.

rural areas of Nepal.
Design: A qualitative study using triangulation of data from one postal
questionnaire, one hand-delivered questionnaire with semistructured
interview and focus group discussions. Data from a small community
survey from 13 rural districts also included.
Participants: Sixty-two Nepali GPs, 25 doctors in General Practice
training programs, 11 individuals involved in policy development and
rural health care.
Results: The key issues identified by this study as critical to the
retention of Nepali GPs in rural areas were:
Career/promotion prospects
Status/recognition
Financial incentives
Working conditions
Education for children
Continuing medical education
Political stability and security
Conclusions: The strongest theme was that of career development. This
must be addressed by the Government of Nepal if there is to be any hope
of improving retention of GPs in rural areas. GPs need to have a clear
career ladder, with recognition of the value of service in rural areas.
There is, however, no one single answer to the complex interacting
factors that impact on GP retention in rural Nepal. A multifaceted,
holistic response is necessary. From the level of community awareness, a
career structure and financial remuneration to adequately set up
hospitals, functional teams, family support, continuing professional
development and a secure working environment - each area must be
addressed for the whole to function.

N2  - This study meta-analyzes thirty-nine study results published within last
ten years that directly compared Web and mail survey modes. Although
considerable variation exists across the studies, the authors' findings
show that mail surveys have higher response rates than Web surveys in
general. Two study features (i.e., population types and follow-up
reminders) are shown to contribute statistically to the variation of
response rate differences between Web and paper surveys in the
comparative studies. College respondents appear to be more responsive to
Web surveys, while some other respondents (e.g., medical doctors, school
teachers, and general consumers) appear to prefer traditional mail
surveys. Follow-up reminders appear to be less effective for Web survey
respondents than for mail survey respondents. Other study features
(i.e., implementation of random assignment of survey respondents,
incentives, and publication year) are not statistically useful in
accounting for the variation of response rate differences between Web
and mail surveys.

N2  - Objective. To identify predictors of changes in staff morale and burnout
associated with participation in a quality improvement (QI) initiative
at community health centers (HCs).
Data Sources. Surveys of staff at 145 HCs participating in the Health
Disparities Collaboratives (HDC) program in 2004.
Data Collection and Study Design. Self-administered questionnaire data
collected from 622 HC staff (68 percent response rate) were analyzed to
identify predictors of reported change in staff morale and burnout.
Predictive categories included outcomes of the QI initiative, levels of
HDC integration, institutional support, the use of incentives, and
demographic characteristics of respondents and centers.
Principal Findings. Perceived improvements in staff morale and reduced
likelihood of staff burnout were associated with receiving personal
recognition, career promotion, and skill development opportunities.
Similar outcomes were associated with sufficient funding and personnel,
fair distribution of work, effective training of new hires, and
consistent provider participation.
Conclusions. Having sufficient personnel available to administer the HDC
was found to be the strongest predictor of team member satisfaction.
However, a number of low-cost, reasonably modifiable, organizational and
leadership characteristics were also identified, which may facilitate
improvements in staff morale and reduce the likelihood of staff burnout
at HCs participating in the HDC.

N2  - This study examines the response rates for surveys used in
organizational research. We analysed 1607 studies published in the years
2000 and 2005 in 17 refereed academic journals, and we identified 490
different studies that utilized surveys. We examined the response rates
in these studies, which covered more than 100,000 organizations and
400,000 individual respondents. The average response rate for studies
that utilized data collected from individuals was 52.7 percent with a
standard deviation of 20.4, while the average response rate for studies
that utilized data collected from organizations was 35.7 percent with a
standard deviation of 18.8. Key insights from further analysis include
relative stability in response rates in the past decade and higher
response rates for journals published in the USA. The use of incentives
was not found to be related to response rates and, for studies of
organizations, the use of reminders was associated with lower response
rates. Also, electronic data collection efforts (e. g. email, phone,
web) resulted in response rates as high as or higher than traditional
mail methodology. We discuss a number of implications and
recommendations.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Children's health is an important indicator of community
health because children are especially vulnerable to disease. The school
setting is ideal for assessing these vulnerabilities and prevalence of
disease, yet the methods that produce high participation among students
and their families are not usually described or evaluated. This is
important because high participation rates increase reliability of data
and interpretation of results.
METHODS: In order to determine which methods produce the highest
response rates in a parent-report school-based survey, a child-focused
protocol, consisting of a brief classroom presentation and incentives
for participation, was compared to a parent/teacher outreach method and
a teacher-only outreach protocol. Methods were implemented in schools
matched on student demographics and neighborhood socioeconomic level.
The child-focused method was found to yield the highest response rate;
thus, it was deployed in 26 schools to determine its effectiveness in
schools of varying socioeconomic levels.
RESULTS: Response rates were highest using the child-focused protocol
when compared to those resulting from the parent/teacher outreach or the
teacher-only protocols (80.5% vs 74.7%, 83.4% vs 45.8%,
respectively). After full deployment, the response rate of the
child-focused protocol was 76.9% (70.8-82.8%), with 46.9% of
classrooms achieving a response rate of 80% or greater. The sample
obtained was highly representative in racial/ethnic distribution, as
evidenced by its strong correlation with the individual school
enrollment, the 5- to 12-year-old population of surrounding ZIP codes,
and the New York City public school population.
CONCLUSION: Participatory research methods that engage schoolchildren
and school staff directly in the research process yield the highest
response rates for school-based studies and provide educational benefits
for the school community.

N2  - Background: Recent experiences of survey researchers suggest that
physicians are becoming less willing to complete surveys. Objective: To
compare response rates to a mailed physician survey with a prepaid check
incentive of $20 versus $50.
Research Design: Randomized controlled trial. Subjects: Five hundred
seventy-eight physicians caring for patients with lung or colorectal
cancer in northern California. Measures: Proportion of physicians
responding to the survey.
Results: Overall, 60.0% of physicians responded to the survey. The
response rate was 52.1% for physicians who received a $20 check versus
67.8% for physicians who received a $50 check (P < 0.001). Similar
differences in response rates were seen in strata by physician sex, year
graduated from medical school, and survey version (all P < 0.001). More
than 42% of physicians who received a $50 check responded to the first
mailing, compared with only 30.8% of those who received a $20 check (P
< 0.001).
Conclusions: Among physicians caring for patients with lung cancer or
colorectal cancer in nor-them California, a $50 check incentive was
much more effective than a $20 check incentive at increasing response
rates to a mailed survey. As physicians become increasingly burdened
with surveys, larger incentives may be necessary to engage potential
respondents and thus maximize response rates.

N2  - Objectives:To examine the use of financial incentives related to
performance on quality measures reported by oncologists and surgeons
associated with a population-based cohort of patients with breast cancer
in Los Angeles County, California, and to explore the physician and
practice characteristics associated with the use of these incentives
among breast cancer care providers.
Study Design: Cross-sectional observational study.
Methods: Physician self-reported financial arrangements from a survey of
348 medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and surgeons caring for
patients with breast cancer in Los Angeles County (response rate, 76%).
Physicians were asked whether they were subject to financial incentives
for quality (ie, patient satisfaction surveys and adherence to practice
guidelines). We examined the prevalence and correlates of incentives and
performed multivariate logistic regression analyses to assess predictors
of incentives, controlling for other covariates.
Results: Twenty percent of respondents reported incentives based on
patient satisfaction, and 15% reported incentives based on guideline
adherence. The use of incentives for quality in this cohort of
oncologists and surgeons was modest and was primarily associated with
staff- or group-model health maintenance organization (HMO) settings. In
other settings, important predictors were partial physician ownership
interest, large practice size, and capitation.
Conclusions: Most cancer care providers in Los Angeles County outside of
staff- or group-model HMOs are not subject to explicit financial
incentives based on quality-of-care measures. Those who are, seem more
likely to be associated with large practice settings. New approaches are
needed to direct financial incentives for quality toward specialists
outside of staff- or group-model HMOs if pay-for-performance programs
are to succeed in influencing care.

N2  - The recently-described Arunachal macaque Macaca munzala is so far known
only from western Arunachal Pradesh, north-east India. Here we present
the first conservation status assessment for the species. Our surveys
enumerated a total of 569 individuals in the Tawang and West Kameng
districts of the State. The species seems to be tolerant of
anthropogenic habitat change but is vulnerable to hunting. A low infant
to adult female ratio suggests that not all adult females reproduce at
any given time, and females do not give birth every year. The macaques
are persecuted largely in response to crop damage, with the practice of
keeping them as pets providing an added incentive to hunting. The
species is, however, able to attain remarkably high densities in the
absence of hunting. Crop damage by the macaque is widespread; patterns
of crop damage are similar across altitudinal zones and do not seem to
be correlated with macaque density. The species will need to be
protected in human-modified landscapes, and the issues of crop damage
and retaliatory persecution need to be addressed urgently.

N2  - Purpose: Limited previous data suggest that heterogeneity exists in the
treatment approaches for women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). We
sought in a longitudinal cohort study of women with DCIS to assess the
attitudes and management approaches toward DICIS among physicians who
provide care to women. Materials and Methods: Eligible physicians were
invited to participate In a 1-time mailed survey. A financial incentive
and reminders were used to enhance the response rate. Physician
perception of risks associated with DCIS for patients and management
approaches were evaluated. Results: Two hundred and eight physicians
were identified, and 151 (73%) completed the survey. Respondents had a
median age of 49 years (range, 32-75 years), and most were surgeons or
medical oncologists (66%). Eighty-eight percent reported seeing an
average of >= 1 new patient with DCIS per month. In a multivariable
model, physicians who cared for proportionately fewer patients with
breast cancer were more likely to view DICIS as a riskier disease to a
patient's overall health compared with physicians who cared for more
women with breast cancer (odds ratio, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1-4.6; P = .036).
Physicians exhibited differences in management approaches when
considering theoretical patients with DICIS and did not use consistent
terms when speaking with patients with DCIS. Conclusion: Substantial
variation exists among physicians regarding perceptions and management
approaches for women with DCIS. In some settings, risks of
physician-recommended therapy might outweigh benefits. Further
evaluation of the effects of physician management approaches and
attitudes about DCIS on patient outcomes is warranted.

N2  - Background: Health plans in the United States are struggling to contain
rapid growth in their spending on medications. They have responded by
implementing multi-tiered formularies, which label certain brand
medications `non-preferred' and require higher patient copayments for
those medications. This multi-tier policy relies on patients'
willingness to switch medications in response to copayment
differentials. The antidepressant class has certain characteristics that
may pose problems for implementation of three-tier formularies, such as
differences in which medication works for which patient, and high rates
of medication discontinuation.
Aims of the Study: To measure the effect of a three-tier formulary on
antidepressant utilization and spending, including decomposing spending
allocations between patient and plan.
Methods: We use claims and eligibility files for a large, mature
nonprofit managed care organization that started introducing its
three-tier formulary on January 1, 2000, with a staggered implementation
across employer groups. The sample includes 109,686 individuals who were
continuously enrolled members during the study period. We use a
pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design that includes a comparison
group, comprising members whose employer had not adopted three-tier as
of March 1, 2000. This permits some control for potentially confounding
changes that could have coincided with three-tier implementation.
Results: For the antidepressants that became nonpreferred, prescriptions
per enrollee decreased 11% in the three-tier group and increased 5% in
the comparison group. The own-copay elasticity of demand for
nonpreferred drugs can be approximated as -0.11.
Difference-in-differences regression finds that the three-tier formulary
slowed the growth in the probability of using antidepressants in the
post-period, which was 0.3 percentage points lower than it would have
been without three-tier. The three-tier formulary also increased
out-of-pocket payments while reducing plan payments and total spending.
Discussion: The results indicate that the plan enrollees were somewhat
responsive to the changed incentives, shifting away from the drugs that
became nonpreferred. However, the intervention also resulted in
cost-shifting from plan to enrollees, indicating some
price-inelasticity. The reduction in the proportion of enrollees filling
any prescriptions contrasts with results of prior studies for
non-psychotropic drug classes. Limitations include the possibility of
confounding changes coinciding with three-tier implementation (if they
affected the two groups difterentially); restriction to continuous
enrollees; and lack of data on rebates the plan paid to drug
manufacturers.
Implications for Health Care Provision and Use: The results of this
study suggest that the impact of the three-tier formulary approach may
be somewhat different for antidepressants than for some other classes.
Implications for Health Policy: Policymakers should monitor the effects
of three-tier programs on utilization in psychotropic medication
classes.
Implications for Further Research: Future studies should seek to
understand the reasons for patients' limited response to the change in
incentives, perhaps using physician and/or patient surveys. Studies
should also examine the effects of three-tier programs on patient
adherence, quality of care, and clinical and economic outcomes.

N2  - Respondent incentives are increasingly used as a measure of combating
falling response rates and resulting risks of nonresponse bias.
Nonresponse in panel surveys is particularly problematic, since even low
wave-on-wave nonresponse rates can lead to substantial cumulative
losses; if nonresponse is differential, this may lead to increasing bias
across waves. Although the effects of incentives have been studied
extensively in cross-sectional contexts, little is known about
cumulative effects across waves of a panel. We provide new evidence
about the effects of continued incentive payments on attrition, bias and
item nonresponse, using data from a large scale, multi-wave, mixed mode
incentive experiment on a UK government panel survey of young people. In
this study, incentives significantly reduced attrition, far outweighing
negative effects on item response rates in terms of the amount of
information collected by the survey per issued case. Incentives had
proportionate effects on retention rates across a range of respondent
characteristics and as a result did not reduce attrition bias in terms
of those characteristics. The effects of incentives on retention rates
were larger for unconditional than conditional incentives and larger in
postal than telephone mode. Across waves, the effects on attrition
decreased somewhat, although the effects on item nonresponse and the
lack of effect on bias remained constant. The effects of incentives at
later waves appeared to be independent of incentive treatments and mode
of data collection at earlier waves.

N2  - Background: With the growing use of Internet-based interventions,
strategies are needed to encourage broader participation. This study
examined the effects of combinations of monetary incentives and mailing
characteristics on enrollment, retention, and cost effectiveness for an
online health program.
Methods: In 2004, a recruitment letter was mailed to randomly selected
Midwestern integrated health system members aged 21-65 and stratified by
gender and race/ethnicity; recipients were randomly pre-assigned to one
of 24 combinations of incentives and various mailing characteristics.
Enrollment and 3-month retention rates were measured by completion of
online surveys. Analysis, completed in 2005, compared enrollment and
retention factors using t tests and chi-square tests. Multivariate
logistic regression modeling assessed the probability of enrollment and
retention.
Results: Of 12,289 subjects, 531 (4.3%) enrolled online, ranging from
1% to 11% by incentive combination. Highest enrollment occurred with
unconditional incentives, and responses varied by gender. Retention
rates ranged from 0% to 100%, with highest retention linked to
higher-value incentives. The combination of a $2 bill prepaid incentive
and the promise of $20 for retention (10% enrollment and 71%
retention) was optimal, considering per-subject recruitment costs ($32
enrollment, $70 retention) and equivalent enrollment by gender and
race/ethnicity.
Conclusions: Cash incentives improved enrollment in an online health
program. Men and women responded differently to mailing characteristics
and incentives. Including a small prepaid monetary incentive ($2 or
$5) and revealing the higher promised-retention incentive was cost
effective and boosted enrollment.

Netherlands.
Patient(s): One thousand seventy-nine subfertile couples who underwent
IUI treatment between April 2000 and August 2002.
Result(s): The response rate was 71 %. Many subfertile couples have had
negative experiences with IUI care, particularly regarding the doctor's
attitude and coordination of care. Among several patient and hospital
characteristics that significantly predicted these negative experiences,
the main predictors were no ongoing pregnancy and high education level.
Conclusion(s): From the perspective of subfertile couples, several
aspects of IUI care are in serious need of improvement, particularly
care aspects regarding the doctor's attitude and coordination of care.
These findings are an important incentive for developing tailored
interventions that address the reported deficits in IUI care to meet
subfertile couples' needs better.

Providers and Systems (CAHPS((R))) survey to examine the experiences of
Hispanics enrolled in Medicare managed care. Evaluations of care are
examined in relationship to primary language (English or Spanish) and
region of the country.
Data Sources. CAHPS 3.0 Medicare managed care survey data collected in
2002.
Study Design. The dependent variables consist of five CAHPS multi-item
scales measuring timeliness of care, provider communication, office
staff helpfulness, getting needed care, and health plan customer
service. The main independent variables are Hispanic primary language
(English or Spanish) and region (California, Florida, New York/New
Jersey, and other states). Ordinary least squares regression is used to
model the effect of Hispanic primary language and region on CAHPS
scales, controlling for age, gender, education, and self-rated health.
Data Collection/Extraction Methods. The analytic sample consists of
125,369 respondents (82 percent response rate) enrolled in 181 Medicare
managed care plans across the U.S. Of the 125,369 respondents, 8,463 (7
percent) were self-identified as Hispanic. The survey was made available
in English and Spanish, and 1,353 Hispanics completed one in Spanish.
Primary Finding. Hispanic English speakers had less favorable reports of
care than whites for all dimensions of care except provider
communication. Hispanic Spanish speakers reported more negative
experiences than whites with timeliness of care, provider communication,
and office staff helpfulness, but better reports of care for getting
needed care. Spanish speakers in all regions except Florida had less
favorable scores than English-speaking Hispanics for provider
communication and office staff helpfulness, but more positive
assessments for getting needed care. There were greater regional
variations in CAHPS scores among Hispanic Spanish speakers than among
Hispanic English speakers. Spanish speakers in Florida had more positive
experiences than Spanish speakers in other regions for most dimensions
of care.
Conclusions. Hispanics in Medicare managed care face barriers to care;
however, their experiences with care vary by language and region.
Spanish speakers (except FL) have less favorable experiences with
provider communication and office staff helpfulness than their
English-speaking counterparts, suggesting language barriers in the
clinical encounter. On the other hand, Spanish speakers reported more
favorable experiences than their English-speaking counterparts with the
managed care aspects of their care (getting needed care and plan
customer service). Medicare managed care plans need to address the
observed disparities in patient experiences among Hispanics as part of
their quality improvement efforts. Plans can work with their network
providers to address issues related to timeliness of care and office
staff helpfulness. In addition, plans can provide incentives for
language services, which have the potential to improve communication
with providers and staff among Spanish speakers. Finally, health plans
can reduce the access barriers faced by Hispanics, especially among
English speakers.

N2  - Nationwide, private land conservation (PLC) is on the rise. Land trusts,
local government open space and natural area programs, and revised land
use codes, as well as federal and state tax laws, combine to offer an
increasing number of incentives and opportunities for landowners to
consider. Such programs mitigate the loss of agricultural lands,
wildlife habitat, and open space occurring as a result of development
pressure. Larimer County, Colorado, has considerable development
pressure and a diversity of voluntary and quasi-regulatory programs that
stimulate PLC. This study probes the motivations, characteristics, and
management practices of the landowners involved, and how these differ
according to the mechanisms chosen to conserve private land. We surveyed
all County landowners (grantors) who conserved private land using
conservation easements, covenants, and cluster developments and
interviewed a subset of those landowners. The typical grantor is older,
married, well-educated, and likely retired. Five motivational domains
were derived from responses to survey items. The natural resource
protection domain was assigned the highest importance by participating
landowners followed by community-mindedness, family commitments,
financial incentives, and sustaining agricultural production.
Motivations also differ significantly according to the type of
conservation program utilized, geographic location, and the amount of
land owned. Half of the respondents were found to be quite to fully
engaged in management and monitoring activities. These and other
findings may be useful to local governments and other entities engaged
in private land conservation wishing to optimize available resources,
the approaches, and practices used with different landowners.

N2  - An important feature of a Contingent Value (CV) study is that
researchers design a survey that guides respondents to answer
dichotomous choice (DC) questions as if they represent once-and-for-all
choices. Researchers frequently construct hypothetical markets to
satisfy this condition; yet detractors assert that `hypotheticality'
leads inevitably to inflated DC responses. For active policy questions,
however, some respondents may suspect that a CV informs an actual policy
issue; so to reject a DC might induce the policy-maker to reintroduce
the policy with a price reduction or a program improvement. With
potential incentives to deflate a DC response when policies are active,
we locate two types of respondents that represent two different
incentives. One class is expected to be able to risk permanent rejection
of a waiver from one automobile emissions inspection. This class more
frequently rejects a DC value known to improve existing conditions.
Another respondent class is expected to be risk averse to defeat of the
program or to excessive delay. Predictably, these respondents more
frequently accept a DC value that represents a known gain. Conservative
DC responses have implications for the use of CV in active policy
contexts, opening a role for theory to assist practitioners in these
circumstances.

N2  - Background. One of the most fiercely debated strategies to increase the
number of kidneys for transplantation is the introduction of financial
incentives. As the success of such strategy largely depends on public
support, we performed a public survey on this topic.
Methods. We developed a questionnaire on financial incentives for living
kidney donation. We investigated the public opinion on two different
fixed compensations: either life-long health insurance compensation or
e25 000. Furthermore, we investigated public preferences on the
practical implementation: either the patient seeks a donor or the donor
registers for donation at an independent institute. For all examples,
health insurance companies would cover costs of treatment. TNS NIPO, a
professional organization for market research, sent the survey to a
response panel that is made representative for the general population.
Results. Five hundred fifty respondents (M/F: 60/40; median age: 46)
filled out the questionnaire. Forty-six percent considered the situation
wherein health insurance companies would introduce financial incentives
to increase the number of living kidney donors undesirable (26%
undesirable; 20% very undesirable), compared to 25% who perceived this
as desirable (20% desirable; 5% very desirable). The option wherein
the donor registers at an independent institute to donate to a patient
on the list and in turn receives life-long health insurance compensation
was chosen as most favourable. Of all respondents, 5.5% stated that
there was a (very) great chance that they would donate a kidney in order
to get compensation if such system were to be reality.
Conclusion. Although almost half of the respondents (46%) were
reluctant towards introducing a system with fixed compensation to
increase the number of living kidney donors, still 25% of the general
public reacted positively.

N2  - In random digit dial (RDD) telephone surveys, some proportion of the
sampled telephone numbers cannot definitively be classified as eligible
or ineligible. Each call attempt to these numbers generally results in
either a busy signal or a ring with no answer. According to the
profession's standard definitions, the proportion of these unresolved
numbers that are, in fact, eligible is known as ``e{''} and should be
accounted for in response rate calculations. We used call records and a
directory listed indicator from a survey with an extended calling period
(and other features - letters, incentives, etc.) to resolve as many
unknown cases as possible and thus derive an empirical estimate (.47)
for ``e.{''} We found additional support for this estimate by matching
the unresolved telephone numbers from a separate survey to residency
information from a commercial data vendor. The estimate of ``e{''}
applies to national RDD surveys featuring approximately a six-call
design.

N2  - Background: Continual quality improvement in primary care is an
international priority. In the United Kingdom, the major initiative for
improving quality of care is the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QoF) of
the 2004 GP contract. Although the primary focus of the QoF is on
clinical care, it is acknowledged that a comprehensive assessment of
quality also requires valid and reliable measurement of the patient
perspective, so financial incentives are included in the contract for
general practices to survey patients' views. One questionnaire specified
for use in the QoF is the General Practice Assessment Questionnaire
(GPAQ). This paper describes the development of the GPAQ (with
post-consultation and postal versions) and presents a preliminary
examination of the psychometric properties of the questionnaire.
Methods: Description of scale development and preliminary analysis of
psychometric characteristics (internal reliability, factor structure),
based on a large dataset of routinely collected GPAQ surveys (n =
190,038 responses to the consultation version of GPAQ and 20,309
responses to the postal version) from practices in the United Kingdom
during the 2005-6 contract year.
Results: Respondents tend to report generally favourable ratings.
Responses were particularly skewed on the GP communication scale, though
no more so than for other questionnaires in current use in the UK for
which data were available. Factor analysis identified 2 factors that
clearly relate to core concepts in primary care quality ('access' and
`interpersonal care') that were common to both version of the GPAQ. The
other factors related to `enablement' in the post-consultation version
and `nursing care' in the postal version.
Conclusion: This preliminary evaluation indicates that the scales of the
GPAQ are internally reliable and that the items demonstrate an
interpretable factor structure. Issues concerning the distributions of
GPAQ responses are discussed. Potential further developments of the item
content for the GPAQ are also outlined.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Safety climate is often measured via surveys to identify
appropriate patient safety interventions. The introduction of an
insurance premium incentive for simulation-based anesthesia crisis
resource management (CRM) training motivated our naturalistic experiment
to compare the safety climates of several departments and to assess the
impact of the training.
METHODS: We administered a 59-item survey to anesthesia providers in six
academic anesthesia programs (Phase 1). Faculty in four of the programs
subsequently participated in a CRM program using simulation. The survey
was readministered 3 yr later (Phase 2). Factor analysis was used to
create scales regarding common safety themes. Positive safety climate
(% of respondents with positive safety attitudes) was computed for the
scales to indicate the safety climate levels.
RESULTS: The usable response rate was 44% (309/708) and 38% (293/772)
in Phases 1 and 2 respectively. There was wide variation in response
rates among hospitals and providers. Eight scales were identified. There
were significantly different climate scores among hospitals but no
difference between the trained and untrained cohorts. The positive
safety climate scores varied from 6% to 94% on specific survey
questions. Faculty and residents had significantly different perceptions
of the degree to which residents are debriefed about their difficult
clinical situations.
CONCLUSIONS: Safety climate indicators can. vary substantially among
anesthesia practice groups. Scale scores and responses to specific
questions can suggest practices for improvement. Overall safety climate
is probably not a good criterion for assessing the impact of
simulation-based CRM training. Training alone was insufficient to alter
engrained behaviors in the absence of further reinforcing actions.

N2  - Evidence shows that minority patients are underrepresented in clinical
trials. The development of new drugs and treatments, however, requires
that clinical research studies include representative participants,
particularly in light of evidence indicating that minority populations
sometimes respond differently to prescription medications. Racial
disparities among clinical investigators are often cited as a major
reason why minority patients are underrepresented in clinical trials.
However, there is little to no empirical data to support or refute the
prevalence of disparities among clinical investigators. The Tufts Center
conducted two online surveys of 1376 physicians. The first survey (N =
859 respondents; 31% response rate) assessed the overall incidence of
minority physician involvement in clinical research. The second survey (
N = 768 respondents; 20% response rate) assessed the demographics,
experience, and infrastructure of minority physicians who have
participated in clinical research as a principal investigator or
subinvestigator. The results of this study indicate that significant
racial disparities exist among clinical investigators. The results also
support assertions that physician race influences race of the clinical
trial volunteer. The incidence of participation in clinical research
among minority physicians is well below that observed among white
physicians, more so with regard to U. S. Food & Drug
Administration-regulated clinical trials funded by industry. Minority
investigators tend to conduct and initiate fewer clinical trials
annually. Yet minority and white physician interest in participating in
clinical research is similarly high. Minority investigators tend be
younger, with more limited clinical research infrastructure and support
than their white counterparts. New strategies, policies, incentives, and
reforms are needed to address racial disparities among clinical
investigators. In addition, disparities among both volunteers and
investigators need to be tracked more closely and methodically to
monitor and assess the impact of newly implemented programs and reforms.

N2  - Aim. To explore barriers to, and incentives for, clients on
methadone-maintenance treatment (MMT) in Auckland, New Zealand to
transfer from secondary care to general practitioner (GP) care. Design.
Surveys (with free text response sections) of MMT secondary care staff,
stabilised clinic clients, authorised GPs and GP patients. Results. High
response rates from secondary care staff (77%) and GPs (74%). Barriers
to stable clients' transfer included financial cost and attitudes of
secondary care staff and clients. Incentives for patient transfer
included confidentiality, a holistic approach to their care, continuity
of care, increased patient control, convenience and avoidance of contact
with other opioid-dependent people. Distrust in the quality of care
provided by authorised GPs was a major barrier for some secondary care
staff and their clients, despite prerequisite training for
authorisation. In contrast, patients rated primary better than secondary
care with none stating a likelihood to return to the secondary service
within 6 months. Conclusions. Progression from secondary to primary care
should be incorporated in MMT planning from the outset, with secondary
services staff reassured about the quality of primary care. An
integrated transition period and exploration of funding options to
assist transfer from largely publicly funded secondary to largely
privately funded primary care are also recommended.

N2  - Introduction. Screening and brief intervention (SBI) for alcohol
consumption in primary care have been shown to be effective in reducing
drinking. This role has not been taken up by community pharmacists. This
study aimed to explore attitudes, knowledge, barriers and incentives
towards involvement of community pharmacists in New Zealand with problem
drinkers. Method. A postal survey (three mailshots) of community
pharmacies was undertaken in Auckland, New Zealand, followed by a 10%
random sample non-responder-follow-up. Results. A response rate of
39.1% to the postal survey was obtained. In general, knowledge of
alcohol content of drinks and recommended safe drinking limits was poor.
Respondents were generally well motivated towards undertaking this role,
but lacked knowledge, skills and confidence. On follow-up,
non-responders were found to be less knowledgeable, but had similar
attitudes to respondents, indicating potential for extrapolation with
regard to beliefs and views on this subject. Discussion. This novel
study has found that there is potential for involvement of community
pharmacists in New Zealand in SBI for problem drinkers. Lack of
knowledge can be remedied relatively easily; greater hurdles such as
lack of skills, and lack of confidence may be offset by the high level
of motivation of this group. This is an area where community pharmacists
can further their professional scope of practice by being in an
essential position to provide this service.

N2  - One question that arises when discussing the usefulness of web-based
surveys is whether they gain the same response rates compared to other
modes of collecting survey data. A common perception exists that, in
general, web survey response rates are considerably lower. However, such
unsystematic anecdotal evidence could be misleading and does not provide
any useful quantitative estimate. Meta-analytic procedures synthesising
controlled experimental mode comparisons could give accurate answers
but, to the best of the authors' knowledge, such research syntheses have
so far not been conducted.
To overcome this gap, the authors have conducted a meta-analysis of 45
published and unpublished experimental comparisons between web and other
survey modes. On average, web surveys yield an 11% lower response rate
compared to other modes (the 95% confidence interval is confined by
15% and 6% to the disadvantage of the web mode).
This response rate difference to the disadvantage of the web mode is
systematically influenced by the sample recruitment base (a smaller
difference for panel members as compared to one-time respondents), the
solicitation mode chosen for web surveys (a greater difference for
postal mail solicitation compared to email) and the number of contacts
(the more contacts, the larger the difference in response rates between
modes). No significant influence on response rate differences can be
revealed for the type of mode web surveys are compared to, the type of
target population, the type of sponsorship, whether or not incentives
were offered, and the year the studies were conducted. Practical
implications are discussed.

N2  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a snapshot of
environmental management practices in the UK and discuss managerial
responses to environmental issues in comparison with earlier research.
Design/methodology/approach - A telephone interview survey approach is
adopted encompassing both quantitative and qualitative open-ended
questions with a sample of 167 UK companies stratified by firm size and
industry sector.
Findings - The majority of firms are undertaking efforts to reduce their
environmental impacts, yet economic considerations such as cost and risk
reductions and achieving compliance with environmental legislation
dominate firms' environmental behaviour. Especially small and
medium-sized firms appear to rely on relatively short-term planning
horizons, which ultimately prevent them from becoming more proactive in
their environmental outlook. Comparison with earlier studies suggests
that the overall behaviour of firms towards environmental issues remains
reactive and economically-oriented.
Research limitations/implications - Despite the growing salience of many
enviromnental challenges, businesses fail to employ more proactive
environmental strategies, suggesting that more has to be done at policy
level to stimulate the incentives involved with adopting such an
approach.
Originality/value - By using a mixed methods approach the paper aims to
overcome problems of respondent identification and social desirability
bias.

N2  - Previous work shows that, as the buyer's uncertainty about the quality
of some good or service increases, so does the tendency to purchase that
good or service via embedded transactions, rather than from strangers.
While this previous work explains variation in embedded exchange across
different types of purchases, it does not address variation in embedded
exchange across persons. Our research integrates the embeddedness and
trust literatures to explain variation in within-network exchanges based
on an interaction of the purchaser's generalized trust and the level of
uncertainty entailed in the purchase (i.e., whether there exists an
incentive for the seller to misrepresent the quality of some good or
service). For purchases involving uncertainty, low-trusters will tend to
forgo risky transactions with strangers, opting instead for the
increased certainty of embedded markets. High-trusters, on the other
hand, will be more likely to transact with strangers (despite the
increased risk), from whom they can often find better deals. We should
not expect any differences between high- and low-trusters for products
that do not entail uncertainty. Results from two data sources, responses
from a nationally representative survey of the U.S. population and
behavioral responses in new laboratory experiments, provide support for
the arguments. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Stated preference (SP) methods have been used extensively in transport
research and elsewhere, both to forecast demand and to value the
importance attached to different product features and travel attributes.
Before introducing new or refurbished rolling stock as part of their
franchises, British Train Operating Companies (TOCs) have often carried
out SP surveys to investigate passenger preferences and to test whether
the improvement of the fleet and services is enough to recover the cost
through increased fares and patronage and thus to evaluate the costs and
benefits of this investment. The rolling stock value derived from SP
results is used not only for welfare appraisal and pricing but also for
rail demand forecasting. Alongside the broader acceptance and wider
application of SP methods, some practitioners have argued for greater
openness in discussing what they have seen as significant concerns
surrounding SP. The issue of the strategic biasing of SP responses was
specifically addressed by examining the incentive compatibility of SP
responses related to task complexity and the presence of specific
antibias warnings in the questionnaire. Methods to amend incentive to
bias were suggested. Adding cheap talk script reduces the overestimation
of valuation of improved rolling stock in the case study; however, bias
may remain. Adding more attributes to the SP experiment does not show a
significant impact on the estimation bias, but contributes to a higher
error variance in responses.

N2  - Although the successful enhancement of householders' participation in
kerbside recycling schemes is essential for household waste recycling
schemes to reach their desired levels of achievement, our understanding
of householders' responses to the various incentives available to waste
managers is incomplete. In particular, whether and how the recycling
behaviour of householders may be favourably altered through imposition
of financial penalties or rewards is not fully understood. Surveys of
householders' attitudes in the London Borough of Havering, served by a
kerbside co-mingled survival bag recycling scheme, showed they might be
better encouraged to recycle more through improvements to structural and
promotional aspects of the recycling scheme than through imposition of
financial incentives. If financial incentives were to be imposed to
enhance kerbside recycling, householders preferred: (1) rewards to
penalties, and (2) community-based rewards and local taxation rebates to
other or individual rewards. Given the attitudes of householders and the
resources that would be needed to monitor their recycling behaviour as a
basis for delivering financial incentives, it is suggested that the
priority for enhancing recycling should be to make appropriate
improvements in the infrastructure and support of the kerbside scheme
and service. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objective: Our aim was to analyze monetary incentives and shortening the
questionnaire as means of increasing response rates in a mailed
follow-up survey 1 year after inpatient psychotherapeutic treatment.
Additionally, effects on partial nonresponse and the assessment of
treatment outcome were examined.
Study Design and Setting: In a 2 x 2 factorial design, a sample of 3,825
patients was randomized to the two following interventions: (1)
receiving a prepaid monetary incentive or none; and (2) getting a short
or a long questionnaire. Treatment outcome was measured prospectively by
a self-assessment instrument for psychopathology.
Results: When using incentives, the response rate significantly
increased by 7.3% (95% confidence interval {[}CI] 2.6-11.9%).
Receiving a short questionnaire led to an augmentation of the response
rate of 3.7% (95% CI 0.9-8.3%), which was not significant. The
corresponding odds ratios were significantly increased for monetary
incentives (1.36; 95% CI 1.30-1.88), and when abridging the
questionnaire (1.15; 95% CI 1.01-1.31). However, partial nonresponse
and treatment outcome were independent of the two factors.
Conclusion: Incentives and a shorter questionnaire led to higher return
rates but did not affect partial nonresponse and self-report of
treatment outcome in a randomized postal survey. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

versus urban areas were more likely to view the following factors as
important to their practice decision: community need, financial aid,
community size, return to hometown, and rural training program
participation (P < .05). Those remaining rural versus moving away were
more likely to consider community size and return to hometown as
important (P < .05). Having enough work available, income potential,
professional opportunity, and serving community health needs were
important to all groups. Conclusion: Rural background and preference for
smaller sized communities are associated with both recruitment and
retention. Loan forgiveness and rural training programs appear to
support recruitment. Retention efforts must focus on financial
incentives, professional opportunity, and desirability of rural
locations.

N2  - Context Value-based purchasing by employers has often been portrayed as
the lynch-pin to quality improvement in a market-based health care
system. Although a small group of the largest national employers has
been actively engaged in promoting quality measurement, reporting, and
pay for performance, it is unknown whether these ideas have
significantly permeated employer-sponsored health benefit purchasing.
Objective To provide systematic descriptions and analyses of value-based
purchasing and related efforts to improve quality of care by health care
purchasers.
Design, Setting, and Participants We conducted telephone interviews with
executives at 609 of the largest employers across 41 US markets between
July 2005 and March 2006. The 41 randomly selected markets have at least
100 000 persons enrolled in health maintenance organizations, include
approximately 91% of individuals enrolled in health maintenance
organizations nationally, and represent roughly 78% of the US
metropolitan population. Using the Dun & Bradstreet database of US
employers, we identified the 26 largest firms in each market. Firms
ranged in size from 60 to 250 000 employees.
Main Outcome Measure The degree to which value-based purchasing and
related strategies are reported being used by employers. Percentages
were weighted by number of employees.
Results Of 1041 companies contacted, 609 employer representatives
completed the survey (response rate, 64%). A large percentage of
surveyed executives reported that they examine health plan quality data
(269 respondents; 65% {[}95% confidence interval {CI}, 57%-74%]; P
<. 001), but few reported using it for performance rewards (49
respondents; 17% {[} 95% CI, 7%-27%]; P=.008) or to influence
employees (71 respondents; 23% {[} 95% CI, 13%-33%]). Physician
quality information is even less commonly examined (71 respondents; 16%
{[} 95% CI, 9%-23%]) or used by employers to reward performance (8
respondents; 2% {[} 95% CI, 0%-3%]) or influence employee choice of
providers (34 respondents; 8% {[} 95% CI, 3%-12%]).
Conclusion Surveyed employers as a whole do not appear to be
individually implementing incentives and programs in line with
value-based purchasing ideals.

N2  - Land abandonment is causing woodland expansion and loss of open habitats
in the Alps, coupled with a shift in forestry practices from coppice
management to high forest. Despite such rapid large-scale changes, there
has been very little investigation of the environmental predictors of
biodiversity in the Alpine landscape. We assessed the richness of
amphibians, reptiles and breeding birds (n = 189 species), used as a
surrogate of biodiversity, in 58 quadrats of 100 km(2), located within a
well surveyed area of the province of Trento (central-eastern Italian
Alps). The surrogates were then related to a series of environmental
variables by means of stepwise multiple regression. Depending on the
surrogate analysed, species richness declined linearly or quadratically
with elevation, and increased with habitat heterogeneity and the
availability of grassland and arid-rocky habitats. The same results were
obtained when incorporating a measure of species threat into the
biodiversity estimates. Different surrogates were positively
inter-correlated, probably because of a common response to the same
factor, namely elevation, which was the only variable to enter all
models. Such elevational gradient produced a clear biodiversity peak in
low-elevation areas, generating potential conflict between efficient
biodiversity conservation and economic interests linked to human
development, a scenario which probably applies to many mountain regions
worldwide. The current network of protected areas was quite satisfactory
in terms of area covered but biased towards high-elevation areas, of
high scenic beauty but relatively low in animal biodiversity value.
Low-elevation reserves were small and isolated. Proposed conservation
targets include the establishment of corridors increasing the
connectivity of low-elevation reserves and the promotion of incentives
for the extensive management of grassland, an agro-ecosystem of high
historical and biological value.

N2  - This paper argues that labor market conditions are an important and
often overlooked determinant of retirement transitions. In our analysis,
we examine how the unemployment rate affects retirement and whether the
Social Security (SS) system and Unemployment Insurance (UI) system
influence how older workers respond to labor market shocks. We use
pooled cross-sectional data from the March Current Population Survey
(CPS) in our analysis. We find that downturns in the labor market
increase retirement transitions and that the magnitude of this effect is
comparable to that associated with moderate changes in financial
incentives to retire and to the threat of a health shock facing older
workers. Interestingly, retirements only increase in response to an
economic downturn once workers become SS-eligible, suggesting that
retirement benefits may help to alleviate the income loss associated
with a weak labor market. We also estimate the impact of UI generosity
on retirement and find little consistent evidence of an effect. This
suggests that in some ways SS may serve as a more effective form of
unemployment insurance for older workers than UI. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - During 2006, a survey was conducted of European energy stakeholders
(industry, government, environmental non-governmental organizations
(NGOs), researchers and academicians and parliamentarians). A total of
512 responses was received from 28 countries as follows: industry
(28%), research (34%), government (13%), NGOs (5%) and
parliamentarians (4%). Three-quarters of the sample thought that
widespread use of CO2 capture and storage (CCS) was `definitely' or
`probably necessary' to achieve deep reductions in CO2 emissions between
now and 2050 in their own country. Only one in eight considered that CCS
was `probably' or `definitely not necessary'. For a range of 12
identified risks, 20-40% thought that they would be `moderate' or `very
serious', whilst 60-80% thought that there would be no risks or that
the risks would be `minimal'. A particular risk identified by nearly
half the sample is the additional use of fossil fuels due to the `energy
penalty' incurred by CCS. Further concerns are that development of CCS
would detract from investment in renewable energy technologies. Half of
the respondents thought that incentives for CCS should be set either at
the same level as those for renewables or at a higher level.
Environmental NGOs were consistently less enthusiastic about CCS than
the energy industry. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Germany is one of few countries in which the monetary compensation for
inventors is not only determined by negotiations between employer and
employee-inventor, but also by relatively precise legal provisions. In
this paper, we describe the characteristics of the German Employees'
Inventions Act (GEIA) and discuss which incentives it creates. We rely
on responses from a recent survey of 3350 German inventors to test
hypotheses regarding this institution. We conclude from our data that
the law creates substantial monetary rewards for productive inventors.
The qualitative responses from our survey confirm this view, but also
point to a number of dysfunctional effects. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All

N2  - This article describes an innovative data collection procedure. A
subsample (n = 164) of a longitudinal research project was assessed
using a bank-issued check survey procedure (a removable bank check on
which response fields were printed). Using the new procedure, parents
returned their surveys simply by depositing or cashing their incentive
checks at the bank. Evaluators found that using this format and minimal
follow-up achieved a response rate similar to sending a longer
questionnaire requiring intensive follow-up. A 75% return rate was
achieved after 8 weeks without the need of follow-up calls. A final
return rate of 89% was achieved after a second mailing and a single
round of phone calls. The procedure decreased labor costs by
approximately two thirds by reducing the need for a large volume of
reminder calls to parents. Implications for this unique survey method
are discussed, as well as the limitations of the procedure.

N2  - Certain survey characteristics proven to affect response rates, such as
a survey's length and topic, are often under limited control of the
researcher. Therefore, survey researchers sometimes seek to compensate
for such undesired effects on response rates by employing
countermeasures such as material or nonmaterial incentives. The scarce
evidence on those factors' effects in web survey contexts is far from
being conclusive. This study is aimed at filling this gap by examining
the effects of four factors along with selected interactions presumed to
affect response rates in web surveys. Requests to complete a web-based,
self-administered survey were sent to 2,152 owners of personal websites.
The 2 X 2 X 2 X 2 fully crossed factorial design encompassed the
experimental conditions of (a) high versus low topic salience, (b) short
versus long survey, (c) lottery incentive versus no incentive, and (d)
no feedback and general feedback (study results) versus personal
feedback (individual profile of results). As expected, highly salient
and shorter surveys yielded considerably higher unit-response rates.
Moreover, partial support was found for interaction hypotheses derived
from the leverage-salience theory of survey participation. Offering
personalized feedback compensated for the negative effects of low topic
salience on response rates. Also, the lottery incentive tended to evoke
more responses only if the survey was short (versus long), but this
interaction effect was only marginally significant. The results stress
the usefulness of a multifactorial approach encompassing interaction
effects to understand participation differences in web surveys.

cessation program as pail of a comprehensive health risk reduction
initiative in a large, geographically dispersed employee population.
Methods: A financial incentive for participation was offered during 2003
health benefits enrollment. The primary cessation outcome was 7-day
point prevalence abstinence at 12 months. Results: A total of 1776
employees used the Internet program. Among those surveyed, the response
rate was 32%. Quit rates ranged from 13% using intention to treat
analysis (nonresponders counted as smokers) to 43% among survey
responders. Higher Web site utilization was associated with better
cessation outcomes, even after controlling for baseline motivation.
Conclusions: The Internet program was successful at reaching a large
number of geographically dispersed employees. The range of quit rates
suggests that Internet cessation programs can be effective in promoting
cessation and preventing relapse in a worksite setting.

N2  - Purpose To measure satisfaction and motivation of community-based
preceptors, and to examine differences between degree groups of
physicians, pharmacists, advanced-practice nurses (nurse practitioners
and certified nurse midwives), and physician assistants.
Method In spring 2005, the authors mailed a four-page, 24-item survey to
all 2,061 community-based primary care preceptors served by the North
Carolina Area Health Education Centers system. The survey measured
preceptor satisfaction, likelihood of continuing as a preceptor,
influence of having students, motivation for teaching, satisfaction in
professional practice,satisfaction with incentives, and value of
incentives.
Results Response rate was 69.3%, or 1,428 preceptors. Most preceptors
(93.0%) reported high satisfaction with their precepting experience,
and 90.9% indicated high likelihood of continuing to precept for the
next five years. Almost all preceptors (93.7%) reported they were
satisfied with their professional life. Many community preceptors
(57.2%) were satisfied with incentives. They placed greater value on
the intrinsic reasons for precepting (i.e., enjoyment of teaching)
rather than extrinsic rewards (such as no-cost online library
resources). Degree groups placed differing values on intrinsic and
extrinsic rewards. Physicians reported more negativity about the
influence of students and regarding aspects of their professional lives.
Conclusions Tailoring support to better meet individual degree groups'
preferences can maximize resources and may encourage preceptor
retention. Special attention to physicians' needs may be warranted to
avoid decreased preceptor numbers in this at-risk group. Future studies
are needed to determine whether these findings are unique to North
Carolina, which has a strong infrastructure to support preceptors.

N2  - Given the paucity of objective information on neuromuscular electrical
stimulation approaches to dysphagia therapy, and the expanding
utilization of this clinical approach, we designed and conducted two
surveys to gather large-scale information regarding reported practice
patterns, outcomes, complications, and professional perceptions
associated with electrical stimulation approaches to dysphagia therapy.
Self-administered questionnaires were mailed to 1000 randomly selected
speech-language pathologists in each of two groups: (1) clinicians who
had completed a formal electrical stimulation training course and were
actively using these techniques, and (2) clinicians who were members of
Special Interest Division 13 of the American Speech-Language and Hearing
Association. Survey responses were anonymous and no incentive to respond
was included. Acceptable response rates were achieved for both surveys
(47% and 48%). Both groups of respondents were demographically similar
and reported similar practice patterns. Stroke Was the most common
etiology of dysphagia treated with this approach. The majority of
respondents identified no specific dysphagia criteria for application of
electrical stimulation, used varied behavioral treatment methods, and
did not follow patients beyond therapy. Clinicians reported positive
outcomes with no treatment-related complications. Satisfaction with this
approach was reported to be high among patients and professionals.
Clinicians who did not report using these techniques indicated that they
were waiting for more objective information on clinical outcomes and
safety. Results of these surveys form an initial description of practice
patterns and outcomes associated with electrical stimulation approaches
to dysphagia therapy.

adoption of chronic care guidelines in order entry systems and to
investigate the organizational and market-related factors associated
with this adoption.
Design: A quantitative nationwide survey of all primary care medical
groups in the United States with 20 or more physicians; data were
collected on 1,104 physician organizations, representing a 70% response
rate.
Measurements: Measurements were the presence of an asthma, diabetes, or
congestive heart failure guideline in a physician organization's order
entry system; size; age of the organization; number of clinic locations;
type of ownership; health maintenance organization market penetration;
urban/rural location; and presence of external incentives to improve
quality of care.
Results: Only 27% of organizations reported access to order entry with
decision support for chronic disease care. External incentives for
quality is the only factor significantly associated with adoption of
these tools. Organizations experiencing greater external incentives for
quality are more likely to adopt order entry with decision support.
Conclusion: Because external incentives are strong drivers of adoption,
policies requiring reporting of chronic care measurements and rewarding
improvement as well as financial incentives for use of specific
information technology tools are likely to accelerate adoption of order
entry with decision support.

Methods. We conducted a survey of a random national sample of 1,502
nursing home administrators; 724 responded. We analyzed frequency of
responses to questions regarding views of the quality measures and
actions taken.
Results. A model of nursing homes' behavior predicted that the report
card would provide an incentive for facilities to improve quality. A
majority of facilities (69%) reported reviewing their quality scores
regularly, and many have taken specific actions to improve quality.
Homes with poor quality scores were more likely to take actions
following the publication of the report card.
Discussion. These findings suggest that the Nursing Home Compare report

the Leapfrog Group's intensive care unit (ICU) physician staffing (IPS)
standard; compare adopters and committers with resisters relative to
perceived benefits, barriers and motivating factors; and examine
implementation strategies.
Materials and Methods: Chief medical officers (CMO) and ICU directors at
hospitals in 6 US regions were surveyed between August 2003 and January
2004. Hospital classifications were based on level of IPS implementation
pioneer (met before IPS), adopter (met after IPS by 2002 Leapfrog
survey), committer (not met but committed to December 2004
implementation), and resister (refused to adopt IPS). Meeting IPS
included intensivist staffing, 8 hours/day 7 days/week; sole patient
care in ICU; 95% pager response time <= 5 minutes; and physicians
certified in critical care.
Results: Forty-three (80%) CMOs and 42 (78%) ICU directors were
interviewed. Adopters (100%), committers (80%), and resisters (45%)
employed intensivists; 1 adopter (14%) met all criteria for standard.
Main motivators for implementation were ``quality of patient care{''}
for CMO (79%) and ICU director (71%) adopter/committers. Incentives to
implement were increasing intensivist authority (90% committers) and
intensivist salary support (80% committers and 70% adopters). Main
resister barriers were implementation costs (61% CMOs) and medical
staff controversy (55% ICU directors).
Conclusion: Most hospitals-including half of those who publicly resisted
the standard-made attempts to change physician staffing in their ICUs,
based on the criteria outlined by the Leapfrog Group. Major barriers
that need addressing are implementation costs and convincing hospital
organizations and medical staff regarding the benefits of adopting the
standard. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

us to fill gaps in the existing literature by estimating the hours as
well as the return-to-work response for younger as well as older
workers, based on objective rather than subjective self-reporting of
disability status. Our results suggest a strong positive incentive
effect from higher wages a and that lump-sum benefit payouts that are
not reduced if earnings increased generally do not have adverse
incentives on the return-to-work and hours decision, except for an
income effect over the longer life cycle of younger men. We also discuss
the policy implications of our estimates.

N2  - Background: As genetic testing becomes more common and increasingly
intertwined with medical care, the issues of genetic privacy and doctor
- patient confidentiality are being examined. Hereditary non- polyposis
colorectal cancer ( HNPCC) is a genetic predisposition to colorectal and
certain other cancers. Effective screening that can prevent colorectal
cancer is an important incentive for genetic testing.
Methods: A survey regarding the duty to warn family members of the risks
associated with an HNPCC- causing mutation was mailed to 227
participants in the Ontario Familial Colon Cancer Registry ( OFCCR). To
our knowledge, the opinions of patients on this subject have not been
reported previously in the literature. Responses were analysed
quantitatively using the SAS system and qualitatively by the review of
written comments.
Results: Completed surveys were returned by 105 participants, with a
response rate of 46.3%. The majority felt a personal responsibility to
warn relatives, but there was no significant agreement that doctors or
genetic counsellors should have a duty to warn relatives without a
patient's permission.
Conclusions: Patients undergoing genetic testing for HNPCC generally
understand that relatives could benefit from being informed of genetic
risk, but may not be willing or able to inform each family member.
Healthcare professionals should engage patients in a discussion of
familial implications before genetic testing. An agreement should be
formulated regarding which of the relatives should be informed. Patients
should be encouraged to personally disseminate the information, given
the unrealistic burden on practitioners to perform this task and
patients' preference for control over the information.

Nanaimo, CANADA, JUN 08-11, 2005
N2  - Background: Few studies have monitored physician supply in Canada, and
no studies have specifically examined the Canadian plastic surgery
workforce.
Methods: In this study, data were gathered by three methods. A survey
was distributed to all members of the Canadian Society of Plastic
Surgeons in October of 2004. Opinions on the availability of plastic
surgery services were solicited. A second survey that focused on
demographics and workload was distributed in December of 2004. Finally,
the locations of all Canadian trainees graduating between 1995 and 2005
were reviewed.
Results: The response rate to the first survey was 42 percent.
Seventy-eight percent of respondents felt that there was a shortage of
plastic surgeons in their community. The response rate to the second
survey was 40 percent. Twenty-eight percent of respondents were within 5
years of retirement and 3.2 percent stated that they planned to emigrate
by 2010. The mean waiting time for an elective consultation was 32 +/-
33 weeks. Review of all 179 plastic surgery graduates over the past 10
years revealed that 23 percent now practice outside of Canada.
Conclusions: When these results are projected to the total workforce,
they indicate that there will be a future shortage of plastic surgeons
in Canada. To prevent a further deficit, there is a need to increase the
number of plastic surgery trainees in Canada, to offer incentives for
graduates to stay in Canada, and to possibly recruit more
foreign-trained plastic surgeons to practice within Canada.

N2  - This study uses a split-sample, dichotomous choice contingent valuation
survey of 1574 U.S. residents to explore willingness to pay (WTP) for
renewable energy under collective and voluntary payment vehicles, and
under government and private provision of the good. We also evaluate the
impact of ``participation expectations{''} on stated WTP. We find some
evidence that, when confronted with a collective payment mechanism,
respondents state a somewhat higher WTP than when voluntary payment
mechanisms are used. Similarly, private provision of the good elicits a
somewhat higher WTP than does government provision. We also find that
contingent valuation responses are strongly correlated with expectations
for the WTP of others. Our results shed light on strategic response
behavior and the incentive compatibility of different CV designs, and
offer practical insight into U.S. household preferences for how to
support renewable energy. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

McFadden, D., 1998. Referendum contigent valuation, anchoring, and
willingness to pay for public goods. Resource and Energy Economics 20
(2), 85-116] show theoretically that stated preference questions about
public services can be framed in such ways that if the subjects accept
the frame the payoff-maximizing behavior will be to answer truthfully.
One key element of such a theoretically incentive-compatible framing is
that the (hypothetical) decision rule specified in the survey instrument
is understood to be a majority rule rather than the efficiency rule
typically used in cost-benefit analysis. We conducted field experiments
in Germany and Switzerland to test if a referendum framing as suggested
by Green et al. is effective in reducing strategic misrepresentation in
a contingent valuation setting. We did not find the expected effects of
the framing treatments on stated willingness to pay or on individuals'
(stated) beliefs about the social choice context. The results do not
support hopes that a theoretically incentive compatible framing could be
purposefully used to invoke the specific beliefs about the linkage
between responses and policy implementation that would make stated
preference questions incentive compatible. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All

reexamine the viability of allo wing a market for cadaveric kidneys and
estimate the implied equilibrium price based on our survey responses. In
sharp contrast to the findings of Kaserman and Barnett, we estimate that
a market equilibrium price for cadaveric kidneys may be prohibitively
high. Consequently, we support other policy alternatives to increase
supply, particularly presumed consent and mandated choice. Our findings
also highlight the importance of obtaining data through experiments,
rather than a survey, to estimate the impact of financial incentives.

N2  - This study employs a novel statistical strategy to examine the
determinants of turnover intention in government service. To
appropriately measure a main determinant of turnover
intention-functional preferences-I estimate an ordinal item response
model using data from the Federal Human Capital Survey. The sample is
selected to facilitate an important comparison: the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) has undergone significant performance-based pay reforms
for supervisors, but not for nonsupervisors, whereas the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), also a subunit of the U.S. Treasury,
has not. Inferential models of turnover intention reveal among other
things that functional and friendship solidary preferences are important
determinants of turnover intention, but increased accountability is
associated with greater turnover among subordinates. IRS supervisors,
who face paybanding, are significantly less likely to consider leaving
than their counterparts in the OCC, who do not face such incentives.

N2  - Two studies were conducted to assess the extent to which prepaid
monetary incentives increase response rates to company-sponsored
employee surveys. The first study indicated that providing a prepaid
monetary incentive to a randomly selected group of employees from among
a sample of 7,268 employees increased response rates from 31.7% to
43.5%. A second study based on 4,925 employees from another company
replicated this finding and tested for effects of novelty and incentive
size. Although response rates in the second study were significantly
higher for employees who received an incentive (24.9%) compared with
those who did not receive an incentive (20.8%), no significant effects
were found for novelty or incentive size. The implications for using
incentives to increase response rates in company-based surveys are

was the much higher response rate due to the use of priority mail and an
incentive payment of $5 versus priority mail only or first-class mail
only. Letters of support from the major meat and poultry trade
associations and the up to five contacts of potential survey respondents
by the surveying organization also appear to have improved the response
rate. Overall, the survey methodology yielded nearly 1,000 responses
from 1,705 possible meat and poultry plants on their costs of compliance
with the Pathogen Reduction /Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point rule
of 1996, plant characteristics, and use of food safety technologies and

N2  - Background and Objectives: One factor cited for the decline of family
physicians delivering babies is a lack of faculty role models during
residency training. This study's purpose was to determine how many
residency programs experience difficulty recruiting faculty who perform
deliveries and whether financial or not financial compensation are
associated with recruiting difficulties. Methods: Using an electronic
questionnaire, we surveyed program directors of nonmilitary family
medicine residencies in the United States, with a response rate of
60.7%. Results: Among residency programs who tried to recruit faculty
with delivery skills, 58% stated that they have difficulties. Two
program characteristics were associated with recruitment difficulties:
the number of delivery providers among faculty and whether the residency
program directors included delivery in their own practices. There were
no statistically significant associations between recruiting
difficulties and any type of financial reimbursement methods, but
nonfinancial incentives were offered more often by programs that had no
difficulty recruiting. Conclusions: More than half of all family
medicine residency programs have difficulty recruiting faculty members
to provide delivery training. Changing the type of financial
compensation for faculty providing maternity care is not likely to
assist in recruiting. However, we did find that programs without
recruiting difficulties were more likely to offer nonfinancial
incentives to faculty members who perform deliveries.

Singapore that assessed the values of two types of privacy assurance:
privacy statements and privacy seals. We collaborated with a local firm
to host the experiment on its website with its real domain name, and the
subjects were not informed of the experiment. Hence, the study provided
afield observation of the subjects' behavioral responses toward privacy
assurances. We found that (1) the existence of a privacy statement
induced more subjects to disclose their personal information but that of
a privacy seal did not; (2) monetary incentive had a positive influence
on disclosure; and (3) information request had a negative influence on
disclosure. These results were robust in other specifications that used
alternative measures for some of our model variables. We discuss this

N1  - 133rd Annual Meeting of the American-Public-Health-Association,
Philadelphia, PA, DEC 10-14, 2005
N2  - Background: In the past decade, health insurers have increased their
reliance on cost control policies such as prior authorization and 3-tier
formularies. Little is known about how these policies are being applied
to psychotropic medications, many of which have low rates of patient
adherence.
Objective: This study reports on plans' cost-sharing tier placement and
authorization policies for 12 brand-only psychotropic medications in 3
classes: antidepressants, antipsychotics, and medications for
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
Methods: Data were from a nationally representative survey of private
health plans regarding mental health and substance-abuse services in
2003; 368 plans responded (83% response rate). Results were weighted
and represent national estimates of health-plan characteristics.
Results: The majority of insurance products provided unrestricted
placement on Tier 2 (medium co-payment) for at least 2 brand-only
antidepressants and at least 2 brand-only antipsychotics. This approach
allows clinicians some limited leeway in initial medication selection.
However, most patients who did not respond to the Tier-2 options
typically faced a substantial escalation in copayment (Tier 3), possibly
leading to premature medication discontinuation. For ADHD, the options
were considerably more limited, with 22.1% of products applying some
restriction to all 3 medications and only 15.9% of products leaving all
3 medications unrestricted. Plans with specialty contracts for mental
health were considerably more likely to use Tier 3 (highest copayment)
as their only restriction approach.
Conclusions: Based on the results of this analysis, private plans were
managing psychotropic costs using copayment incentives rather than
administrative controls. This approach was less intrusive for
clinicians, but resulting higher copayments could worsen already high
rates of nonadherence; future research should examine this issue.

N2  - Objective: This study evaluated the perceptions of research, frequency
of use of research findings in practice, and the level of research
skills of chiropractors and massage therapists in Canada. Predictors of
application of research findings in clinical practice were also
explored.
Methods: A survey was mailed to members of the College of Chiropractors
of Alberta (n = 833) and the Massage Therapist Association of Alberta (n
650). Univariate and logistic regression analysis were conducted with
SPSS and Stata.
Results: A total of 483 questionnaires were returned (response rate,
32.6%). Chiropractors and massage therapists reported an overall
positive perception toward research, acknowledging the importance of
research to validate their practice. Although both groups felt
comfortable using the library, they had little confidence in their
research skills and overall application of research in practice was
limited. Significant differences were found between the 2 professional
groups, with chiropractors reporting more research skills and
evidence-based practice. Primary discipline, frequent referral to
peer-reviewed journals, and strong agreement with the statement that
``research adds credibility to my discipline{''} were predictors of
research application in practice.
Conclusion: It appears that in Canada neither chiropractors nor massage
therapists consistently apply research in practice, which may result
from a lack of research education and research skills. The differences
between the 2 professional groups may be attributed to the chiropractic
profession's relatively more research-focused professional training.
Strategies to encourage greater research uptake and evidence-based
behavior by practitioners include professional association incentives,
Such as education credits or practitioner cooperatives that would
provide time and support for research.

N2  - Background: Often in survey research, subsets of the population invited
to complete the survey do not respond in a timely manner and valuable
resources are expended in recontact efforts. Various methods of
improving response have been offered, such as reducing questionnaire
length, offering incentives, and utilizing reminders; however, these
methods can be costly. Utilizing characteristics of early responders
(refusal or consent) in enrollment and recontact efforts may be a unique
and cost-effective approach for improving the quality of epidemiologic
research.
Methods: To better understand early responders of any kind, we compared
the characteristics of individuals who explicitly refused, consented, or
did not respond within 2 months from the start of enrollment into a
large cohort study of US military personnel. A multivariate
polychotomous logistic regression model was used to estimate the effect
of each covariate on the odds of early refusal and on the odds of early
consent versus late/non-response, while simultaneously adjusting for all
other variables in the model.
Results: From regression analyses, we found many similarities between
early refusers and early consenters. Factors associated with both early
refusal and early consent included older age, higher education, White
race/ethnicity, Reserve/Guard affiliation, and certain information
technology and support occupations.
Conclusion: These data suggest that early refusers may differ from
late/non-responders, and that certain characteristics are associated
with both early refusal and early consent to participate. Structured
recruitment efforts that utilize these differences may achieve early
response, thereby reducing mail costs and the use of valuable resources
in subsequent contact efforts.

N2  - INTERNATIONALIZATION OF TRADE HAS extended to services and intangibles
such as research and experimental development (R&D). The emergence of
knowledge economies with porous borders raises questions concerning the
preparedness of countries to manage their systems of innovation in
response to these changes. This article draws on the recently completed
2004/5 R&D survey, and other local and international data sources to
consider the extent to which South African R&D is positioned to respond
to the challenge of the internationalization of R&D. This entails
looking at the behaviour of the main role players in the system of
innovation, the extent to which they are open to local and global
interactions, competitive advantage, and the implications for policy.
The evidence suggests that, from an R&D perspective, the emerging South
African knowledge economy is still more `closed' than `open'. Actions
that may contribute to attracting international R&D investment and
collaboration include development of skilled people and the further
enhancement of direct and indirect R&D incentives.

N2  - Monetary incentives are increasingly used to help motivate survey
participation. This article summarizes several theories underlying the
use of incentives and briefly reviews research demonstrating their
intended and unintended effects on response rates, sample composition,
response bias, and response quality. It also considers the evidence for
the effectiveness of incentives in reducing nonresponse bias.
Institutional review boards have begun to ask whether, and under what
conditions, the use of monetary incentives to induce participation might
be coercive and to question the use of such incentives in surveys of
``vulnerable{''} populations, including surveys of injury and violence.
The article reviews the ethical principles underlying the requirement
for voluntary informed consent as well as current regulations and a
broad theoretical and empirical literature bearing on this question,
concluding that incentives are never coercive. The question of whether
they exert ``undue influence{''} in a specific situation is more
difficult, but it may be the wrong question to ask. The article
concludes with several recommendations designed to ensure the ethical
use of incentives in surveys on violence and injury.

N2  - Background: Relationships between aberrant social functioning and
depression have been explored via behavioral, clinical, and survey
methodologies, highlighting their importance in the etiology of
depression. The neural underpinnings of these relationships, however,
have not been explored.
Methods. Nine depressed participants and 14 never-depressed control
subjects viewed emotional and neutral pictures at two functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning sessions approximately 22
weeks apart. In the interim, depressed patients received the
antidepressant Venlafaxine. Positively rated images were parsed into
three separate comparisons: social interaction, human faces, and sexual
images; across scanning session, activation to these images was compared
with other positively rated images.
Results. For each of the three social stimulus types (social
interaction, faces, sexual images), a distinguishable circuitry was
activated equally in non-depressed control subjects and post-treatment
depressed subjects but showed a hypo-response in the depressed group
pre-treatment. These structures include regions of prefrontal, temporal,
and parietal cortices, insula, basal ganglia, and the hippocampus.
Conclusions: The neural hypo-response to positively valenced social
stimuli that is observed in depression remits as response to
antidepressant medication occurs, suggesting a state-dependent
deficiency in response to positive social incentives, These findings
underscore the importance of addressing social dysfunction in research
and treatment of depression.

N2  - In response to substantial economic and social dislocations in the
United States, many rangeland owners are changing land use and
management practices. Changes in land use can significantly affect the
services rangeland ecosystems provide. Decisions associated with such
changes are likely mediated by landowner views regarding individual
rights, social responsibilities, and the future security of property
rights. In this paper, we examine the extent to which landowners are
likely to adopt, without public compensation, socially desirable land
management objectives that enhance ecosystem services from rangelands.
The study consisted of a mail survey of landowners with at least 40 ha:
500 in Texas, 500 in Utah, and 694 in Colorado. Adjusted response rates
were 62% in Texas, 46% in Utah, and 51% in Colorado. Regression
analyses showed that willingness to adopt socially desirable rangeland
management objectives was positively correlated with the social
responsibility dimension of respondents' property rights orientations
but negatively correlated with the rights erosion dimension. Our results
also suggested that landowners in private land states, such as Texas,
might be less willing than landowners in states with more public land to
manage their land for the maintenance of ecosystem services without
being compensated. Although the scope of our study was limited, the
results suggest that agencies tasked with maintaining ecosystem services
on private rangelands might more successfully achieve their mission by
promoting social responsibility among landowners. Including community
leaders with a highly developed sense of social responsibility in
programs aimed at improving land stewardship and including peer-pressure
incentives in such programs might enhance social responsibility
perspectives among landowners. Such programs should also be adaptable at
the state-level to account for differences in property-rights
orientations relative to landowner dependence on private and public
land.

N2  - Agricultural policy has in the last 50 years taken much of the risk and
the initiative away from Norwegian farm forest owners. Subsidies in
agriculture have guaranteed an acceptable income and there has been
neither need nor incentives for starting up new activities at the farms.
This situation is now gradually changing. The income both from
agriculture and forestry is decreasing and farm forest owners have
either to move, to find job opportunities outside the farm or to start
up new activity at the farm using the farm's resources. Entrepreneurship
theory is used to study the question why some farm forest owners choose
to start up some new activity based on the forest resources they have.
We identify two main elements of entrepreneurship; the ability to
recognise business opportunities and the ability to take calculated
risk. In a survey to 500 forest owners in southern Norway (response rate
45%), we included questions about opportunity recognition and risk
aversion. From the answers, we were able to split the forest owners in
two groups, those with entrepreneurial attitudes and those without.
Using logistic regression we found a significantly higher probability
for start-up of new activities in the group with entrepreneurial
attitudes. This result has very interesting policy implications. Many
studies show that entrepreneurial attitudes to a large degree can be
learnt. The first way of learning about entrepreneurship is through the
education system and through courses and training of forest owners. The
other way is `learning by doing', which is most probably the most
efficient way to learn about entrepreneurship. Public policy should
stimulate more owners to `do', by that they will `learn' and that will
again lead to more entrepreneurial activities at the holdings. (c) 2005

N2  - To develop an instrument for assessing physician attitudes toward
quality incentive programs, and to assess its reliability and validity.
Study involved primary data collection. A 40-item paper and pencil
survey of primary care physicians in Rochester, New York, and
Massachusetts was conducted between May 2004 and December 2004.
Seven-hundred and ninety-eight completed questionnaires were received,
representing a response rate of 32 percent (798/2,497).
Based on an extensive review of the literature and discussions with
experts in the field, we developed a conceptual framework representing
the features of pay-for-performance (P4P) programs hypothesized to
affect physician behavior in that context. A draft questionnaire was
developed based on that conceptual model and pilot tested in three
groups of physicians. The questionnaire was modified based on the
physician feedback, and the revised version was distributed to 2,497
primary care physicians affiliated with two of the seven sites
participating in Rewarding Results, a national evaluation of quality
target and financial incentive programs.
Respondents were randomly divided into a derivation and a validation
sample. Exploratory factor analysis was applied to the responses of the
derivation sample. Those results were used to create scales in the
validation sample, and these were then subjected to multitrait analysis
(MTA). One scale representing physicians' perception of the impact of
P4P on their clinical practice was regressed on the other scales as a
test of construct validity.
Seven constructs were identified and demonstrated substantial convergent
and discriminant validity in the MTA: awareness and understanding,
clinical relevance, cooperation, unintended consequences, control,
financial salience, and impact. Internal consistency reliabilities
(Cronbach's alpha coefficients) ranged from 0.50 to 0.80. A
statistically significant 25 percent of the variation in perceived
impact was accounted for by physician perceptions of the other six
characteristics of P4P programs.
It is possible to identify and measure the key salient features of P4P
programs using a valid and reliable 26-item survey. This instrument may
now be used in further studies to better understand the impact of P4P
programs on physician behavior.

tackles the questions of whether it is worth using monetary incentives
and the size of the inducement by testing a logit model of the impact of
prepaid monetary incentives on response rates in consumer and
organizational mail surveys. The results support their use and show that
the inducement value makes a significant impact on the effect size.
Importantly, no significant differences were found between consumer and
organizational populations. A cost-benefit model is developed to
estimate the optimum incentive when attempting to minimize overall
survey costs for a given sample size.

N2  - Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) has consistently been found
to afflict one in twenty pregnant women and is therefore considered a
leading cause of physical injury, mental illness and adverse pregnancy
outcome. A general antenatal screening policy has been advocated, though
compliance with such guidelines tends to be low. We therefore attempted
to identify potential barriers to IPV screening in a context where no
guidelines have been instigated yet.
Methods: Questionnaire-based Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice survey
among obstetrician-gynaecologists in Flanders, Belgium (n = 478).
Results: The response rate was 52.1% (249/478). Gynaecologists prove
rather unfamiliar with IPV and therefore largely underestimate the
extent of the problem. Merely 6.8% (17/249) of the respondents ever
received or pursued any kind of education on IPV. Accordingly they do
feel insufficiently skilled to deal with IPV, yet sufficiently capable
of recognizing IPV among their patients. Survey participants largely
refute the incentive of universal screening in favour of opportunistic
screening and do not consider pregnancy as a window of opportunity for
routine screening. They do consider screening for IPV as an issue of
medical liability and therefore do not suffer from a lack of motivation
to screen. In addition, obstetrician-gynaecologists do believe that
screening for IPV may be an effective means to counteract abusive
behaviours. Yet, their outcome expectancy is weighed down by their
perceived lack of self-efficacy in dealing with IPV, by lack of
familiarity with referral procedures and by their perceived lack of
available referral services. Major external or patient-related barriers
to IPV screening included a perceived lack of time and fear of offending
or insulting patients. Overall, merely 8.4% (21/245) of gynaecologists
in this survey performed some kind of IPV questioning on a regular
basis. Finally, physician education was found to be the strongest
predictor of a positive attitude towards screening and of current
screening practices.
Conclusion: Endorsement of physician training on IPV is an important
first step towards successful implementation of screening guidelines for
IPV. Additional introduction of enabling and reinforcement strategies
such as screening tools, patient leaflets, formal referral pathways, and
physician feedback may further enhance compliance with screening
recommendations and guidelines.

N2  - Will changing the Dutch electoral system to give MPs a stronger personal
mandate affect parliamentary group unity in the Dutch parliament? To
discuss this question, we first describe Parliamentary Party Group (PPG)
unity in the Dutch Tweede Kamer. Placing the Dutch case in perspective,
we find that group unity is comparatively high. Surveying next the
analytical literature to establish the relative merits of sociological,
institutional and electoral system variables, we find the impact of
intra-parliamentary factors to be strong. Institutional incentives to
stay united in political struggles weigh heavily when explaining why
most West European parliaments score high on PPG unity, regardless of
electoral systems in general and preferential voting arrangements in
particular. We also stress the likely strategic party responses to
electoral change, for example, by revising candidate selection
procedures to reduce the possibilities of unwanted NIP independence in
parliaments. A stronger personal mandate may, nevertheless, give a
moderate rise in the numerous ways in which MPs can communicate their
personal qualities and party independence to their voters.

N2  - Objectives: Physicians may be aware of at least 2 types of costs when
prescribing: patient's out-of-pocket costs and the actual costs of the
medication. We evaluated physicians' perceptions, about relevant costs
for prescription drugs and the importance of communication about these
costs.
Study Design: Mailed survey to a random sample of 1200 physician members
of the California Medical Association, and a phone survey of a sample of
nonresponders.
Methods: Descriptive statistics of survey items, McNemar's test to
compare survey item responses, and logistic regression to evaluate the
relationship between physician, practice, and system variables and
physicians' perceptions of relevant medication costs.
Results: Of respondents with correct addresses, 49.6% responded to the
survey; 13% of nonresponders were contacted by phone. Approximately
91% and 80% of physicians reported that it is important to manage
patients' out-of-pocket costs and total medication costs, respectively.
When comparing the relative importance of managing the 2 types of costs,
59% of physicians agreed that managing patients' out-of-pocket costs
was more important than managing the total medication costs and only
16% disagreed. Physicians believed it was more important to discuss
out-of-pocket costs than total costs with patients (P < .0001), but only
15% of physicians reported discussing out-of-pocket costs frequently
and 5% reported talking about total medication costs frequently.
Physicians who managed more Medicare patients had a greater likelihood
than physicians managing fewer Medicare patients of prioritizing
out-of-pocket cost rather than total cost management (P = .038), and
generalists had a greater likelihood than medical subspecialists (P =
.046).
Conclusions: Physicians prioritize managing out-of-pocket costs over
total medication costs. Pharmacy benefit designs that use patient
out-of-pocket cost incentives to influence utilization are addressing
the costs to which physicians may be most responsive. When physicians
face conflicts between managing patients' out-of-pocket costs and total
costs, they will likely try to protect the patients' resources at the
expense of the insurer or society. Efforts to align patients',
insurers', and societies' incentives will simplify prescribing decisions
and result in better value in prescribing.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Most insurers in the US have implemented incentive-based
formularies that rely on out-of-pocket costs to influence prescription
drug utilization. Medicare Part D plans have broadly adopted such
benefit designs.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate physicians' perceptions of their knowledge of
formularies and out-of-pocket costs, factors that influence knowledge of
costs, physicians' perceived responsibility for helping patients manage
their out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs, and physicians'
perceptions of the role of pharmacists in managing these costs.
METHODS: A multiple-choice survey was mailed to a random sample of 1200
physician members of the California Medical Association; a phone survey
of nonresponders was then conducted.
RESULTS: Of 1027 surveys delivered to correct addresses, 509 (49.6%)
responses were received. Thirty-three percent of physicians reported
that they were usually or always aware of patients' formularies and 20%
were usually or always aware of patients' out-of-pocket costs for
medications. Surgeons, emergency department physicians, and physicians
that prescribe from more formularies than other physicians are less
likely to be aware of patients' out-of-pocket costs, while physicians in
large practices and those who use computers to prescribe are more aware.
While 91% of physicians agreed that it is important that patients'
out-of-pocket costs be managed, 40% somewhat or strongly agreed that it
is their responsibility to help. Sixty-five percent of physicians
believed that it is the responsibility of the pharmacist to be familiar
with patients' out-of-pocket costs.
CONCLUSIONS: Physicians often lack the knowledge to assist patients in
the management of their out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs and
they depend on pharmacists to help patients manage those costs. Computer
order entry and resources available in large physician organizations
improve physicians' awareness of out-of-pocket costs when prescribing.

N2  - Purpose: Healthcare organizations have undergone major change efforts in
the past decade. Sustained change is related to continued alignment
among organizational participants and may fail with incongruent
perceptions of change. This study identifies factors contributing to the
alignment in perceptions of organizational change outcomes between
executives and all other employees.
Methodology: The sample included 10 hospitals with survey responses from
421 executives and other employees. Using hierarchical linear modeling
(HLM), perceptual alignment was modeled at the first level as a function
of goal commitment, goal clarity, goal acceptance, goal specificity,
staff participation, available skill set, and knowledge and at the
second level as organizational size.
Findings: Descriptive statistics showed employee perception of outcomes
differed among personnel levels. HLM results showed that goal
specificity, appropriate staff training, reward incentives, effective
communication, information sharing, and organization's ability to
sustain changes induced perceptual alignment in change outcomes. Staff
involvement in designing change efforts increased perceptual
misalignment, whereas involvement during implementation and maintenance
phases increased alignment.
Research Limitations: This research uses cross-sectional data from 10
hospitals. Data were gathered from surveys that may have recall bias as
hospitals were surveyed at different times after the implementation of
their restructuring.
Practical Implications: Our findings enhance the understanding of
processes and mechanisms that enable healthcare organizations to align
organizational participants' efforts during change. Results suggest that
decision-makers should create incentives to encourage innovative
practices, institute effective communication mechanisms, selectively
disseminate information, and involve participants in implementing and
maintaining changes to achieve intended outcomes.
Originality/Value of Article: This article provides unique insight into
the importance and causes of organizational alignment after major
restructuring. Too often, organizations' change efforts fail after
implementation. Effective change requires continued effort and alignment
to embed the desired changes.

N2  - To comprehend how the welfare state adjusts to economic shocks it is
important to get a handle on both the genesis of popular preferences and
the institutional incentives for governments to respond to these
preferences. This paper attempts to do both, using a general theoretical
framework and detailed data at both the individual and national levels.
In a first step, we focus on how risk exposure and income are related to
preferences for redistribution. To test our hypotheses, we extract
detailed risk-exposure measures from labour-force surveys and marry them
to cross-national opinion survey data. Results from analysis of these
data attest to the great importance of risks within the labour market in
shaping popular preferences for redistributive efforts by governments.
In a second step, we turn our attention to the supply side of government
redistribution. Institutions, we argue, mediate governments' reactions
to redistributional demands following economic shocks. Using time-series
cross-country data, we demonstrate how national training systems, and
electoral institutions, as well as partisanship, shape government
responses.

N2  - hi this article, the authors discuss the results of an experiment
embedded hi the Dutch Family and Fertility Survey for Young Moroccans
and Turks. The effects of two factors on response rates and data quality
are investigated. The first factor is a promised incentive versus no
incentive. In the second factor, the part of the questionnaire with
presumed sensitive questions is administered via computer-assisted
self-interviewing (CASI), instead of completely administering the
questionnaire via computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI). No
significant main effect of the promised incentive on the response rates
could be found. There are, however; interactions between the incentive,
gender, and ethnicity, which show that different subpopulations react
differently to the promised incentive. Furthermore, there is no evidence
that the data collected by means of CASI results in more valid answers.
Still, when the data are collected by means of CASI a substantial
increase in the rate of ``don't know{''} responses is observed.

N2  - OBJECTIVE. On December 13, 2002, Pediarix, a combination vaccine that
contains diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis; hepatitis B; and
inactivated polio vaccines, was licensed by the Food and Drug
Administration for use in the primary immunization series. Use of this
vaccine decreases the number of injections that children receive when
completing their primary immunization series at the 2-, 4-, and 6-month
well-child visits. The objective of this study was to determine the
factors that influence the use of this combined vaccine in private
pediatric practices, with particular attention to the perceived economic
impact of Pediarix and actions taken to address this impact within the
private pediatric setting.
METHODS. A mail survey study was conducted of a random sample of 565
practicing pediatricians that was obtained from the American Medical
Association Masterfile. Frequency distributions were developed for all
responses, and the vaccine financing policies of the state of practice
for each respondent were determined. chi(2) analysis was performed to
assess any associations of the predictor variables with the outcome
variables of interest, use or consideration of use of the Pediarix
vaccine. Logistic regression was used to determine the independent
association of the predictor variables with use or consideration of use
of Pediarix. Regression models that did and did not include practice
ownership as a predictor variable were developed.
RESULTS. Response rate was 63%(N = 355). A total of 39% (n = 123) of
the respondents' practices were purchasing Pediarix for use with their
private patients. An additional 18% (n = 55) were considering
purchasing the vaccine. Those who were in practices that were owned by
hospitals or health systems were more likely than those who were in solo
or group practices to purchase Pediarix for their private patients.
Approximately half of the remaining respondents order Pediarix through
their state immunization program. Among the 52% of respondents who did
not, 23% reported that the vaccine was not yet available through their
state program, and 47% stated that they did not want to use different
vaccines for their public and private patients. Only 11% believed that
Pediarix was not compatible with their other vaccine products.
Physicians that currently were purchasing or considering purchasing
Pediarix were more likely to be influenced by both parental and provider
desire to decrease the number of injections at a single visit and the
reduced time for immunization delivery. Fewer than 1% of respondents
reported either having experienced or expecting to experience a
significant decrease in practice revenue as a result of the use of
Pediarix.
CONCLUSIONS. Although use of the vaccine results in fewer administration
fees for most physicians, the magnitude of the change seemed not to be
significant for the majority of respondents or was outweighed by other
factors. It also is possible that larger practices or buying
cooperatives were able to negotiate discounted rates for Pediarix
relative to the constituent products. This may have been a strategy of
manufacturers and/or distributors to provide incentive for practices to
switch to the combination product. Of note was the appreciation of
respondents for the preferences of patients for fewer vaccines and, to a
lesser degree, for the decrease in office staff time required to provide
vaccination with multiple antigens when using Pediarix. Also, the role
of the availability of a given vaccine through the Vaccines for Children
program is important in its adoption into practice.

448 physicians solicited a total of 5,371 eligible patients (12.0 per
physician), among which 3,763 patients (8.4 per physician) agreed to
participate. One-fifth (22.3%) of the physicians were able to obtain IC
from 100% of the patients they solicited. Physicians who thought that
the information on the IC sheet was sufficient to obtain consent (odds
ratio {[}OR]=2.0, 95% confidence interval {[}Cl]=1.1-3.9; p=0.03) and
those who did not consider that the patient's decision was influenced by
relatives and friends (OR=0.2, C1=0.1-0.4; p=0.001), were significantly
more likely to obtain IC from 100% of the eligible patients.
Three-fourths (73.2%) of the physicians targeted only patients who they
perceived would easily provide IC, and 81.2% favored some form of
incentives for patients. The results of this study should be useful for
efficiently implementing randomized controlled trials in Japan.

N2  - It has been argued that the traditional regulatory approach of the
Endangered Species Act, based on land-use restrictions, has failed to
protect endangered species on private land. In response, there has been
a call for the use of incentives to complement this regulatory approach.
This paper examines the potential of incentives programs to elicit
conservation-oriented management choices from landowners. Data obtained
from a survey of non-industrial private forest owners in Oregon and
Washington is used to examine the effectiveness of various incentives.
The results indicate that incentives, in particular compensation and
assurances, can be effective in increasing the conservation effort
provided by landowners. The results also suggest that conservation
policy for private lands could be improved by relying on a combination
of incentives, including financial incentives and assurances, rather
than exclusively on the threat of regulation. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V..

residents' addresses. County ``F{''} respondents (n = 541) which were
57% female and 95% Euro-American having a mean age of 47.3 yr.

using the $2 incentive and 73% using the $5 incentive. These were not
significantly different by chi-square test. The more cost-effective
incentive for increasing the response rate of adults in this rural
midwestern sample was to code the envelopes and use a $2.00 rather than
$5.00 incentive, a cost per returned survey of $5.24 versus $9.13,
respectively. The findings support Dillman's principle of diminishing
returns as the size of the incentive goes up.

Emergency Medicine (SAEM) of emergency medicine faculty salaries,
benefits, work hours, and department demographics for all programs
accredited by the Residency Review Committee for Emergency Medicine
(RRC-EM).
Methods: Data represent compensation paid for the 2004-2005 academic
year. Responses were collected by SAEM, and blinded program and
individual faculty data were entered into a customized version of a
relational database program with a built-in statistical package. Salary
data were sorted by criteria such as program region, faculty title,
American Board of Emergency Medicine certification, academic rank, years
since completing residency, program size, and whether data were reported
to the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC). Demographic data
were analyzed with regard to numerous criteria including department
staffing levels, emergency department (ED) volumes, ED length of stay,
department income sources, salary incentive components, research
funding, and specific type and value of fringe benefits offered. Data
were compared with previous SAEM studies.
Results: Sixty-one of 132 (46%) accredited programs responded, yielding
data on 1,213 full-time faculty from all four AAMC regions. Mean
salaries were reported as follows: all faculty, $189,848; first-year
faculty, $153,855; programs reporting data to AAMC, $183,605; programs
not reporting data to AAMC, $204,383; core faculty, $197,259; and
noncore faculty, $164,215. Mean salaries as reported by AAMC region
were as follows: Northeast, $192,864; South, $182,768; Midwest,
$192,224; and West, $195,732. Full-time emergency medicine residency
program faculty are reported to be working an average of 1,032 total
clinical hours per year. Workweeks average 22 clinical hours per week
and 22 nonclinical hours per week, with 5.1 weeks of time off per year.
Conclusions: Reported salaries for full-time emergency medicine
residency faculty continue to rise overall but fell for the first time
in one region (the Midwest). Academic rank continues to correlate
directly with salary. Fellowship training continues to show a negative
correlation with salary. Significant regional differences in salaries
have been present in all six SAEM surveys.

care at Veterans Health Administration facilities.
Methods. Key informants at 18 sites completed a brief checklist survey
adapted from national smoking cessation guidelines. Responses were
compared with detailed, site surveys.
Results. Guideline adherence was seen in identifying smokers and
treating inpatient smokers. Areas of low adherence include offering
incentives and defining staff responsibilities. The checklist survey
showed poor correspondence with the detailed survey with low agreement
on systematic screening (kappa = .21) and higher agreement on primary
care prescribing authority (kappa = .53).
Discussion. This pilot survey provides a potential rapid method for
assessing adherence to systems recommendations from the national smoking
cessation guidelines. The relatively low agreement with a more detailed.
survey suggests that the two surveys may have been. measuring different
aspects of smoking cessation care.

N2  - Inspired by the positive effects of incentives on mail survey response
rates, researchers have started using incentives to increase response
rates to Web surveys. The established best practice of presending cash
incentives is difficult to implement in Web surveys, and studies suggest
that its presumed effects might not be witnessed in Web surveys. In
contrast, several studies have found that lotteries can significantly
increase Web survey response rates. Some authors have argued that this
could reflect the fact that Internet users have come to expect Web
surveys to be associated with lotteries. An experimental study among
university students found that the lottery influences the Web survey
response rates, but there are indications that different subgroups might
be more influenced by this incentive than others. The observed
differences are interpreted along the lines of possible differences ill
the degree to which different respondent groups expect incentives in
return for their participation.

N2  - In Sweden decentralised drug-budgets at health-care facility levels were
introduced in 1997 in an attempt to contain increasing pharmaceutical
expenditures. This paper reports the findings of a postal survey which
investigates whether decentralised drug-budgets according to a so-called
primary-care based model in Swedish health care have led to increased
cost awareness and changed attitudes towards cost-minimisation and
cost-effectiveness as decision-making criteria among physicians. In
particular, it was investigated whether there were differences in this
respect between general practitioners (GPs) and specialists. The postal
survey was sent to 1520 Swedish physicians from a stratified sample of
Swedish county councils. A total of 738 physicians responded (response
rate 49%). Statistical analysis was performed of logistic regression
analysis and independent or paired samples t-tests. The results suggest
that GPs have a higher degree of cost awareness than specialists.
Physicians with experience of decentralised drug-budgets have a higher
degree of cost awareness than other physicians. However, the rating of
the top four decision-making criteria; therapeutic effects, side
effects, compliance and cost-effectiveness, were not significantly
different when comparing GPs against specialists, and physicians
practising in county councils with decentralised drug-budgets against
other physicians. The main barriers to considering costs to a greater
extent were perceived difficulties in switching drugs and a fear among
physicians of losing credibility among patients. In conclusion,
decentralisation of drug-budgets according to the Swedish primary-care
based model increases cost awareness, especially among GPs. Such
responsibility, however, does not create strong incentives for
physicians to reconsider the importance of cost-effectiveness in
relation to other decision-making criteria when prescribing. Parallel
interventions are needed to meet the objective of cost-effective
prescribing. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - A national sample of pediatricians was surveyed to evaluate preschool
vision screening practices (response rate 55%, 377 of 690 eligible
respondents). The rate of acuity screening for 3-year-old children was
low (35%), but increased for 4- (73%) and 5-year-old children (66%).
Few used photoscreening or auto refraction (8%). Common barriers were
that screening Is too time-consuming and children are uncooperative.
Half reported that there should be separate reimbursement for vision
screening. Financial incentives may be important for ensuring the
delivery of preschool vision screening, as well as adoption of emerging
screening technologies if such devices are shown to be effective.

N2  - Incentive-based formularies have been widely instituted to control the
rising costs of prescription drugs. To work properly, such formularies
depend on patients to be aware of financial incentives and communicate
their cost preferences with prescribing physicians. The impact of
financial incentives on patient awareness of and communication about
those costs is unknown.
To evaluate the relationship between enrollment in incentive-based
pharmacy benefit plans and awareness of out-of-pocket costs and rates of
communication about out-of-pocket costs.
A matched telephone survey of patients and their primary care
physicians.
Los Angeles County.
One thousand nine hundred and seventeen patients aged 53 to 82 (73%
response rate).
Patient-reported pharmacy benefit design, knowledge of out-of-pocket
costs, and discussion of out-of-pocket costs with physicians.
Sixty-two percent of patients who had prescription drug coverage and
were aware of their pharmacy benefit design reported being enrolled in
incentive-based plans. The majority of these (54%) were ``never{''} or
only ``sometimes{''} aware of their out-of-pocket cost requirements at
the time of the physician visit. After controlling for numerous
physician and patient level variables, we found that patients enrolled
in pharmacy benefit designs requiring no copayments were more likely to
report they ``never{''} discuss out-of-pocket costs with physicians
compared with patients enrolled in incentive-based pharmacy benefit
designs (81% vs 67%, P = .001) and patients with no prescription drug
insurance (57%, P < .001).
Incentive-based pharmacy benefit plans and lack of insurance are
associated with increased rates of discussions about out-of-pocket
costs. Nonetheless, most incentive-based enrollees are unaware of
out-of-pocket costs when prescriptions are written and never discuss
out-of-pocket costs with their physicians, likely mitigating the
effectiveness of financial incentives to guide decision making.
Considering that out-of-pocket costs are associated with adherence to
medical therapy, interventions to improve patient access to
out-of-pocket cost information and the frequency of patient-physician
discussions about costs are needed.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Managed care organizations can increase the value of drug
therapy by negotiating discounts on drug acquisition costs with
pharmaceutical manufacturers and promoting use of preferred drugs,
including the conversion of patients to preferred medications This
investigation was designed to assess conversion success, migraine drug
utilizations, and patient satisfaction with a clinical
pharmacist-managed conversion program from sumatriptan to rizatriptan
ODT, both formulary drugs.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study conducted in a managed
care organization for patents aged 18 years or older who had picked up
at least one outpatient prescription for any sumatriptan dosage form at
the pharmacy between January 2002 and June 2002. Patents' pharmacy and
medical data were reviewed to assess eligibility (e.g., no history of
rizatriptan failure) for conversion from sumatriptan to rizatriptan
orally disintegrating tablet (ODT). There was no copayment difference
for members for rizatriptan DDT versus sumatriptan. A questionnaire was
developed to assess 2 domains. (1) patient satisfaction with the
medication conversion process and (2) preference for rizatriptan DDT or
sumatriptan. A random sample of 315 patents who initiated conversion to
rizatriptan DDT was surveyed. Electronic pharmacy claims were reviewed
to determine the number of patients who were successfully converted from
sumatriptan to rizatriptan DDT Pharmacy expenditures and total health
care utilization and expenditures in the 180 days prior to (baseline)
and after the conversion (follow-up) to rizatriptan DDT were compared
for the cohorts of subjects who were successfully converted and those
patients who were not successfully converted.
RESULTS: Therapeutic conversion from sumatriptan to rizatriptan DDT was
attempted in 457 patients; 214 (47%) were successfully converted The
only difference between the 2 cohorts at baseline for the 6 months prior
to attempted conversion was a higher mean number of sumatriptan doses
per patient per month (PPPM) in the 243 failed conversions (mean 3 5, SD
2.9) compared with the 214 successful conversions (mean 2.8, SD 2.8,
P=0.003). The median triptan doses increased by 1.0 PPPM in both cohorts
(P=0.882), from 2 0 to 3 0 doses PPPM in the group of successful
conversions and from 2 7 to 4 0 in the group of unsuccessful
conversions. The survey response rate was 55% for both successful and
for unsuccessful conversions. More than 90% of the patients in both
cohorts were satisfied with the level of care provided by the clinical
pharmacy staff during medication conversion, and there was no difference
between the 2 cohorts in patient satisfaction (P=0.761). Rizatriptan DDT
was preferred by 68.0% and 8.5% of successful and failed conversion
subjects, respectively (P<0 001). Using representative group purchase
prices, triptan expenditures for successful conversion subjects were
reduced by a median of -$2 (6 %) PPPM while triptan expenditures for
unsuccessful conversions increased by a median of $8 (P<0.001). There
were no differences for either cohort in median PPPM changes in
migraine-related office visits (0.0 median change in office visits,
P=0.748) or office-visit costs (SO median change, P=0 861) for
preconversion versus postconversion attempts Regression modeling
identified that lower total counts of sumatriptan doses filled during
baseline period was an independent predictor of successful conversion to
rizatriptan DDT (P<0.001). There was an average of 3.5 triptan
medication fills per patient for successful conversion during the
6-month follow-up period, with 78% of these subjects filling at least 2
prescriptions for rizatriptan DDT during this period.
CONCLUSIONS. This conversion program for sumatriptan to rizatriptan DDT
was successful in converting almost half of primary care patients to the
preferred product despite the absence of a copayment incentive for
members to agree to the conversion. There were no measurable medical or
economic consequences of the conversion, and patient satisfaction with
the quality of care was maintained. Future efforts are likely to have a
higher success rate if focused on converting patients with less-severe
migraine headaches, as measured by the need for baseline rescue
medication, since lower acuity was the only independent predictor of
successful conversion in this conversion program for 2 triptan drugs.

N2  - Experiments on incentives have a long history in survey research,
particularly in mail surveys but increasingly in other modes too. Most
of this work has focused on variations in incentive type, timing, and
amount on response rates. There has been relatively little research
examining the effect of different incentives on nonresponse error.
Furthermore, most of the studies on incentives have been within a single
mode. No studies, to our knowledge, have examined the effect of
incentives in a study using more than one mode. This paper adds to the
methodological literature on incentives in several ways. Although we
compare a cash incentive vs. an in-kind incentive, which has been done
several times, we examine these effects in both a face-to-face and mail
survey. The cash incentive yielded higher response rates than the
in-kind incentive in the mail survey. Furthermore, the in-kind incentive
was related to one of the topics of a metropolitan area survey,
permitting us to examine possible effects of the incentive on the
composition of the resulting sample as an indicator of potential
nonresponse error. Specifically, the in-kind incentive was a set of
passes to regional parks, and the survey included a variety of questions
on behavior and attitudes related to park use. We found that, although
there were demographic differences between incentive groups, the
response distributions on key related variables did not vary by
incentive type.

N2  - Objective. To examine the association between smoking and general health
as measured by the Short-Fonn Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire.
Methods. Data derived are from three cross-sectional surveys conducted
in 2000, 2001 and 2002. Respondents to the postal surveys were
middle-aged employees of the City of Helsinki (1799 men and 7171 women,
response rate 67%). Smoking status was divided into current heavy and
moderate smokers, ex-smokers and never smokers. Health status was
measured by the eight SF-36 subscales and the physical and mental
component summaries.
Results. On the physical subscales, current smokers reported poorer
health than non-smokers on general health and physical functioning in
men. On the mental subscales, current smokers had consistently poorer
health than non-smokers. However, often only heavy smokers differed from
non-smokers. No differences were found between ex-smokers and never
smokers on any subscale or the component summades of the SF-36.
Conclusions. Differences between smoking categories were found on some
physical and all mental subscales of the SF-36. The differences were
slightly larger among men. As heavy smokers more often report
limitations with daily activities as well as loss of well-being, these
impairments potentially provide valuable incentives for non-smoking to
be used in health education messages and interventions. (c) 2005

N2  - Background: Africa is in an orphan-care crisis. In Zimbabwe, where
one-fourth of adults are HIV-positive and one-fifth of children are
orphans, AIDS and economic decline are straining society's ability to
care for orphans within their extended families. Lack of stable care is
putting thousands of children at heightened risk of malnourishment,
emotional underdevelopment, illiteracy, poverty, sexual exploitation,
and HIV infection, endangering the future health of the society they are
expected to sustain.
Methods: To explore barriers and possible incentives to orphan care, a
quantitative cross-sectional survey in rural eastern Zimbabwe asked 371
adults caring for children, including 212 caring for double orphans,
about their well-being, needs, resources, and perceptions and
experiences of orphan care.
Results: Survey responses indicate that: 1) foster caregivers are
disproportionately female, older, poor, and without a spouse; 2) 98% of
non-foster caregivers are willing to foster orphans, many from outside
their kinship network; 3) poverty is the primary barrier to fostering;
4) financial, physical, and emotional stress levels are high among
current and potential fosterers; 5) financial need may be greatest in
single-orphan AIDS-impoverished households; and 6) struggling families
lack external support.
Conclusion: Incentives for sustainable orphan care should focus on
financial assistance, starting with free schooling, and development of
community mechanisms to identify and support children in need, to
evaluate and strengthen families' capacity to provide orphan care, and
to initiate and support placement outside the family when necessary.

N2  - Background Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among long-term
survivors of coronary artery bypass surgery is an important outcome that
has been little studied at the population level.
Methods A postal survey was conducted in 1999 to 2000 in patients 6 to
20 years after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery in
Western-Australia. A random stratified sample of 2500 was drawn from
8910 patients who had their first CABG surgery in 1980 to 1993.
Health-related quality of life was measured with Short Form 36 and
EuroQol visual analogue scale.
Results Response was 82% (n = 2061). Health-related quality of life
declined with age and was similar for men and women, although scores for
women were worse for physical functioning. Compared with Australian
population norms, the age- and sex-standardized scores of survivors of
CABG were generally worse, mainly in the physical domain. Reported
angina at the time of follow-up (33%), symptoms of heart failure
equivalent to New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes II to IV (34%),
and comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension were associated with
poorer HRQOL. For both men and women without angina or heart failure at
follow-up, HRQOL was no different from that of the general population.
Conclusion Overall, the quality of life among long-term survivors of
CABG is worse than that of the general population, the difference being
mainly attributable to recurrent symptoms and comorbidities. Quality of
life for those without angina or heart failure at follow-up was
equivalent to the population norms, providing an incentive to maximize
efforts to abolish angina and ameliorate heart failure symptoms.

goal was to compare the knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about breast
cancer among Northern Plains Reservation women who had and had not
receivedscreening mammography in the previous year Another goal was to
compare response rates achieved with an immediate monetary incentive to
those achieved with an incentive after survey completion. Questionnaires
were mailed to 234 women who had undergone screening mammography and 266
women who had not. Respondents included 144 (62%) of women who had been
screened and 127 (48%) of women who had not. Women who had not received
mammography less often were aware that older age increased breast cancer
risk compared to women who had had a mammogram in the previous year
Findings suggest that Northern plains women would benefit from
educational efforts and discussions with clinicians about mammography
Immediate monetary incentives appear to increase response rates.

N2  - In response to the nursing shortage, many hospitals offer sign-on
bonuses to attract nurses. There are anecdotal reports that the use of
such incentives negatively affects staff nurse morale. The present study
is the first to empirically examine the reactions of staff nurses who
have not received sign-on bonuses. Most of the 800 surveyed nurses were
not opposed to the use of incentives, but almost all were concerned
about the potential for negative impact on retention. Compared to nurses
working in hospitals that did not offer sign-on bonuses, nurses working
in hospitals that offer sign-on bonuses reported higher levels of anger
and lower levels of optimism. Greater anger and less optimism were
associated with a reduced sense of distributive justice. The less fairly
treated nurses felt, the greater likelihood of withdrawal from the
hospital. The use of recruitment incentives may result in reduced work
effort or loss of experienced nurses, exacerbating the nursing shortage.

N2  - BACKGROUND Little information is available nationally about critical
care units and nurses. What is known about nurses in hospitals is
generally not broken down among all the specialties.
OBJECTIVES To describe issues of work force, compensation, and care
specific to critical care units and nurses who work in them.
METHODS The American Association of Critical-Care Nurses conducted a
survey of randomly, selected facilities with critical care units in the
United States. Facilities were solicited via e-mail to respond to a
survey on the World Wide Web and provide information on operations,
evaluations, nursing staff reimbursement and incentives, staffing, and
quality indicators. Responding facilities also provided contact
information for units in the facilities. Those units were surveyed about
operations, acuity systems, staffing, policies on visitation and
end-of-life care, administrative structure, documentation,
certification, professional advancement, vancancy/floating, staff
satisfaction, orientation, association membership, wages, advanced
practice nursing, and quality indicators.
RESULTS The initial response rate (120 of 658 eligible facilities) was
18.2%, and 300 of 576 solicited units nominated by the facilities
responded, yielding a 52.1% response rate for the second phase.
CONCLUSIONS These survey data define the scope and intensity of services
offered and provide more specific figures about staffing issues and unit
practices than has been accessible before. Healthcare providers may use
this information for benchmarking purposes, especially for instances in
which the tables provide data for each particular ope of critical care
unit.

N2  - Background: The educational needs of patients with irritable bowel
syndrome (IBS) are poorly understood and rarely studied.
Aim: To determine the educational needs of IBS patients, regarding
content, presentation format, and expectations from healthcare
providers.
Methods: Fifteen functional GI clinic patients were asked open-ended
questions to generate items for a questionnaire addressing the study
aim. A total of 104 IBS patients received this questionnaire by mail (42
had declined to participate in a prior IBS study). To assess the
frequency of endorsements and importance (on a scale of 1-3) of the
items, an index was calculated (frequency of endorsements X mean rating
per item, first priority scored 3, third priority scored 1). A higher
index indicated greater endorsement based on frequency and rating of
response.
Results: A total of 29 (28%) subjects (22 willing, 7 unwilling to
participate previously in questionnaire research) completed the
questionnaire (mean age, 42.6 years; SD, 14.2 years; 19 female, 10
male). The overall low response rate is likely related to the population
studied; 40.4% of our study subjects have declined participation in
prior research. The response rate of those who have previously agreed to
participate was 36%. The typical response profile included: interest in
learning disease management (index = 1.4) and preference for information
presented in person by an M.D. (2.4). Choice of presentation media
included magazines (1.9), television (1.5), and Web sites (1.2).
Doctors' qualities ranked high related to competency (0.8), allocation
of sufficient time (0.7), and listening skills (0.4). Preferred
incentives for research participation included a thank you note (0.4),
summary of trial results (0.3), and monetary incentives (0.6).
Conclusions: This qualitative study will provide pilot data for a
national survey on the educational needs of IBS patients, for use in
developing effective patient-centered, educational programs.

N2  - While nonresponse rates in household surveys are increasing in most
industrialized nations, the increasing rates do not always produce
nonresponse bias in survey estimates. The linkage between nonresponse
rates and nonresponse bias arises from the presence of a covariance
between response propensity and the survey variables of interest. To
understand the covariance term, researchers must think about the common
influences on response propensity and the survey variable. Three
variables appear to be especially relevant in this regard: interest in
the survey topic, reactions to the survey sponsor, and the use of
incentives. A set of randomized experiments tests whether those likely
to be interested in the stated survey topic participate at higher rates
and whether nonresponse bias on estimates involving variables central to
the survey topic is affected by this. The experiments also test whether
incentives disproportionately increase the participation of those less
interested in the topic. The experiments show mixed results in support
of these key hypotheses.

N2  - European public transport operators, first in Paris and then in
Brussels, Belgium, have developed a framework, a standard, and
certification procedures for the management of service quality. Based on
Averous's service quality cycle, this framework incorporates both
customer satisfaction and performance evaluation with service standards
and service indicators that are customer oriented yet objectively
measurable. The develops ment of this quality movement is documented,
and its implementation in Brussels is used as a case study. There, the
management contract provides financial incentives based on the
percentage of passengers, served by lines whose service quality has been
certified, and the organization chart includes several managers
responsible for service quality. The process of defining service targets
is described with a framework that emphasizes extreme values and
specification of both a base level and a level of unacceptability that
demands immediate action. Special attention is given to two methods of
performance measurement: automatic processing of archived automatic
vehicle location data and ``mystery shopper{''} surveys. Improvements,
organizational changes, and new programs developed in response to the
quality process are described.

N2  - Whether the number of organs available for transplant would be
positively or negatively affected by providing benefits to families of
organ donors has been debated by policymakers, ethicists and the
transplant community at large. We designed a telephone survey to measure
public opinion regarding the use of benefits in general and of five
types in particular: funeral benefits, charitable contributions,
travel/lodging expenses, direct payments and medical expenses. Of the
971 adults who completed the survey (response rate = 69%), all were
from Pennsylvania households, 45.6% were registered organ donors, and
51.7% were nonwhite. Although 59% of respondents favored the general
idea of incentives, support for specific incentives ranged from 53%
(direct payment) to 84% (medical expenses). Among those registered as
donors, more nonwhites than whites supported funeral benefits (88% vs.
81%; p = 0.038), direct payment (63% vs. 41%; p < 0.001) and medical
expenses (92% vs. 84%; p = 0.013). Among those not registered as
donors, more nonwhites supported direct payment (64% vs. 46%; p =
0.001). Most respondents believed that benefits would not influence
their own behavior concerning donation but would influence the behavior
of others. While benefits appear to be favored, their true impact can
only be assessed through pilot programs.

N2  - Given the weaker ties to community as noted by scholars such as Robert
Putnam, survey researchers should not be surprised by a decline in
survey participation over the past 10 years. This research analyzes the
use of incentives coupled with introductory themes emphasizing
cooperation and helpfulness-cooperative norms in American society-to
understand their effects on survey response. This article analyzes two
separate experiments (one phone and one mail) that provide evidence that
norms of cooperation matter in the decision to participate in a survey,
suggesting that this is particularly true at the refusal conversion
stage. These results indicate that survey researchers may use such

N2  - Background: Achieving acceptable response rates from health care
providers via postal questionnaires is an ongoing challenge. The use of
monetary incentives is one of the most effective strategies for
increasing response rates. However, the effect and cost of such an
incentive on retail pharmacists' response rates has not been well
studied.
Methods: A sample of 700 pharmacies was selected at random from the
electronic Yellow Pages in NSW Australia and mailed a brief survey
regarding pharmacotherapies and advice for smoking cessation. Half of
the sample was randomly allocated to receive an offer of an US$14 gift
voucher.
Results: The response rates were 65.9% for the voucher group and 53.5%
for the no-voucher group. The odds of response from the voucher group
was 1.68 (95%CI = 1.23, 2.30) times greater than for the no-voucher
group. The cost per additional respondent was US$67.95. The incentive
also reduced follow up costs by 10%.
Conclusions: A moderately sized monetary incentive is able to achieve a
significant increase in response rates for retail pharmacists, thereby
reducing potential bias in the sample.

N2  - Purpose: Barriers to simulation-based education in postgraduate and
continuing education for anesthesiologists have not been well studied.
We hypothesized that the level of training may influence attitudes
towards simulation-based education and impact on the use of simulation.
This study investigated this issue at the University of Toronto which
possesses two sites equipped with high-fidelity patient simulators.
Methods: A 40-question survey of experiences, perceptions, motivations
and perceived barriers to simulation-based education, was distributed to
154 anesthesiologists attending a departmental conference. Data were
analyzed using descriptive statistics and associations between responses
were assessed using either the Chi-Square statistic or a one-way
analysis of variance.
Results: The rate of response was 58%. Residents had experienced
simulation-based education (96%) more often than staff (58%) and
fellows (36%), (P < 0.001 respectively). Residents had also attended
more simulation sessions than staff and fellows (mean 2.8 vs 1.05 and
1.04, P < 0.001 respectively). Residents and fellows found
simulation-based education more relevant for their training than staff
(88% vs 65%, P < 0.05). Eighty-one percent of the respondents
identified at least one significant barrier that prevents or limits them
from attending simulator sessions. Staff anesthesiologists perceived
multiple barriers and identified `time' and `financial issues' as
significant barriers.
Conclusion: Anesthesiologists' level of training influences their
attitudes towards and their perceptions of simulation-based education.
This survey has identified perceived barriers that may limit a wider
utilization of simulation. These results may be used to implement
targeted actions such as course design, incentives, and information
strategies, which could improve access and future use of simulation.

N2  - Improving Medicaid program effectiveness for underserved populations is
hampered by low survey response rates. This study determined how to
maximize Medicaid consumer satisfaction survey response rates to the
Consumer Assessment of Health Plans Study (CAHPS) survey. In a public
immunization clinic, 8 focus groups and 15 extended interviews were used
to assess consumer-preferred survey design features and incentives. To
test hypotheses, we conducted the following trial. Out of 10,733 total
participants in a Kansas Medicaid managed care plan, 3,685 eligible for
CAHPS were unduplicated by household. After randomization of the 968
households with valid addresses to one of three groups, a controlled
trial was conducted to assess response rates to CAHPS survey formats and
incentives. Response rates were 35% for a standard mailing, 44% for a
user-friendly low-literacy mailing, and 64% for a user-friendly
low-literacy mailing with a $10 contingent incentive. Both experimental
arms significantly improved response compared with the control; the
response rate of the mailing group with the incentive was higher than
the response rate of the group receiving that mailing without any
incentive (p < 0.0001). Using consumer-based preferences significantly
increased response rates to this Medicaid satisfaction survey. Raising
CAHPS response rates may increase validity of Medicaid consumer
satisfaction information.

N2  - Background. Adequate access to dental care for young
children-particularly those from low-income families-is a public
concern. The authors conducted a survey of Ohio dental care providers to
examine factors influencing their willingness to care for these
children.
Methods. Random samples of Ohio general practitioner (GPs) dentists and
pediatric dentists (PDs) and all Ohio safety-net dental clinics
completed a mail survey regarding treatment of children aged 0 through 5
years. The authors categorized responses by provider type and further
analyzed GPs' responses by years since graduation and geographic
character.
Results. Few Ohio GPs (8 percent) recommended a first dental visit by 1
year of age. While 91 percent of GPs treated children aged 3 through 5
years, only 34 percent treated children aged 0 through 2 years, most
often for emergency visits or examinations. Only 7 percent of all GPs
and 29 percent of PDs accepted patients enrolled in Medicaid without
limitations.
Conclusions. Children's being young (0-2 years of age) and having
Medicaid as a payment source made GPs substantially less likely to treat
them. Children's being enrolled in Head Start made GPs somewhat more
likely to treat them.
Practice Implications. New strategies for ensuring dental care access
for young children from low-income families are necessary. Such
strategies may take the form of interpeer advocacy, education, practice
incentives or creation of coordinated GP and PD teams.

N2  - Purpose. To document use of health risk appraisals (HRAs) by U.S.
physician organizations as part of their overall approach to health
promotion and to identify associated organizational characteristics.
Methods. Telephone survey of 1590 physician organizations in the United
States; surveys were conducted in organizations comprising 20 or more
physicians and were conducted between September 2000 and September 2001
(70% response rate). Chi-square tests and logistic regression analysis
were used to examine the association between organizational
characteristics and routine administration of HRAs.
Results. Only 22.5% of physician organizations in the United States
routinely administer HRAs. External quality incentives, information
technology capabilities, and status as a medical group vs. an
independent practice association are associated with greater odds of the
routine use of HRA.
Discussion. Increased use of external quality incentives and information
technology in physician organizations may be important in supporting the
use of HRAs.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Disease registries are lists of patients with a particular
chronic illness. including clinical information, to improve the care of
individuals and populations. The objective of this study was to
determine the prevalence of disease registries in physician
organizations and the extent to which they are used to improve care.
DESIGN., A cross-sectional national telephone survey with a response
rate of 70%.
SETTING: All physician organizations in the United States with 20
physicians or more.
PARTICIPANTS: Chief executive officers, presidents, or medical directors
of 1040 physician organizations.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Forty-seven percent of organizations
reported having a registry for at least I chronic illness, with diabetes
registries being the most common. Half (51%) of the registries were not
linked to clinical data. Organizations with at least I registry were
more likely to have implemented other chronic care improvements (P
<.0001). Factors associated with the presence of registries in physician
organizations include external incentives for quality and extent of
information technology capabilities.
CONCLUSIONS: Disease registries are not utilized by half of physician
organizations. This finding is disturbing because registries have the
potential to catalyze needed improvement in chronic care management.

health nursing (PHN) undergraduate, graduate, and continuing education
(CE) made by staff-level public health nurses working in local health
departments (LHDs). Implications for academia and practice are
discussed.
Design: A cross-sectional written survey was used to collect data from
424 public health nurses in 76 LHDs in Wisconsin (68% response rate) in
2003. Recommendations for improving undergraduate, graduate, and CE were
made through responses to open-ended survey questions. Content analysis
was conducted to identify major themes among responses.
Results: Major themes emerging from the recommendations for
undergraduate education included the need for more clinical public
health experiences and population-focused practice content. Graduate
education improvement recommendations included addressing access
barriers and increasing organizational incentives. Improved access and
more public health content were the major recommendations for improving
CE.
Conclusions: Implications for academia focus on increasing opportunities
for students to experience population-focused PHN and to learn
organizational and collaborative practice skills, supporting PHN
preceptors and building evidence for PHN intervention through research.
Implications for practice include the need to expand opportunities for
students with LHDs and to collaborate with academic partners for
education and research.

N2  - We carried out an experiment that compared telephone and Web versions of
a questionnaire that assessed attitudes toward science and knowledge of
basic scientific facts. Members of a random digit dial (RDD) sample were
initially contacted by telephone and answered a few screening questions,
including one that asked whether they had-Internet access. Those with
Internet access were randomly assigned to complete either a Web version
of the questionnaire or a computer-assisted telephone interview. There
were four main findings. First, although we offered cases assigned to
the Web survey a larger incentive, fewer of them completed the online
questionnaire; almost all those who were assigned to the telephone
condition completed the interview. The two samples of Web users
nonetheless had similar demographic characteristics. Second, the Web
survey produced less item nonresponse than the telephone survey. The Web
questionnaire prompted respondents- when they left an item blank,
whereas the telephone interviewers accepted ``no opinion{''} answers
without probing them. Third, Web respondents gave less differentiated
answers to batteries of attitude items than their telephone
counterparts. The Web questionnaire presented these items in a grid that
may have made their similarity more salient.
Finally, Web respondents took longer to complete the knowledge items,
particularly those requiring open-ended answers, than the telephone
respondents, and Web respondents answered a higher percentage of them
correctly. These differences between Web and telephone surveys probably
reflect both inherent differences between the two modes and incidental
features of our implementation of the survey. The mode differences also
vary by item type and by respondent age.

N2  - Nonmonetary incentives lead to small increases in response rates to
mailed questionnaires. However, inclusion of a pen or pencil, which may
be a facilitating factor as well as a reward, has not been shown to
improve response to health surveys in prior trials. In 2001 and 2002,
the authors conducted two US trials in which a study-logo pen or pencil
was randomly included in a second questionnaire mailed to nonresponders
to a first mailing. In the first study, of 10,686 nonresponders to a
cohort recruitment mailing, response to the second mailing was 55% with
inclusion of a pen versus 40% without one (p < 0.001). In the second
study, of 141 nonresponders to a pilot follow-up survey conducted 2
years after entry into a cohort, response was 43% with inclusion of a
pencil versus 24% without one (p = 0.02). This 15-19 percentage point
increase for mailing 2 translated to a 5-6 percentage point increase
after the two mailings combined. In a simulated study of three mailings
based on these studies, the overall response rate increased by 4
percentage points at no added cost through inclusion of a pencil in the
second mailing. The additional cost of the pencil was compensated for by
the reduced number of nonrespondents sent packets at the third mailing.
This study supports including a study-logo pen or pencil in a second
questionnaire mailing to nonrespondents as a cost-effective method of
increasing response rates.

N2  - Theory and evidence suggests that respondents are likely to overreport
voter turnout in election surveys because they have a strong incentive
to offer a socially desirable response. We suggest that contextual
influences may affect the socially desirable bias, leading to variance
in the rate of over-reporting across countries. This leads us to
hypothesize that nonvoters will be more likely to overreport voting in
elections that have high turnout. We rely on validated turnout data to
measure overreporting in five countries which vary a great deal in
turnout: Britain, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and the United States. We
find that in national settings with higher levels of participation, the
tendency to overreport turnout may be greater than in settings where low
participation is the norm.

N2  - Purpose To test the effect of a $AU 2 scratch lottery ticket on
response rates to a national mailed questionnaire of Australian general
practitioners (GPs) and medical specialists.
Methods A randomized controlled trial Was conducted and the incentive
sent to half of the participants with the first mailing. A single
follow-up mailing without incentive was sent to all non-respondents.
Survey respondents were then informed of the research question regarding
incentives and allowed to withdraw their study data. Differences in
response rates between doctors receiving and not receiving the
incentive, and between respondents and non-respondents, were examined.
Results The overall response rate was 47% (443 respondents). Twenty-two
respondents (5%) withdrew their data after being informed of the
research question. Of the remaining 421 respondents, 233 had received
the incentive (response rate 49.7%) and 188 had not (40.1%, p =
0.0032). The absolute increase in response rate with the incentive
(9.6%, 95%CI 3.2, 15.9) was quantitatively similar in effect to the
reminder mailing (11.8%). The incentive had a larger effect among the
GP sample compared with specialists (13.4 vs. 5.9%), although the
difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.20). There were no
systematic differences in demographic characteristics between
respondents and non-respondents.
Conclusions Increased response rates associated with a small incentive
may reduce the need for a second mailed reminder, but strong views about
the use of incentives may negatively influence the participation of some
practitioners. While the overall response rate was low, there was no
evidence of bias in our sample. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons,

asthma care in general practice. This study aimed to identify factors
associated with uptake of the plan by general practitioners, and their
views on barriers and facilitators to implementation of the plan.
Design: Postal survey sent to a random sample of GPs.
Participants and setting: 315 GPs in five Divisions of General Practice
in metropolitan Sydney, surveyed sequentially between 1 October 2002 and
31 May 2003.
Outcome measures: Awareness and use of the Asthma 3+ Visit Plan; GP and
practice factors associated with use of the plan; and GP views on
barriers and facilitators to implementing the plan.
Results: The response rate was 55.7%, and 72.1% of participants were
male; participants' mean age was 50.5 years. Most GPs (91.2%) were
aware of the plan and and 44.9% had used it. GP and practice factors
associated with use of the plan were use of the six-step Australian
Asthma Management Plan, confidence in aspects of asthma care, practice
accreditation, sign-up for asthma incentives, and computerisation. Major
barriers to implementating the plan were workload/paperwork and
administrative complexities. Patient factors that influenced completion
of the plan were their concept of the severity of their asthma,
compliance with follow-up, and patient attitudes towards asthma care.
Conclusion: The perceived workload and administrative complexity of the
asthma incentives are barriers to uptake. Factors relating to the
illness rather than social factors are seen as the most important
influences on completion of the plan by patients.

N2  - In this field investigation, a new approach for evaluating energy
conservation and awareness programs within residential consumers is
presented and discussed. It is based on expert computer knowledge-based
systems and fuzzy set analyses. Computer-programmed surveys were carried
out on a random sample of energy users in Jordan, such as students,
housewives and educated and uneducated citizens, before and after they
received a simple energy educational material. The fuzzy set logic
technique enabled to condense large data into a small set of variable
rules. Relative weights were given for each response and a cumulative
grade was estimated. This in turn made the employed expert system
effective in evaluating energy conservation programs. The follow-up
survey revealed that a reasonable rise, of about 15%, of energy related
knowledge was achieved, as compared to the initial survey. Fuzzy set
analyses suggest that some fluctuations in the relative rise of public
awareness programs may be attributed to insufficient knowledge. Thus,
through public awareness and demonstration programs as well as
incentives, such as financial assistance and technical aid to encourage
energy end-users, in all sectors, to employ the latest technologies and
more energy-efficient equipment, final energy demand can be reduced or
controlled. Hence, energy efficiency should be incorporated as a corner
stone of the national energy policy. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

N2  - Background The Medical Council in Ireland is currently implementing
Competence Assurance Structures (CAS). Peer review has been proposed as
a tool to measure physician competence.
Aims To assess the attitudes of physicians working in the Irish
healthcare system to a peer review programme of competence assurance
prior to its implementation.
Methods A postal survey was sent to all physicians in the Irish Medical
Directory in November 2003. Nine questions were asked to gauge attitudes
to peer review as a CA tool. The returned questionnaires were collated
and data extracted based on responses.
Results The response rate was 67%. The majority of respondents (92%)
felt peer review would inform competence assurance in Ireland. Most
physicians who were surveyed felt an on-site assessment (88%) every 5
years (87%) was the preferred method. Over 30% responded that there
should be a financial incentive for completing a review, and 70% would
pay to be assessed. The UK model of competence assurance was the model
most physicians preferred for the Irish setting (42%).
Conclusion The majority of physicians practising in Ireland would favour
a peer review system of competence assurance. The financial
implications, and structure, of such a system would need to be explored
prior to implementation.

N2  - Background and Purpose: The introduction of the case-based payment
system by the Bureau of National Health Insurance resulted in greatly
increased pressure on the health care industry in Taiwan. This study
examined the relationship between the coping strategies adopted and the
results attained by accredited teaching hospitals and non-teaching
regional hospitals when responding to this regulatory change.
Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted using a structured
questionnaire to assess the hospitals' characteristics, and coping
strategies at the technical, managerial and institutional levels in
response to the case-based payment system, and to compare these
strategies with self-evaluation of the effectiveness of these
strategies. The questionnaire was sent in early October 2000 to the
superintendents of the 129 hospitals that were accredited at the medical
center, regional hospital, and district teaching hospital levels in the
year 2000. Factor analysis was applied to group the strategies into
categories and stepwise regression analysis was used to explore the
relationship between the reported coping strategies adopted and their
effectiveness as evaluated by participants.
Results: Among the selected hospitals, 89 responded with complete data,
a 69% response rate. The following 7 factors were extracted from 30
coping strategies: information and financial analysis; service shifting
and unbundling; service integration and quality improvement; service
specialization and strengthening; education and training; financial
incentives; and claim submission skill. After adjusting for
accreditation level or ownership status, 2 main findings were noted.
First, hospitals that implemented financial incentives strategies such
as holding physicians responsible for all or part of the shortfall
between actual claim submissions and actual reimbursements, and reducing
or withholding payment to physicians beyond the standard length of stay,
tended to increase medical revenue (odds ratio, 1.21). Second, hospitals
that implemented service integration and quality improvement strategies,
such as implementing a discharge plan, implementing clinical pathways
and periodic review of quality indicators, attained higher patient
satisfaction rate (odds ratio, 1.40).
Conclusions: This study suggests that hospitals confronting the
implementation of a case based-payment system may benefit by adopting
financial incentives strategies and by efforts to improve service
integration and quality.

Conditional logit models indicate that developers find contaminated
sites less attractive, and that they value liability relief Moreover,
developers with prior contaminated site experience are very responsive
to government subsidies, whereas inexperienced developers are more
responsive to liability and regulatory relief. These results suggest
that market-based incentives and regulatory relief can influence land

N2  - Incentive and assistance programs for nonindustrial private landowners
in Michigan were evaluated for their effectiveness in encouraging forest
management activities. This article reports on selected results of a
comparative analysis of program enrollment, landowner characteristics,
and management accomplishments. The analysis was based on data from a
survey of 2,230 nonindustrial private forestland (NIPF) owners who were
members of the Michigan Forest Association (MFA) or were enrolled in the
Commercial Forest Program (CF), the Forest Stewardship Program (FSP), or
the Two-Hearted River Watershed (TRW) landowner program in 2000. With a
55% overall response rate, landowners reported on present and past
management activities and program enrollment. To address the question of
the effectiveness of incentive programs, this comparative analysis
tested the hypotheses that forest management activity reported by
Michigan NIPF landowners who were enrolled in several types of incentive
programs did not differ significantly by program and that management
activity was not significantly explained by landowner demographics and
parcel characteristics. Landowner program enrollment was compared with
respect to tree-planting, timber harvesting, timber stand improvement,
wildlife habitat improvement, and soil and water protection. To examine
the differences, if any, between landowners who practice forest
management and those who do not, explanatory demographic and parcel
characteristic variables also were tested for their effect on management

N2  - Objective: Mailed surveys are widely used to collect epidemiologic and
health service data. Given that nonresponse can threaten the validity of
surveys, modest incentives are often used to increase response rates. A
study was undertaken among childhood cancer survivors and their parents
to determine if response rate to a mailed survey differed with provision
of immediate versus delayed incentives.
Design: A self-administered survey designed to ascertain health
behaviors was mailed to 397 childhood cancer survivors (and their
parents if the survivor was &LT; 18 years of age). Subjects were
randomized into two groups based on gender, age, race, and cancer type.
One group received a $10 incentive with their blank survey
(unconditional incentive), whereas the other group received the
incentive upon receipt of their completed survey (conditional
incentive). If children were minors, both the parent and the child
received incentives.
Results: No significant differences in response rates were observed with
respect to gender, age, race, or cancer type. However, significant
differences in response rates were observed between incentive groups,
with unconditional incentives yielding significantly higher response
rates than conditional incentives for child survivors who were &GE; 18
years (64.4% versus 49.0%), as well as younger child survivors (62.5%
versus 43.6%) and their parents (64.8% versus 41.5%; all P &LT;
0.05).
Conclusions: The provision of an immediate incentive generated
significantly higher response rates to this mailed health survey among
childhood cancer survivors and their parents. Given that survey studies
are commonly conducted across various pediatric populations, these
findings may help inform the design of future pediatric survey research.

N2  - Background: Monetary incentives in survey research may provide important
gains from a methodological perspective in the control and reduction of
survey error associated with potential nonresponse of participants.
However, few studies have systematically investigated the use of
monetary incentives or other methods to improve the response rates in
the nonphysician clinician population.
Objective: To investigate differences in response rates to a mailed
self-administered survey of nonphysician clinicians who were randomized
to receive a prepaid monetary incentive, a postsurvey prize drawing, or
no incentive.
Methods: A randomized controlled trial of financial incentives was
conducted from November 2002 to February 2003. Nonphysician clinicians
(nurse practitioners {[}NPs] and physician assistants {[}PAs]; N =
3,900) randomly selected to participate in a national ethics-related
study were assigned randomly in equal allocations (n = 1,300 {[}650 NPs,
650 PAs]) to three incentive groups: (a) no incentive; (b) a $5 prepaid
token incentive in the initial mailing; or (c) a chance to win one of
ten $100 prize drawings upon completion and return of a
self-administered survey.
Results: A $5 cash incentive increased survey response rates to an
adjusted 64.2 %: a 19.5 percentage point increase over the lottery
group (44.7 % response rate), and a 22 percentage point increase over
the control group (42.2 % response rate).
Discussion: A nominal cash incentive of $5 yields a significantly
higher response rate from nonphysician providers than receiving either a
lottery option or no incentive.

N2  - Question under study: Due to low response rates mail surveys have been
called into question as research instruments in general practice. The
most effective actions to reduce non-response, such as financial
incentives and complex follow-up procedures, are costly. We investigated
whether a good response rate is achievable with a less costly survey
design, and examined the effect of increased response rates due to
repeated follow-ups on survey results.
Methods: In a mail survey on drug interactions among 2000 general
practitioners in south-west Germany, most well-known criteria
influencing response rates were met except financial incentives. A four
stage design with two reminders was applied and the time course of
response was recorded.
Results after both reminders were calculated with 95% confidence
intervals and compared with initial results using the
Jonckheere-Terpstra test with correction for multiple testing. A p <
0.01 was considered significant. Results: Although we did not provide
financial incentives we achieved a response rate of 60.8% with our
survey design. The first reminder with a simple postcard was almost
three times less effective than the second reminder including another
copy of the questionnaire. For only two survey questions, the answers of
late respondents differed significantly from those of initial
respondents (p < 0.01). For these two questions, cumulative results
after both reminders never differed from initial results by more than
3.7%.
Conclusion: Even if financial incentives are not affordable, good
response rates can be obtained among general practitioners when surveys
are meticulously planned and implemented. Potential non-response bias
introduced by those general practitioners who do not answer despite
numerous reminders, cannot be tested by comparing early and late
respondents. Therefore, we suggest that the impact of reminders on
survey results should be assessed early. If no bias can be detected one
further reminder with a copy of the questionnaire might result in
estimates very similar to those after numerous reminders.

N2  - Objectives: We sought to evaluate the effect of pairing a mixed-mode
mail and telephone methodology with a prepaid $2.00 cash incentive on
response rates in a survey of Medicaid enrollees stratified by race and
ethnicity.
Research Design: Sampling was conducted in 2 stages. The first stage
consisted of a simple random sample (SRS) of Medicaid enrollees. In the
second stage, American Indian, African American, Latino, Hmong, and
Somali enrollees were randomly sampled. A total of 8412 enrollees were
assigned randomly to receive a mail survey with no incentive or a $2.00
bill.
Results: The response rate within the SRS after the mail portion was
54% in the incentive group and 45% in the nonincentive group. Response
rates increased considerably with telephone follow-ups. The incentive
SRS response rate increased to 69%, and the nonincentive response rate
increased to 64%. Differences between incentive conditions are more
pronounced after the first mailing (P < 0.01); almost all differences
remained significant (P < 0.05) after the completion of the mail mode.
The inclusion of the $2.00 incentive had similar effects on response
rates and cost across the different racial and ethnic strata, except for
Latino enrollees.
Conclusions: A mixed-mode mail and telephone methodology is effective
for increasing response rates in a Medicaid population overall and
within different racial and ethnic groupings. The effectiveness of this
strategy can be enhanced, in terms of response rate and cost, by
including a $2.00 prepaid incentive.

N2  - Objective: Recruitment of African Americans into health research studies
is a major challenge. This report describes a study of different methods
and strategies to recruit African Americans into a population-based
assessment of cancer behavioral risk factors.
Methods: African Americans ages 18 to 70 years in North Carolina (n =
5,000) were randomly selected from the Department of Motor Vehicle
rosters and assigned at random to one of five different recruitment
strategies based on variations of approach letters (generic versus
culturally sensitive) and inclusion, exclusion, or promise of a small
incentive. Prospective participants were sent an 11-page questionnaire
by mail but could complete it by telephone or Internet as well as by
mail.
Results: The overall response rate was 17.5% (747 completed surveys of
4,276 delivered): 655, 84, and 8 by mail, Internet, and telephone,
respectively. Among eligible respondents, response was significantly
higher for incentive-based than nonincentive strategies; 23.9% for the
generic letter plus incentive compared with 15.8% for the generic
letter only (P < 0.001). The culturally sensitive letter had little
effect on participation (15.8% for both the generic and culturally
sensitive letters). The mean age of eligible respondents was 43.9 years,
41% were male, 37% were college graduates, and 75% were
overweight/obese. There were no differences in respondent
characteristics by assigned recruitment strategy.
Conclusions: Incentive-based strategies yielded the highest survey
responses, whereas a culturally sensitive letter did not appreciably
increase participation among African Americans in North Carolina. This
study adds to what is known about culturally sensitive recruitment
strategies for African Americans and challenges their usefulness in
survey-based studies.

N2  - This study examined why people accepted a demanding rule in a recycling
system that was newly introduced in Nagoya City. We focused on two
social psychological topics: social dilemmas and fairness. While the new
system succeeded in reducing waste, it imposed a burden on citizens
without providing incentives and sanctions. In a research survey, 1442
responses from a sample of 3000 (48% response rate) were obtained using
a stratified sampling method. The results showed that the new recycling
system was approved despite the demands placed on citizens, with a
preference for more strict rules such as penalties and surveillance for
noncompliance. The main determinants of approval of the new recycling
system were social benefit and procedural fairness, whereas the main
determinant of preference for strict rules was outcome fairness. We
argue that (a) social benefit should be emphasized to facilitate
cooperative behavior in a social dilemma situation and (b) the
government should ensure sufficient discussion with citizens and
acknowledgment of their opinions.

N2  - Features of the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program and the
social security retirement system interact to create incentives for
prospective participants in the aged portion of SSI to withdraw from the
labor force and make an early old age insurance (CAI) claim under social
security. This paper takes a first close look at this SSI-OAI
interaction. We first review the. incentives to take early CAI posed by
SSI rules in a basic theoretical framework. The impact of SSI rules on
the financial cost of delaying the initial OAI claim is quantified using
the earnings profiles of actual SSI recipients from Social Security
Administration records. We then examine whether patterns Of first SSI
claims and early OAI claims of SSI-aged participants are consistent with
the incentives identified. Finally, regression tests of behavior
consistent with the predictions of the theory are implemented. The
evidence from these various approaches generally points to behavior that
makes the SSI-OAI interaction plausible and potentially important, and
that is consistent with predicted responses to the incentives for early
retirement in social security created by the interactions of SSI and
OAI. Throughout, the analyses are enhanced by access to Social Security
Administration records that have been matched to individuals in the
Surveys of Income and Program Participation.

N2  - Objectives: (a) To report on response rate and nonresponse bias of a
questionnaire survey of dentists. (b) To make recommendations for future
questionnaire survey research in dentistry. Methods: A questionnaire was
mailed to a stratified systematic sample of 908 Australian dentists. The
strategy included three mailings, a final telephonic contact, university
stationery, paid reply envelopes and personalized correspondence.
Nonresponse bias was assessed by comparing responses to a simple
`yes/no' question from each contact (late responders), and by comparing
demographic information (nonresponders). Results: The response rate
achieved was 87% and there was no evidence of nonresponse bias based on
practice location or year of graduation. The cumulative proportions of
`yes/no' responses essentially remained constant after each contact, but
significantly more late responders answered in the negative to the test
question than did early responders. The telephonic contact aided in the
identification of nonparticipants and ineligible units. Conclusions: The
current survey indicates that differences in data between early and
nonresponders can occur despite there being no demographic differences.
Therefore, assessment of nonresponse bias based on demographic data
alone would seem to be insufficient. Questionnaire survey research must
first be based on sound sampling techniques, and then on achieving as
high a response rate as possible using the many incentives available.

N2  - Background/objectives: The key to HIV/STI control is community-wide
intervention (CWI) which depends heavily on continuous monitoring and
evaluation. Unfortunately, comprehensive CWI assessment methodology and
reports are generally lacking. This study developed, applied, and
evaluated a rapid tool for assessing CWI in China.
Methods: A total of 120 county level respondents in charge of
county-wide responses to HIV/STI thoughout China were selected randomly
and surveyed using a structured inventory consisting of three tiers of
indicators developed via consensus group techniques. The respondents
were asked to rate each of the indicators against a five grade ( 1 - 5)
scale. 30 pairs of the same staff from within Anhui Province were
surveyed to gauge inter-rater reliability.
Results: Response rate for the nationwide survey was 85% and for
inter-rater reliability survey, 90%. Correlation coefficients between
the inter-rater ratings ranged from 0.68 to 0.95. The overall average
rating of CWI in China was 2.85. Average ratings for the six first tier
indicators, organisation and policy development, goals and objectives
setting, project and action planning, resource exploitation, project and
task implementation, and CWI evaluation were 2.87, 2.83, 2.67, 2.77,
3.26, and 2.71 respectively. Ratings derived for the 24 second tier
indicators ranged from 2.1 to 3.86; while for the 96 third tier
indicators, 1.90 to 4.40
Conclusions: The instrument developed proved to be reliable, useful, and
easily applicable in common communities. Application of it in China
revealed that a large gap exists between desired and actual CWI, and
areas meriting particular attention include policy and incentives
development, intervention planning and evaluation, and fund raising and
utilisation.

rapidly escalating costs. This article reports the results of a
preliminary survey conducted in 10 Latin American countries. The study
aimed to document the experiences of different countries in defining and
implementing generic drug,policies, determine the cost of registering
different types of pharmaceutical products and the time needed to
register them, and uncover the incentives governments' have developed to
promote the use of multisource drugs. The survey instrument was,
administered, in person in Chile, Ecuador and Peru and by email in
Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Uruguay.
There was a total of 22 respondents. Survey responses indicated, that
countries use the terms generic and bioequivalence differently. We

N2  - Background The Correction of Myopia Evaluation Trial (COMET), a
randomized, multicenter clinical trial of myopia progression in
children, had an exceptionally high retention rate of 98.5% (462/469)
at three years of follow-up. The present investigation was designed to
evaluate and compare the reasons for COMET's high retention rate
according to participating families and clinical center staff.
Methods Families (n = 411) and staff (n = 35) completed a confidential
19-item questionnaire by indicating families' levels of preference for
each item, and rating its importance in keeping families in the study.
The questionnaire evaluated study features in four categories: staff
characteristics, operational aspects, specific study elements, and
incentives.
Results Results showed that most families viewed the study very
favorably. Features that appealed to 90% or more families and promoted
continued study participation included staff attributes such as
friendliness, responsiveness and encouragement, and aspects pertaining
to standard of care such as completeness of eye exam, quality of eye
care and free eyeglasses. Compared to families, staff tended to
underestimate the importance of the following features for retention:
seeing the same staff at each visit, appointment reminders, center
location, newsletters, commitment to the study, being part of a
nationwide study, length of the study, association with a college of
optometry, completeness of eye exam, and eye drops (p < 0.05 by
chi-square analyses). However, staff responses also revealed less
preferred components of the study protocol (e.g., eye drops), to which
families might have been reluctant to respond unfavorably.
Conclusions Our findings highlight the importance of intangible factors
such as staff attributes and participants' study commitment in
maintaining high retention rates, and the usefulness of surveying both
families and staff.

N2  - The Commute Atlanta program is an instrumented vehicle research program
funded by the FHWA Value Pricing Program and the Georgia Department of
Transportation. A major objective for the multiyear program is to assess
the effects of converting fixed automotive costs into variable driving
costs. The main research hypothesis is that given a per mile pricing
system, participants will modify their driving patterns in an effort to
reduce their total costs, pocketing the savings. The Commute Atlanta
project includes the parallel collection of instrumented vehicle data,
household sociodemographic surveys, 2-day travel diaries, and employer
commute options surveys. The research team will monitor the changes in
driving patterns and will use statistical analyses or household
characteristics, vehicle travel, and relevant employer survey data to
examine the relationships between the incentives offered and subsequent
travel behavior changes. This paper focuses on the recruitment methods
and travel diary response rates for the 2-day diary surveys conducted in
February and March 2004. As in other instrumented vehicle studies,
researchers collected data that allow the comparison of reported diary
travel with monitored vehicle travel. However, this paper focuses on a
new type of comparison. Because the households had been recruited into
the study 8 months before the diary study and their vehicles were
transmitting activity data, the research team could examine whether
there were differences in household vehicle activity between that 77%
of households that completed the diary data collection and the 23% that
did not. The differences were significant at both the high and low ends
of the travel-reporting spectrum and may have some major implications
for evolving household travel survey methods.

N2  - More Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) are requiring written parental
consent in school health intervention trials. Because this requirement
presents a formidable challenge in conducting large-scale research, it
is vital for investigators to share effective strategies learned from
completed trials. Investigators for the recently completed Project
SPLASH (n = 3,716) smoking prevention trial, conducted in 20 Hawaii
middle schools, were required to obtain active parental consent for
three surveys across 2 years. This case study describes the consent
procedures and incentives used in the trial, and their effectiveness.
The overall parental response rate was 85.4%. The highest response rate
(89.5%) came from the 7th grade baseline survey, where project staff
distributed consent materials and provided class-based incentives. In
addition, nearly all students (99.0%) with parental permission assented
to participate in the three surveys. The experiences in this study lead
to several recommendations for future research, including the importance
of assuring adequate funds for recruitment and retention in research
grants.

N2  - Background. Low response rates to surveys are a problem in general
practice. There is evidence that offering GPs incentives improves
response rates to postal questionnaires. However, there is less evidence
about the most effective form of incentive.
Objective. Our trial aimed to maximize response to a postal
questionnaire and to test the most effective form of incentive.
Methods. The study involved a randomized controlled trial of a postal
survey
Results. The incentive of a lottery for six bottles of champagne
generated a response rate of 79%. Furthermore, one chance of six
bottles generated 9% more responses than six chances of one bottle.
Conclusions. This study has established that, among incentives for
postal questionnaires, one big prize improves the yield more than many
small prizes despite the lower odds of winning. It has also confirmed
that offering a modest incentive to GPs generates good response rates
for postal questionnaires.

Organization (WHO) Pilot Health Promoting Hospitals Project from 1993
until 1997, when the Hellenic Network of Health Promoting Hospitals was
established. This study is an overall evaluation of the participation of
Aretaieion Hospital at the HPH Pilot Project. The evaluation comprised
two questionnaire surveys, one among all the professionals, and the
other among the patients involved in the subprojects. At the
professional's survey, the response was 88.6% (39), while at the
patient's survey the response was 62.2% (84). Differences were
identified between the perceptions of the professionals who were
external collaborators and those who were members of the hospital staff.
Problems of the Project were reported to be lack of funding, lack of
time and personnel shortages, lack of health promotion background and
lack of incentives. Major successes were reported to be the personnel
training, the development of collaboration and teamwork, the improvement
of the overall image of the hospital into the community, the improvement
of the working conditions of the personnel. Perception of sustainability
of the projects by health professionals was found to be related to how
interesting they found their subproject and how relevant to the work of
their department. The communication strategy was inadequately planned
and this resulted in some difficulties in developing rapport with the
patients. However, the patients felt that they benefited from the
project, a view also held by the hospital staff professionals.

N2  - Food, water, and worker protection regulations have driven availability,
and loss, of pesticides for use in pest management programs. In
response, public-supported research and extension projects have targeted
investigation and demonstration of reduced-risk integrated pest
management (IPM) techniques, But these new techniques often result in
higher financial burden to the grower, which is counter to the IPM
principle that economic competitiveness is critical to have IPM adopted.
As authorized by the 2002 Farm Bill and administered by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service
(NRCS), conservation programs exist for delivering public-supported
financial incentives to growers to increase environmental stewardship on
lands in production. NRCS conservation programs are described, and the
case for providing financial incentives to growers for implementing IPM
is presented. We also explored the opportunity and challenge to use one
key program, the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), to aid
grower adoption of IPM. The EQIP fund distribution to growers from 1997
to 2002 during the last Far m Bill cycle totaled approximate to$1.05
billion with a portion of funds supporting an NRCS-designed pest
management practice. The average percentage of allocation of EQIP funds
to this pest management practice among states was 0.77 +/- 0.009% (mean
+/- SD). Using Michigan as an example, vegetable and fruit grower
recognition of the program's use to implement IPM was modest (25% of
growers surveyed), and their recognition of its use in aiding
implementation of IPM was improved after educational efforts (74%).
Proposals designed to enhance program usefulness in implementing IPM
were delivered through the NRCS advisory process in Michigan.
Modifications for using the NRCS pest management practice to address
resource concerns were adopted, incentive rates for pest management were
adjusted, and an expanded incentive structure for IPM technique adoption
was tabled for future consideration. The case is strong for using
public-supported financial incentives offered by the EQIP to aid grower
adoption of IPM as a means to address resource concerns, but current use
of the EQIP for this purpose is modest to meager. With appropriate
program adjustments and increased grower awareness, USDA NRCS
conservation programs, and the EQIP in particular, may provide an
important opportunity for growers to increase their use of IPM Lis a
resource conservation and farm management tool.

N2  - Background: Postal questionnaires are an economical and simple method of
data collection for research purposes but are subject to non-response
bias. Several studies have explored the effect of monetary and
non-monetary incentives on response. Recent meta-analyses conclude that
financial incentives are an effective way of increasing response rates.
However, large surveys rarely have the resources to reward individual
participants. Three previous papers report on the effectiveness of
lottery incentives with contradictory results. This study aimed to
determine the effect of including a lottery-style incentive on response
rates to a postal health survey.
Methods: Randomised controlled trial. Setting: North and West
Birmingham. 8,645 patients aged 18 or over randomly selected from
registers of eight general practices (family physician practices).
Intervention: Inclusion of a flyer and letter with a health
questionnaire informing patients that returned questionnaires would be
entered into a lottery-style draw for pound100 of gift vouchers.
Control: Health questionnaire accompanied only by standard letter of
explanation. Main outcome measures: Response rate and completion rate to
questionnaire.
Results: 5,209 individuals responded with identical rates in both groups
(62.1%). Practice, patient age, sex and Townsend score (a postcode
based deprivation measure) were identified as predictive of response,
with higher response related to older age, being female and living in an
area with a lower Townsend score (less deprived).
Conclusion: This RCT, using a large community based sample, found that
the offer of entry into a lottery style draw for pound100 of High Street
vouchers has no effect on response rates to a postal health
questionnaire.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to (a) investigate the extent to which
academic faculty practice plans (FPPs) are currently involved in
ambulatory care quality improvement (QI), (b) describe the structure of
QI initiatives at outpatient FPPs, and (c) delineate facilitators and
barriers to development of FPP outpatient QI initiatives. Members of the
Steering Committee of the Group Practice Council of the University
HealthSystem Consortium (UHC), representing the leadership of 88 FPPs,
were asked to respond to a 38-item Web-based questionnaire during
February and March 2003. The survey elicited information on the
organizational characteristics of FPPs, their current degree of
engagement in outpatient QI activities, and factors driving interest and
barriers impeding efforts to conduct outpatient QI initiatives.
Descriptive statistics for all variables of interest were performed.
Responses were received from 33 participants believed to represent at
least 28 of the total 88 FPP members of the UHC. Nearly all respondents
indicated that some types of outpatient QI initiatives were currently
taking place in their FPP. However, only 12% of respondents met 4 or
more of the 6 criteria deemed to be essential to having a robust
outpatient QI program. Among key QI indicators, one third of respondents
reported that their FPP had a separate and distinct outpatient quality
committee, and some one fifth had a budget for outpatient QI or
financial incentives for outpatient clinics to engage in QI (or both).
The majority of respondents stated that at least some departments in
their FPP were collecting quality data. Most respondents reported that
patient safety and external demand for outpatient QI were the ``more
important{''} factors driving QI efforts, whereas lack of human
resources and other resources were the ``more significant{''} barriers
hindering QI initiatives. The results of the study suggest that,
although FPPs showed a strong interest in outpatient QI initiatives,
FPPs' efforts are still in an infancy phase and lag far behind inpatient
performance measurement activities. Without appropriate resources, it
appears unlikely that FPPs will be able to move the agenda forward to
develop a quality culture and robust program of self-assessment and
improvement in the outpatient setting.

N2  - Introduction: Aviation crashes are a leading cause of occupational
fatalities in Alaska, with Alaskan pilots having nearly 100 times the
fatality rate of U.S. workers overall. A survey was designed to study
pilot and company practices and attitudes in order to develop
intervention strategies that would reduce aviation fatalities. Methods:
Two surveys were administered: one of air carrier operators and one of
active commercial pilots. Surveys from 153 air taxi and public-use
operators were received at a 79% response rate. Results: There are
almost 2000 pilots employed in Alaska during peak season by air taxi
operators and public agencies. Surveyed operators and pilots generally
agreed that improved weather information and regional hazards training
would be effective ways to prevent crashes. Operators were more in favor
of operator financial incentives (p < 0.05) and better pre-employment
hiring checks on pilots (p < 0.05) compared with pilots' survey
responses. There were 48% of pilots of large operators and 73% of
pilots of small operators who considered their jobs to be at least as
safe as other jobs. Conclusions: The results of operator-pilot
comparisons suggest that financial pressures on operators may influence
their views on what measures would be effective in preventing crashes,
and that Alaskan pilots underestimate their occupational fatality risk.

N2  - Background. The factors that determine dialysis modality selection and
distribution are not well understood. Physician reimbursement incentives
have been suggested to play an important role. Under the fee-for-service
system in Ontario that existed prior to July 1998, nephrologists were
paid about sevenfold more for a hemodialysis (HD) patient than for a
patient on peritoneal dialysis (PD). However, since then, nephrologists
have been reimbursed via a modality-independent capitation fee, whereby
payment for any form of dialysis is the same. This was expected to
markedly increase the use of PD.
Methods: When the capitation fee was introduced in 1998, a survey
questionnaire of all Ontario nephrologists was done and repeated 3 years
later (response rate 62.5%). Changes in dialysis modality incidence and
prevalence rates in Ontario and in the rest of Canada were examined.
Results: On a scale of 1 to 7, nephrologists were convinced that the
capitation fee was a good thing (mean rating 6.07); 75% said they had
been seeing patients at every dialysis under the old system, compared to
41% now. Of significance, the proportion of prevalent patients on PD in
Ontario declined from 27.3% in 1997 to 19.7% in 2000, increasing to
22.6% in 2002. Similarly, the incident PD rate seems to have
stabilized, while the use of non-hospital-based HD has increased.
Conclusions: Following the introduction of the capitation fee, PD use in
Ontario continued to decline for 2 years, and then began to increase. In
the rest of Canada, there are continuing declines in PD use. This is
consistent with the hypothesis that the new incentives caused by the
altered physician reimbursement are acting in a subtle way. Perit Dial

N2  - Background. Clinical preventive services improve patient health, and
reminder systems can increase the use of such services. However,
physician organizations often underutilize clinical preventive service
reminders. Little is known about the incentives, capabilities, and
organizational characteristics associated with the use of reminders by
physician organizations.
Methods. The predictors of patient and physician reminder system use
were examined in a sample of 1,104 US physician organizations. The
cross-sectional sample was obtained through a telephone survey with a
70% response rate.
Results. Fifty-one percent of physician organizations used mammogram
reminders, 41% used influenza immunization reminders, and 26% used eye
exam reminders for patients. Eighteen percent of physician organizations
used computer-generated reminders to physicians. Required reporting of
data (P = 0.0006), public recognition for quality (P = 0.0002), and IT
capabilities (P < 0.0001) were strongly associated with patient reminder
use. Medical groups were more likely to use patient-level reminders than
independent practice associations (IPAs) (P < 0.0001). Physician
reminder use was related to required reporting of data (P < 0.0001) and
IT capabilities (P < 0.0001).
Conclusions. Physician organizations have relatively low use of
preventive service reminders to patients and physicians. Offering
quality incentives to physician organizations and improving their IT
capabilities may increase the use of preventive service reminders and
improve the delivery of preventive care. (C) 2004 The Institute For

Study Design and Patient Populations: We conducted a mailed survey, in
both Spanish and English, among women with abnormal Pap smears, who were
members of a large managed care organization. Telephone follow up for
non-responders was performed by a bilingual interviewer. A 20-minute
long distance telephone card was offered as an incentive to individuals
who completed the telephone survey. We used bivariate and multivariate
analyses to describe the population characteristics of respondents who
replied by mail, as compared to those who completed the survey by
telephone.
Results: Of the 1049 potentially eligible participants, 733 women
completed the survey, for an overall response rate of 70%. Fifty-six
percent (N=411) of the surveys were received by mail, and 44% (N=322)
were completed by telephone. Thirty-four percent of the telephone
surveys were completed in Spanish, compared to 13% of the mailed
surveys (P<.001). Telephone respondents were less satisfied with their
health care than were those who responded by mail.
Conclusions: Among this insured cohort of women, Latinas who completed
the survey in Spanish were more likely to participate in a telephone
survey that offered an incentive, than in a mailed survey. These
findings should be considered when planning health surveys in this
population.

N2  - An experiment was conducted to determine the effectiveness of three
invitation and incentive combinations in a web-based survey. A
stratified convenience sample of 434 researchers who were target users
of a collaboratory for earthquake engineering was randomly divided into
three experimental conditions: (a) a $5 bill sent with the survey
instructions via first class mail, (b) a $5 gift certificate code to
Amazon.com sent with the survey instructions via first-class mail, or
(c) a $5 gift certificate code to Amazon.com sent with the survey
instructions via e-mail. Overall response was 43%. Results show that
$5 bills led to significantly higher response rates than either gift
certificate condition (57% for cash vs. 36% for the two gift
certificate conditions, chi(2)(1) = 9.3, p <. 01). This suggests that
cash is a superior incentive for an online survey, even with
technologically sophisticated respondents. This may be due to the
perceived limitations, delayed payoff, or reduced visibility of online
gift certificates.

responses and per-participant costs between a $2 bill and a $250

selected and mailed a survey. Within each group of 288, half received a
$2 bill and the other half received an offer that respondents would be
entered into a drawing to win $250. Nonresponders received a reminder
postcard one week later, and persistent nonresponders received a second
mailing of the survey three weeks after the initial mailing. Results: Of
the 576 surveys that were mailed, nine (2%) subjects were ineligible or
undeliverable, leaving 567 eligible subjects, of whom 301 (53%)
participated in the survey. The $2 bill had a substantially higher
response rate: 170 (56%) of those receiving a $2 bill participated
versus 131 (44%) of those receiving a chance to win $250 (95%
confidence interval = 5% to 22%; p < 0.001). The $2 bill offer was
less expensive per participant than the $250 offer. The cost of postage
and incentives was $997.33 for 170 participants, or $5.87 per
participant, for the $2 bill and $979.29 for 131 participants, or
$7.48 per participant, for the chance to win $250. Conclusions:
Mailing a $2 bill incentive produces a better response rate with lower
cost per participant than offering a chance to win $250.

N2  - The Swedish Economist Assar Lindbeck has recently expressed concern that
PhD programs are not educating enough ``two-legged{''} economists. We
surveyed all PhD students enrolled at Stockholm University and the
Stockholm School of Economics-strong European graduate programs that
have adopted the US-style curriculum. The survey response rate was 73
percent, so we place great confidence in the admittedly limited
information that the survey does provide: Students enter with a
relatively broad academic background, an interest in the social
sciences, and a desire to serve the community. They do not enter
graduate school with a primary interest in statistics or mathematical
work. They find that incentives within the program do not encourage
participation in the policy debate. To the extent that new PhDs are
``one-legged{''} economists, it is not because they entered graduate
school that way. Our results are remarkably similar to the results of
the 1985 survey conducted by David Colander and Arjo Klamer. We consider
the possibility that in each case the process that generates
expectations of those entering had not caught up to the changes,
resulting in palpable dissatisfaction among the currently enrolled
students.

N2  - Context. Despite widespread publicity of consumer-directed health plans,
little is known about their prevalence and the extent to which their
designs adequately reflect and support consumerism.
Objective. We examined three types of consumer-directed health plans:
health reimbursement accounts (HRAs), premium-tiered, and point-of-care
tiered benefit plans. We sought to measure the extent to which these
plans had diffused, as well as to provide a critical look at the ways in
which these plans support consumerism. Consumerism in this context
refers to efforts to enable informed consumer choice and consumers'
involvement in managing their health. We also wished to determine
whether mainstream health plans-health maintenance organization (HMO),
point of service (POS), and preferred provider organization (PPO)
models-were being influenced by consumerism.
Data Sources/Study Setting. Our study uses national survey data
collected by Mercer Human Resource Consulting from 680 national and
regional commercial health benefit plans on HMO, PPO, POS, and
consumer-directed products.
Study Design. We defined consumer-directed products as health benefit
plans that provided (1) consumer incentives to select more economical
health care options, including self-care and no care, and (2)
information and support to inform such selections. We asked health plans
that offered consumer-directed products about 2003 enrollment, basic
design features, and the availability of decision support. We also asked
mainstream health plans about their activities that supported
consumerism (e.g., proactive outreach to inform or influence enrollee
behavior, such as self-management or preventive care, reminders sent to
patients with identified medical conditions.)
Data Collection/Extraction Methods. We analyzed survey responses for all
four product lines in order to identify those plans that offer health
reimbursement accounts (HRAs), premium-tiered, or point-of-care tiered
models as well as efforts of mainstream health plans to engage informed
consumer decision making.
Principal findings. The majority of enrollees in consumer-directed
health plans are in tiered models (primarily point-of-care tiered
networks) rather than HRAs. Tiers are predominantly determined based on
both cost and quality criteria. Enrollment in HRAs has grown
substantially, in part because of the entry of mainstream managed care
plans into the consumer-directed market. Health reimbursement accounts,
tiered networks, and traditional managed care plans vary in their
capacity to support consumers in managing their health risks and
selection of provider and treatment options, with HRAs providing the
most and mainstream plans the least.
Conclusion. While enrollment in consumer-directed health plans continues
to grow steadily, it remains a tiny fraction of all employer-sponsored
coverage. Decision support in these plans, a critical link to help
consumers make more informed choices, is also still limited. This lack
may be of concern in light of the fact that only a minority of such
plans report that they monitor claims to protect against underuse.
Tiered benefit models appear to be more readily accepted by the market
than HRAs. If they are to succeed in optimizing consumers' utility from
health benefit spending, careful attention needs to be paid to how well
these models inform consumers about the consequences of their
selections.

N2  - Objective: Improving response rates, particularly among physicians, is
important to minimize nonresponder bias and increase the effective
sample size in epidemiologic research. We conducted a randomized trial
to examine the impact of prepayment vs. postpayment incentives on
response rates.
Study Design and Setting: Self-completion postal questionnaires were
mailed to 949 physicians who were respondents to an earlier survey and
representative of the general physician population in Hong Kong. These
physicians were randomly allocated to receive a HK$20 cash prepayment
incentive that accompanied the survey (n = 474) or a postpayment reward
of the same amount on receipt of the completed questionnaire (n = 475).
Results: The final prepayment response rate was 82.9%, compared with
72.5% in the postpayment arm (P <.001). Of the eight alternative
incentive and follow-up strategies evaluated, three lie on the
efficiency frontier (i.e., not dominated), including postpayment with
three mailings at HK$42.7, prepayment with three mailings at HK$66.5
and prepayment with three mailings and telephone follow-up at HK$112.1
per responder recruited (US$1 = HK$7.8).
Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that prepayment cash incentives are
superior to postpayment of the equivalent amount in improving response
rates among a representative sample of Hong Kong physicians. Further
research should concentrate on confirming the generalizability of these
findings in other health care occupation groups and settings. (C) 2004

N2  - Using farm-level survey data from Ethiopia, this paper estimates a
quadratic restricted profit function to assess the supply response of
smallholder farmers. All major crops are identified in the analysis and
variations in agro-climatic and farming systems are accounted for.
Peasant farmers, at least in the more commercial Central and Southern
zones, do respond positively and significantly to price incentives.
Farmers in the Northern zone are least commercial and least responsive
to prices, and in fact the model based on profit maximisation does not
adequately capture their behaviour. In general, non-price factors,
especially rainfall and market access, are more important than prices in
affecting production, and which factors are most important varies
depending on the crop and region in question. We conclude with
suggestions regarding which crops appear most suitable to each
agro-climatic region, and identify the most relevant policy
interventions in each case.

establish whether the incentive of being entered into a prize draw to
win a personal digital assistant (PDA) would increase the response rate

Methods: a randomised controlled trial was conducted. This involved
sending a postal questionnaire to all Consultant Obstetricians and

receiving a questionnaire offering a prize draw incentive (on response)
or no such incentive.
Results: The response rate for recipients offered the prize incentive
was 64% (461/716) and 62% (429/694) in the no incentive group
(relative rate of response. 1.04, 95% CI 0.96-1.13).

N2  - The present study was designed to obtain a comprehensive view of the
dysphagia assessment practice patterns of speech-language pathologists
and their opinion on the importance of these practices using survey
methods and taking into consideration clinician, patient, and
practice-setting variables. A self-administered mail questionnaire was
developed following established methodology to maximize response rates.
Eight dysphagia experts independently rated the new survey for content
validity. Test-retest reliability was assessed with a random sample of
23 participants. The survey was sent to 50 speech-language pathologists
randomly selected from the Canadian professional association database of
members who practice in dysphagia. Surveys were mailed according to the
Dillman Total Design Method and included an incentive offer. High survey
(64%) and item response (95%) rates were achieved and clinicians were
reliable reporters of their practice behaviors (ICC > 0.60). Of all the
clinical assessment items, 36% were reported with high (> 80%)
utilization and 24% with low (< 20%) utilization, the former
pertaining to tongue motion and vocal quality after food/fluid intake
and the latter to testing of oral sensation without food. One-third
(33%) of instrumental assessment items were highly utilized and
included assessment of bolus movement and laryngeal response to bolus
misdirection. Overall, clinician experience and teaching institutions
influenced greater utilization. Opinions of importance were similar to
utilization behaviors (r = 0.947, p = 0.01). Of all patients referred
for dysphagia assessment, full clinical assessments were administered to
71% of patients but instrumental assessments to only 36%. A
hierarchical model of practice behavior is proposed to explain this
pattern of progressively decreasing item utilization.

N2  - A framework on worker motivations is tested with an extensive US survey;
82.7% of the respondents report that they are very likely to keep an
agreement to work hard, even if it was almost impossible for their
employer to monitor them. Based on mean responses, the rank order of
motivations is moral, intrinsic, peer pressure, and positive incentives.
Respondents also report that fairness considerations are important and
that they are especially likely to keep agreements with honest
employers. Logit analysis indicates that increases in moral and
intrinsic motivations increase the likelihood of keeping agreements to
provide effort. The evidence suggests that we might need to reexamine a
foundational assumption underlying the theory of the firm. (C) 2004

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Understanding the roles and responsibilities of physicians
who manage mutual patients is important for assuring good patient care.
Among physicians expressing a preference to involve a neurologist in the
care of a patient, we evaluated agreement between neurologists and
primary care physicians for the extent of specialty involvement in the
evaluation and management of the patient, and the factors influencing
those preferences.
DESIGN AND SETTING: A self-administered survey containing 3 clinical
scenarios was developed with the assistance of a multispecialty advisory
board and mailed to a stratified probability sample of physicians.
PARTICIPANTS: Six hundred and eight family physicians, 624 general
internists, and 492 neurologists in 9 U.S. states.
INTERVENTIONS: For each scenario, those respondents who preferred
involvement of a specialist were asked about the preferred extent of
that involvement: one-time consultation with and without test/medication
ordering, consultation and limited follow-up, or taking over ongoing
care of the specialty problem as long as it persists.
MAIN RESULTS: Survey response rate was 60%. For all 3 scenarios,
neurologists preferred a greater extent of specialty involvement
compared to primary care physicians (all P < .05). Other physician and
practice characteristic factors, including financial incentives, had
lesser or no influence on the extent of specialty involvement preferred.
CONCLUSIONS: The disagreement between primary care physicians and
specialists regarding the preferred extent of specialist involvement in
the care of patients with neurological conditions should raise serious
concerns among health care providers, policy makers, and educators about
whether mutual patient care is coordinated and appropriate.

N2  - Context: Many states attempt to entice young generalist physicians into
rural and medically underserved areas with financial support-for-service
programs-scholarships, service-option loans, loan repayment, direct
financial incentives, and resident support programs-with little
documentation of their effectiveness.
Objective: The objective of this study was to assess outcomes of states'
support-for-service programs as a group and to compare outcomes of the 5
program types.
Design: We conducted a cross-sectional, primarily descriptive study.
Participants: We studied all 69 state programs operating in 1996 that
provided financial support to medical students, residents, and
practicing physicians in exchange for a period of service in underserved
areas; federally funded initiatives were excluded. We also surveyed 434
generalist physicians who served in 29 of these state programs and a
matched comparison group of 723 nonobligated young generalist
physicians.
Data Collection: Information on eligible programs was collected by
telephone, mail questionnaires, and from secondary sources. Obligated
and nonobligated physicians were surveyed, with 80.3% and 72.8%
response rates, respectively.
Main Outcome Measures: Levels of socioeconomic need of communities and
patients served by physicians, programs' participant service completion
and retention rates, and physicians' satisfaction levels.
Results: Compared with young nonobligated generalists, physicians
serving obligations to state programs practiced in demonstrably needier
areas and cared for more patients insured under Medicaid and uninsured
(48.5% vs. 28.5%, P < 0.001). Service completion rates were uniformly
high for loan repayment, direct incentive, and resident-support programs
(93% combined) but lower for student-targeting service-option loan
(mean, 44.7%) and scholarship (mean, 66.5%) programs. State-obligated
physicians were more satisfied than nonobligated physicians, and 9 of 10
indicated that they would enroll in their programs again. Obligated
physicians also remained longer in their practices than nonobligated
physicians (P = 0.03), with respective group retention rates of 71%
versus 61% at 4 years and 55% versus 52% at 8 years. Retention rates
were highest for loan repayment, direct incentive, and loan programs.
Conclusions: States' support-for-service programs bring physicians to
needy communities where a strong majority work happily and with at-risk
patient populations; half stay over 8 years. Loan repayment and direct
financial incentive programs demonstrate the broadest successes.

N2  - Objective: To describe the practice settings, financial arrangements,
and management strategies experienced by generalist physicians and
identify factors associated with reporting pressure to limit referrals,
pressure to see more patients, and career dissatisfaction.
Design: Cross-sectional mail survey.
Participants and Setting: Six hundred nineteen generalist physicians
(62% response rate) caring for managed care patients in 3 Minnesota
health plans during 1999.
Measurements and Main Results: Twenty-six percent of physicians reported
pressure to limit referrals. In adjusted analyses, female physicians and
those who were board certified acted as gatekeepers for most of their
patients, received incentives based on performance reports and quality
profiles, and received direct income from capitation, and were more
likely than others to report this pressure (all P<.05). Sixty-two
percent reported pressure to see more patients. In adjusted analyses,
this pressure was more frequent among physicians in practices owned by
health systems, those using physician extenders, and among physicians
paid by salary with performance adjustment or those receiving at least
some capitation (all P<.05). One-quarter (24%) of physicians were
dissatisfied with their career in medicine. In adjusted analyses,
physicians reporting pressure to limit referrals (risk ratio, 1.12; 95%
confidence interval, 1.01 to 1.19) and those reporting pressure to see
more patients (risk ratio, 1.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.08 to 1.66)
were more likely to be dissatisfied than other physicians.
Conclusions: Pressures to limit referrals and to see more patients are
common, particularly among physicians paid based on productivity or
capitation, and they are associated with career dissatisfaction. Whether
future changes in practice arrangements or compensation strategies can
decrease such physician-reported pressures, and ultimately improve
physician satisfaction, will be an important area for future study.

breastfeeding support policies and practices within Colorado businesses.
Only 28.2% of survey respondents reported that their organization
provided breastfeeding support services. However, the majority of
businesses did offer benefits and services conducive to breastfeeding.
There was a low frequency of positive responses related to incentives
for increasing the provision of breastfeeding support services. The
incentives receiving the highest frequency of positive responses were
those related to employer benefits and needs, such as provision of
information on successful breastfeeding support programs within similar
organizations; provision of information on the benefits of breastfeeding
to employers, including cost savings; and availability of tax credits
for providing breastfeeding support services. Multiple approaches are
indicated for increasing work-site breastfeeding support and for
removing barriers to the achievement of Healthy People 2010
breastfeeding objectives for employed mothers.

N2  - Background: Historically, achieving a high response rate on physician
surveys has been a challenging task. Given such concerns, understanding
research strategies that facilitate adequate response rates is
important. Primary care physician responses to a mail survey oil smoking
cessation are summarized by physician specialty and timing of incentive.
Methods: A stratified random-sample design, stratified by patient
populations-adults, adolescents, and pregnant women-was used. The
sampling frame included New Jersey internists, general practitioners,
family physicians, pediatricians, and obstetrician-gynecologists. A
total of 2100 physicians, 700 physicians from each patient strata, were
sampled and mailed a smoking-cessation survey in summer 2002. The sample
was randomized by incentive timing: Half received the incentive (i.e.,
$25 gift card) with the first survey mailing, and half received the
incentive on receipt of their completed survey.
Results: The promised-incentive group achieved a significantly lower
response rate (56%) compared with the up-front-incentive group
(71.5%). Response rates by medical specialty varied overall and within
incentive groups. The difference between the incentive groups was
greatest among obstetrician-gynecologists (i.e., 20.2 percentage points)
and was least among pediatricians (i.e., 5.8 percentage points).
Conclusions: Physician response rates to mail surveys are greatly
improved, especially among certain medical specialties, by using
up-front incentives.

N2  - Increasing mail survey response using monetary incentives is a proven,
but not always cost-effective, method in every population. This paper
tackles the questions of whether it is worth using monetary incentives
and the size of the inducement by testing a regression model of the
impact of prepaid monetary incentives on response rates in consumer and
organizational mail surveys. The results support their use and show that
the inducement value makes a significant impact on the effect size.
Importantly, no significant differences were found between consumer and
organizational populations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Drug testing was used as an adjunct to a general population household
drug use survey administered via audio computer assisted self-interview.
Participants, ages 18-40 years residing in Chicago, were recruited to
participate in three different biological tests (hair, oral fluid, and
urine) presented in random order subsequent to completing an interview.
Subjects had the option of participating in zero to three different
tests. We examined participation/refusal in tests, reaction to testing
requests, as well as variables associated with participation and
reaction. Subjects were randomly assigned to a low (US$ 10 per test) or
high (US$ 20 per test) incentive condition. Over 90% of the sample
participated in at least one test, usually the oral fluid test.
Associations between refusal status and two variables, socioeconomic
status (SES) and presence of children in the household, provided partial
support for the notion that drug test participation parallels the survey
response process in general. Incentive level did not directly increase
drug test participation. Reporting of recent illicit drug use was
associated with participation in only one procedure, hair testing. Type
of test offered and individual differences in willingness to be drug
tested were important predictors of drug test refusal and subject
reaction to testing requests. Compared with urine and hair testing, oral
fluid testing had lower refusal rates and was generally more acceptable
to respondents in a general population survey. The findings support the
feasibility of incorporating multiple drug tests with modest incentives
into general population household surveys on drug abuse. (C) 2003

N2  - Background: Striking increases in the prevalence and morbidity of asthma
among inner city children have been documented.
Objective: To establish and evaluate a large-scale, school-based
case-detection process designed to efficiently and reliably identify
inner city children with asthma.
Methods: A bilingual, seven-question, self-administered, parental asthma
screening survey was developed. Clinical validation was achieved in a
sample of 675 consecutive parents bringing a child to the school-based
Breathmobile Program for initial evaluation, using a comprehensive
evaluation by a physician specialist (ie, allergist) as the standard.
Survey response patterns were used to construct a novel seven-model,
tiered scoring algorithm and an abbreviated algorithm that predict the
probability of a child being clinically classified as ``yes asthma{''}
or ``no asthma.{''} A systematic survey distribution process
administered by a single coordinator was developed, and the impact of a
classroom-oriented incentive offering a $25 school supply gift
certificate for survey return rates of greater than or equal to 80% was
evaluated.
Results: A total of 636 parents provided one or more survey responses
and information sufficient for clinical classification. The scoring
algorithm correctly identified children with asthma (greater than or
equal to 80% probability) with a sensitivity of 86.5%, a specificity
of 83.6%, and a misclassification rate of 14.3% (91 of 636 children).
The sensitivity for identifying persistent asthma was 91.3%. Asthma
prevalence estimates derived using survey results from a larger sampling
of the general population were similar to rates previously reported for
comparable populations. The inclusion of an inexpensive incentive
increased the median survey return rates from 35.3 to 65% (z = -11.9; p
< .001). The screening process has been used to conduct 27,526 surveys
at inner city schools.
Conclusions: The Breathmobile case-detection process offers a validated,
comprehensive, large-scale method with which to identify children with
asthma at their school sites.

N2  - During the last decade there has been a dramatic increase in the both
the number and the rate of Mexican naturalization. Some have interpreted
this increase as a response to changes in welfare and immigration policy
surrounding the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity
Reconciliation Act (PRWORA), which limited public assistance to
noncitizens, and the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant
Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), which may have increased the incentive to
naturalize by making it more difficult for legal immigrants to sponsor
their relatives for entry to the United States. This article uses
Current Population Survey data from 1994/95 and 2000/01 to examine how
the social and economic determinants of naturalization may have changed
in order to provide insight into which explanation for the increase in
naturalizations is most relevant. We find that while the proportion of
Mexican immigrants who are naturalized increased during the 1990s, their
determinants have remained largely the same with e exception that those
with noncitizen spouses have become more likely to be naturalized in the
post-reform period. This suggests that a more cautious interpretation be
taken about the relationship between the increase in naturalizations and
welfare and sponsorship restrictions, particularly when regarding
Mexican immigrants.

N2  - Background: The influence of payment mechanisms on physician decisions
is not well understood.
Objectives: The objective of this study was to test 2 null hypotheses:
1) physicians' clinical decisions would not be influenced by payment
incentives; and 2) physicians would have equal concern about medical
decisions made under capitation or fee-for-service (FFS) arrangements.
Research Design: We conducted a physician survey in which patient
insurance status (capitated or FFS) was randomly incorporated into 4
clinical scenarios using a Latin square design.
Subjects: We used a nationally representative random sample of family
physicians in direct patient care.
Measures: We used treatment decisions and physician ``bother{''} scores
(a measure of discomfort about decisions) in response to the clinical
scenarios and adjusted for physician gender, age, board certification,
income, practice location, practice mix, practice setting, geographic
region, local area managed care penetration, and capitation or risk pool
contracts in practice.
Results: Seventy-two percent of sampled physicians responded. Comparing
decisions made under capitation to FFS, physicians were less likely to
indicate they would perform discretionary care (relative risks {[}RR]
range, .64-.82; P <0.001), but payment had no effect on selection of
life-saving care (RR, 1.02, not significant). Physicians felt
significantly more ``bothered{''} when they made clinical decisions
under capitatedpayment (P <0.001 in all scenarios), regardless of
whether a treatment was discretionary or life-saving, and whether the
decision was made for or against the treatment (P <0.001).
Conclusions: Payment mechanism has significant effects on clinical
decision-making. Reduction of resources spent for discretionary care
might be achieved under capitated arrangements; however, physicians
respond with greater levels of discomfort under capitation than FFS.

N2  - Board certification of pharmacists has been a reality in the United
States since 1976, when the Board of Pharmaceutical Specialties (BPS)
was founded. Little has been reported about the effects of board
certification of pharmacists, particularly pharmacy practice faculty,
since 1992, when the BPS administered its first certification
examination. We developed and pretested a survey to describe and measure
the effect of BPS certification on the realm of academia as perceived by
deans of colleges of pharmacy in the United States. Deans or other
appropriate officials at all 84 colleges of pharmacy in the United
States were asked to complete and submit this 13-question survey, which
was administered through the Web and maintained respondents' anonymity.
Officials from 35 of the 84 colleges completed the survey, for a
response rate of 42%. No college reported that board certification was
a condition for employment. Eight schools (23%) anticipated a
certification requirement in the future. The most commonly reimbursed
items associated with certification were fees for the American College
of Clinical Pharmacy preparatory course and the BPS examination. Twelve
schools (34%) provided no reimbursement toward certification. The most
common incentive for faculty to obtain certification was consideration
in promotion and tenure (66%). We believe that this information will
facilitate efforts to gauge the effects of BPS certification on colleges
of pharmacy We also anticipate that it will assist colleges as they
attempt to recruit and retain the most qualified faculty members
possible, particularly in light of the national pharmacist shortage.

N2  - While a low survey response rate may indicate that the risk of
nonresponse error is high, we know little about when nonresponse causes
such error and when nonresponse is ignorable. Leverage-salience theory
of survey participation suggests that when the survey topic is a factor
in the decision to participate, noncooperation will cause nonresponse
error. We test three hypotheses derived from the theory: (1) those faced
with a survey request on a topic of interest to them cooperate at higher
rates than do those less interested in the topic; (2) this tendency for
the ``interested{''} to cooperate more readily is diminished when
monetary incentives are offered; and (3) the impact of interest on
cooperation has nonignorability implications for key statistics. The
data come from a three-factor experiment examining the impact on
cooperation with surveys on (a) five different topics, using (b) samples
from five different populations that have known attributes related to
the topics, with (c) two different incentive conditions.

N2  - Mailed surveys are widely used to collect epidemiological and health
service data on cancer populations. Nonresponse can threaten the
validity of surveys and various strategies, including the enclosure of
modest incentives, are often used to increase response rates. A study
was undertaken to determine whether response rate to a mailed survey
differed with provision of immediate versus delayed incentives. A
six-page mailed survey to ascertain dietary supplement use was sent to
1402 men who had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. Subjects were
block randomized into two groups based on age (:565 years versus >65
years), race (white versus nonwhite), and disease status (locoregional
versus distant). One group received a 30-min prepaid phone card
concurrently with their blank survey (unconditional incentive), whereas
the other group received the incentive only on receipt of their
completed survey (conditional incentive). A 60% overall response rate
was achieved, and no differences in response rates were noted between
conditional and unconditional incentive groups (overall, as well as
within defined age, race, and disease-defined strata). Nonwhites,
however, were significantly less likely to respond than whites (P <
0.0001). In conclusion, acceptable response rates to a mailed survey can
be achieved in a general population of cancer survivors using modest
incentives. Given no differences in response rates using conditional
versus unconditional incentives, the decision to provide immediate
versus delayed incentives is one that should be considered on a
study-specific basis, and a decision based primarily on cost. Other
means, however, appear necessary to achieve acceptable response rates
among minority group cancer survivors.

N2  - This study examines the effect of the timing of follow-ups, different
incentives, length, and presentation of the questionnaire on the
response rate and response quality in an online experimental setting.
The results show that short questionnaires have a higher response rate,
although long questionnaires still generate a surprisingly high
response. Furthermore, vouchers seem to be the most effective incentive
in long questionnaires, while lotteries are more efficient in short
surveys. A follow-up study revealed that lotteries with small prizes,
but a higher chance of winning are most effective in increasing the
response rate. Enhancing questionnaires with visual elements, such as
product images, lead to a higher response quality and generate
interesting interaction effects with the length of the questionnaire and
the incentives used. Finally, the timing of the follow-up has no
significant influence on the response rate.

N2  - Surveys are one of the most frequent modes of observation and measurement. Survey research can be exploratory, descriptive, and/or explanatory. Modes of survey administration vary and include face-to-face, telephone, mail, and Internet. There are numerous considerations that that must be taken into account when designing and conducting a survey. Deciding what information is needed and why is important when developing questions for a survey; it is essential to define the purpose of the survey and to be as specific as possible in terms of the data to be collected. Response rate varies by target audience and is influenced by a number of factors such as incentives, survey length, and perceived burden. From question development to survey construction, the goal is to minimize measurement error with systematic planning and execution.
