Abstract = {{This article analyzes selection incentives for insurers in the Dutch
   basic health insurance market, which operates with community-rated
   premiums and sophisticated risk adjustment. Selection incentives result
   from the interplay of three market characteristics: possible actions by
   insurers, consumer response to these actions, and predictable variation
   in profitability of insurance contracts. After a qualitative analysis of
   the first two characteristics our primary objective is to identify the
   third. Using a combination of claims data (N= 16.8 million) and survey
   information (N= 387,195), we find substantial predictable variation in
   profitability. On average, people in good health are profitable, while
   those in poor health are unprofitable. We conclude that Dutch insurers
   indeed face selection incentives. A complete measure of selection
   incentives, however, captures the correlation between individual-level
   profitability and consumer response to insurer-actions. Obtaining
   insight in this correlation is an important direction for further
   research.}},

Title = {{Paramedical students' perceptions of research: a survey}},
Journal = {{CURRENT MEDICAL RESEARCH AND OPINION}},
Abstract = {{Background There is a general perception that research is underdeveloped
   in rehabilitation professions. However, a PubMed search found that the
   growth in publications in the rehabilitation field was twice that of the
   general medical field. Despite this growth, another study focusing on
   Europe found that the proportion of articles reporting on clinical
   research in the rehabilitation field remained low (less than 40\% of
   articles). This could be due to lack of teaching about research in
   rehabilitation schools or the late introduction of such courses. Aims
   Describe the students' perceptions of research: their desire to conduct
   research, the usefulness of research and research competence. Methods
   Questionnaire survey targeting all French paramedical students (speech
   therapy, occupational therapy, psychomotricity, audiometry,
   physiotherapy, orthoptics) in their final year of study in 2018-2019.
   Results Overall, 791 students completed the full survey representing a
   response rate of 36.3\% of the students contacted. Only 34.3\% of
   rehabilitation students were willing to conduct research despite finding
   it useful (98.6\%). The main barrier was the preference for their core
   operational work (cited 444 times, representing 17.6\% of citations).
   There was a significant relation between perceived competence and the
   attractiveness of research: 84\% of the students not interested in
   research felt they were not competent to conduct research but this
   figure dropped to 57.6\% amongst the students interested in research (OR
   4.0; 95\% CI 2.9-5.6). Using a multivariate analysis, we confirmed that
   the main incentive was feeling competent, as well as past contact with
   research and supervisors who promoted research work. Conclusion Students
   have little contact with research during their internships, low
   perceived competence and, consequently, little desire to conduct
   research.}},

Journal = {{EVALUATION \& THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS}},
Abstract = {{While collecting high quality data from physicians is critical, response
   rates for physician surveys are frequently low. A proven method for
   increasing response in mail surveys is to provide a small, prepaid

   the amount of a first (\$5 or \$10) and second (\$0, \$5, or \$10)
   incentive to form the following groups: Group \$5/\$5; Group \$5/\$10;
   Group \$10/\$0; Group \$10/\$5; and Group \$10/\$10. Overall, second
   incentives were associated with higher response rates and lower costs

Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{5, SI}},

Abstract = {{Context: There is limited research on what factors are most salient to
   implementation of evidence-based practices (EBPs) among public health
   agencies in public health emergency preparedness and response (PHPR) and
   under what conditions EBP implementation will occur. Objective: This
   study assessed the conditions, barriers, and enablers affecting EBP
   implementation among the PHPR practice community and identified
   opportunities to support EBP implementation. Design: A Web-based survey
   gathered information from public health agencies. Data obtained from 228
   participating agencies were analyzed. Setting: State, local, and
   territorial public health agencies across the United States.
   Participants: Preparedness program officials from 228 public health
   agencies in the United States, including Public Health Emergency
   Preparedness (PHEP) cooperative agreement awardees (PHEP awardees) and a
   random sample of local health departments (LHDs). Results: Respondents
   indicated that EBP is necessary and improves PHPR functions and tasks
   and that staff are interested in improving skills for EBP
   implementation. Top system-level barriers to EBP implementation were
   insufficient funding, lack of EBP, and lack of clarity regarding which
   practices are evidence based. PHEP awardees were significantly more
   likely to report a lack of EBP in the field, whereas LHDs were
   significantly more likely to report a lack of incentives. The top
   organizational-level barrier was insufficient staff. Most respondents
   indicated their agency culture supports EBP; however, LHDs were
   significantly more likely to report a lack of support from supervisors
   and leadership. Few respondents reported individual barriers to EBP
   implementation. Conclusions: Findings indicate an opportunity to improve
   dissemination strategies, communication efforts, and incentives to
   support EBP implementation in PHPR. Potential strategies include
   improving awareness of and accessibility to EBPs through targeted
   dissemination efforts; building organizational capacity to support EBP
   implementation, particularly staff capacity, knowledge, and skills; and
   identifying funding and incentives to promote EBP uptake and
   sustainment.}},

Title = {{Car-sharing intention analysis in Japan by comparing the utility of car
   ownership for car-owners and non-car owners}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORT POLICY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{1-14}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Car sharing (CS) service has grown as one of the components of
   multimodal mobility in urban transport and it is expected to lead to a
   reduction in personal car ownership, thereby mitigating urban congestion
   and parking demand. It also provides last-mile mobility to complement
   public transport. Against this backdrop, a lot of studies have been
   conducted to make clear the effectiveness of CS services. However, most
   of the previous studies were surveys aimed at current CS users, and only
   a few studies have evaluated whether general car owners and non-owners
   might become members of CS services in the future.
   In this study, a survey was conducted among 1000 car owners in Japan as
   to whether CS services would induce them to stop owning a car. At the
   time of the survey, the respondents' current annual cost of owning a car
   was automatically displayed by calculating the amount from previous
   answers about their attributes. With this questionnaire method, it is
   presumed that respondents answered with a stronger awareness of the high
   cost of car ownership, so their responses might have reflected a
   consideration of the economic benefits of CS services. The results
   showed that 74\% of car owners answered that they would not stop owning
   a car no matter how inexpensive CS services were and even if there was
   no risk of vehicle unavailability. The percentage was almost the same in
   every range of household income, and 40\% said the reason was
   familiarity with and attachment to a car and 54\% cited convenience in
   emergencies. These results suggest that in order to spread CS services
   for further reducing personal car ownership, emotional incentives are
   required to compensate for certain disadvantages of CS services, e.g.,
   the lack of excitement derived from car ownership, potential
   non-availability in emergencies, and so on.
   A survey was also conducted among 1000 non-car owners in order to
   analyze and compare the utility of car ownership. The results showed
   that the perceived utility of car ownership was 2-10 times greater for
   owners than for non-owners. CS service providers and urban transport
   policymakers should be aware of this value when designing businesses and
   policies. Consideration should also be given to the various objectives
   of CS services such as between aiming to reducing car ownership and
   aiming to improve urban transport for non-car owners. Further research
   is required to optimize CS services for efficient urban transport
   design.}},

Abstract = {{Ethnic settlement patterns and other forms of everyday interethnic

   Previous studies on this topic have come to rival conclusions, with some
   finding that increased intergroup contact and residential mixing produce
   a corresponding increase in support for tribune parties and others
   finding the opposite. This study uses a combination of data from
   elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly from 1998 to 2017 and survey
   data from 2016 to evaluate these rival arguments and assess the extent
   to which the broader institutional and demographic context in which
   political competition takes place condition responses to intergroup
   contact. Our findings indicate that voters in both declining and
   ascending demographic groups respond similarly to intergroup contact,
   expressing less support for tribune parties in contexts where
   residential patterns and social networks provide more opportunities for
   intergroup contact. These results highlight the conditional nature of
   the effectiveness of consensus-based institutions in divided societies:
   they can create incentives for moderation, but those incentives are most
   likely to be realized in contexts where rival groups experience a high

Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{157-183}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Electricity generation in the United States is rapidly moving towards
   integrating more renewables into the system due to several factors,
   including cost competitiveness, consumer preferences, and state and
   federal policies, such as production and income tax incentives,
   renewable portfolio standards (RPSs), and state level subsidies for
   solar energy. While these policies have been researched comprehensively,
   in this paper we investigate consumer preference and willingness to pay
   toward renewable energy. Consumer preferences may impact the type of
   renewable energy utilized, as well as state-determined RPS requirements.
   We implement a choice experiment survey to gain understanding of
   consumer preferences and their preference heterogeneity. We conduct the
   survey in New Mexico, a state with RPS and great potential for
   renewables, particularly in solar where it ranks third in the U.S. for
   that potential. Focusing on the consumers of the state's major utility,
   our choice experiment considers an increase in renewable energy and
   preference for different types of solar energy (rooftop solar and solar
   farm). We control for location heterogeneity (i.e., rural vs. urban), as
   well as exposure to solar installations. Utilizing multinomial logit and
   random parameter logit our results suggest respondents support an
   increased RPS solar requirement and they have a positive marginal
   willingness to pay (MWTP) for rooftop solar and smart meter
   installation. These values are impacted by several factors, including
   location and exposure to solar. We also observe a distance decay effect
   on respondents' MWTP for different solar plans. For regulators
   considering additional RPS levels, or utilities considering solar
   installations, the results provide improved information on consumer
   preferences, heterogeneity of response, and MWTP for solar energy.}},

   responses to a farmer survey conducted in a region suffering a lack of
   younger successors. The analysis, based on descriptive statistics and
   logistic regression models, highlighted the importance of income as a
   factor encouraging succession. Logistic regression models showed that
   the number of family members employed, the farm size, the farm's annual
   income, and incentives for succession are main factors that influence
   expectation of a successor in the family farming succession process. The
   identification of these factors provided important insights for the

Abstract = {{Payments for ecosystem services (PES) have been initiated throughout
   Brazil to encourage forest restoration on private lands, especially
   smaller properties that are out of compliance with national land use
   laws requiring conservation of native vegetation. A choice experiment of
   189 farmers in the Cantareira region - the drinking water source for

   that existing PES contract incentives are unlikely to spur enrollment by
   landowners with small properties and high dependence on agricultural
   income. This group is unlikely to restore forest without compensation,
   and survey responses indicate they need a much higher payment than
   current payment structures provide. Our results also provide support for
   the inclusion of in-kind incentives that increase agricultural
   productivity as a means to encourage participation. These findings are

   Conviction Databank}},
Journal = {{WORLD DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{133}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Numerous empirical studies have sought to compare corruption across
   regions or countries. It is however individuals who are corrupt, not
   regions or countries. Studies of corruption should therefore investigate
   individual behavior. This has not been previously possible other than in
   survey responses on payment of bribes because of lack of data. We use
   individual-level data from the China Corruption Conviction Databank to
   investigate bribe-taking among officials in local-government
   public-administration and parallel Party bureaucracies. We find that
   bribes that officials received systematically increase with positions at
   higher levels of official hierarchies. Economic authority to decide on
   spending and regulation is associated with receiving greater bribes than
   being in administrative positions. Consistent with life-cycle
   incentives, entry-level and retirement-approaching officials take higher
   bribes than middle-aged officials. Being more educated does not deter
   corruption but on the contrary is associated with taking higher bribes.
   Gender is not correlated with the size of the bribes taken. We link our
   empirical results on bribes to the theory of rent seeking in
   bureaucratic hierarchies. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},

Month = {{AUG 17}},
Abstract = {{Background Evidence is needed regarding effective incentive strategies
   to increase clinician survey response rates. Cash cards are increasingly
   used as survey incentives; they are appealing because of their
   convenience and because in some cases their value can be reclaimed by
   investigators if not used. However, their effectiveness in clinician
   surveys is not known. In this study within the BRCA Founder OutReach
   (BFOR) study, a clinical trial of population-basedBRCA1/2mutation
   screening, we compared the use of upfront cash cards requiring email
   activation versus checks as clinician survey incentives. Methods
   Participants receiving BRCA1/2 testing in the BFOR study could elect to
   receive their results from their primary care provider (PCP, named by
   the patient) or from a geneticist associated with the study. In order to
   understand PCPs' knowledge, attitudes, experiences and willingness to
   disclose results we mailed paper surveys to the first 501 primary care
   providers (PCPs) in New York, Boston, Los Angeles and Philadelphia who
   were nominated by study participants to disclose theirBRCA1/2mutation
   results obtained through the study. We used alternating assignment
   stratified by city to assign the first 303 clinicians to receive a \$50
   up-front incentive as a cash card (N = 155) or check (N = 148). The cash
   card required PCPs to send an activation email in order to be used. We
   compared response rates by incentive type, adjusting for PCP
   characteristics and study site. Results In unadjusted analyses, PCPs who
   received checks were more likely to respond to the survey than those who
   received cash cards (54.1\% versus 41.9\%,p = 0.046); this remained true
   when we adjusted for provider characteristics (OR for checks 1.61, 95\%
   CI 1.01, 2.59). No other clinician characteristics had a statistically
   significant association with response rates in adjusted analyses. When
   we included an interaction term for incentive type and city, the
   favorable impact of checks on response rates was evident only in Los
   Angeles and Philadelphia. Conclusions An up-front cash card incentive
   requiring email activation may be less effective in eliciting clinician
   responses than up-front checks. However, the benefit of checks for
   clinician response rates may depend on clinicians' geographic location.}},

Abstract = {{To improve the economic and environmental sustainability of agriculture,
   information is needed on how to target research, teaching, and outreach

   agricultural producers specifically, is increasingly challenging given
   issues such as declining response rates and limited resources. While
   studies examining the best practices for promoting higher response rates
   exist, few focus explicitly on agricultural producers. In three separate
   surveys conducted with agricultural producers in South Dakota in 2018
   and 2019, we included experiments testing how token pre-incentives, a
   research partnership, and response mode options impacted response rates.
   We also examined how sample source and email augmentations influence
   survey responses. The study findings indicate that providing
   pre-incentives and multiple simultaneous response options can increase
   response rates with agricultural producers. On the other hand, email
   augmentation to mail surveys, sample source, and identification of
   select institutional research partnerships appear to have minimal
   effects.}},

   experiences were the most common reasons practice leaders decided to
   obtain PCMH recognition and pursue associated care delivery changes.
   Leadership support and direction were highlighted as essential
   throughout PCMH transformation. Practice leaders reported needing
   specialized staff knowledge and significant resources to meet PCMH
   requirements, including staff knowledgeable about how to implement PCMH
   changes, track and monitor improvements, and navigate implementation of
   simultaneous changes, and staff with specific quality improvement (QI)
   expertise related to evaluating changes and scaling-up programs.
   Conclusion PCMH efforts necessitated support and assistance to
   frontline, on-site practice leaders leading care delivery changes. Such
   change efforts should include financial incentives (e.g., direct payment
   or additional reimbursement), leadership direction and support, and
   internal or external staff with experience with the PCMH application
   process, implementation changes, and QI expertise in monitoring process
   and outcome data. Policies that recognize and meet the needs of on-site
   practice leaders will better promote primary care practice
   transformation and move practices further toward their PCMH
   transformation goals.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of travelers' response behavior to transportation demand
   management is receiving substantial attention among researchers and
   transport operators in recent years. While previous studies in this area
   have generally assumed that the sensitivity of travelers to different
   factors is homogeneous and relies on survey responses, which may be
   prone to self-reporting errors and/or subject to behavioral
   incongruence. Relying on naturalistic data, this paper aims to
   investigate the behavioral response to pre-peak discount pricing
   strategy in the context of the Beijing subway with a special focus on
   the heterogeneity among the travelers. Anonymous smart card data from
   5946 travelers before and after the introduction of a peak avoidance
   policy in Beijing are used to construct a latent class choice model to
   capture the sensitivity to different factors and the associated taste
   heterogeneity of travelers. Given the passive nature of the data, the
   model can offer more realistic outputs. The results indicate that there
   is substantial heterogeneity in travelers' responses to the peak
   avoidance policy, and that they can be probabilistically allocated to
   four latent classes. For all classes of travelers, the decision to shift
   their departure to off-peak is affected by the monetary saving, the
   required change in departure time and the frequency of travel, but in
   different magnitudes. In particular, only two classes of travelers (who
   exhibit lower standard-deviation in pre-intervention departure time)
   show significant sensitivity to price changes indicating that the
   discount policies are more likely to be effective for these groups. The
   rest of travelers are largely price insensitive - warranting the need
   for non-monetary incentives as opposed to fare discounts. To the best of
   our knowledge, this study is the first to innovatively apply the LCC
   framework to analyze travelers' heterogeneous behavior using large-scale
   smart card data without socio-demographic information. The findings can
   provide guidance to the subway authority in devising differential peak
   avoidance policies targeted for different groups of users, which are
   likely to be more effective than the current one size fits all'
   approach. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Exploring the potential of using nudges to promote food hygiene in the
   pork value chain in Vietnam}},
Journal = {{PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{181}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Interventions designed to reduce the burden of foodborne illness often
   require value chain actors to alter undesired and risky behaviours. This
   desired behavioural change may be supported by `nudge theory', a
   sub-field of behavioural economics, which describes how individuals can
   be encouraged, or `nudged', to act in ways which produce net societal
   benefits without restricting freedom of choice.
   This research aimed to investigate the use of nudges in the pork value
   chain in Vietnam. Key informant interviews (n = 12) were initially
   utilised to document the type of nudges being used within existing food
   safety interventions, followed by a questionnaire-based survey (n = 132)
   to describe the behavioural elements of pork value chain actors which
   could be amenable to nudging. Finally, a workshop was conducted to
   measure the response of stakeholders (n = 30) to various nudge elements
   which could be used to support future food safety interventions.
   Key informant interviews demonstrated that the use of behavioural nudges
   were a common aspect of food safety interventions in the pork value
   chain in Hanoi and Hung Yen Province. Survey participants reported that
   when considering food safety, veterinarians and actors' peers were
   highly trusted, and reputation was thought to be an effective incentive
   to illicit behavioural change. During the workshop, stakeholders
   appeared aware of the major slaughter and retail contamination points
   and cited lack of access to improved infrastructure as the limiting
   factor in their ability to improve hygiene. Value chain actors reported
   positive responses to the concept of using posters containing
   photographic images as nudges and stipulated that media should reflect
   the local context and contain language framed to suit the target
   audience.
   We suggest that the findings of this study are used to create site
   specific nudges for the Vietnamese pork industry targeting key value
   chain actors, such slaughterhouse workers and traditional retailers,
   which should be tested in the field to investigate their effectiveness.}},

   Electric Vehicles in Qatar}},
Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{15}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) have proven to be a crucial
   factor to decreasing the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) into the
   atmosphere. However, there are various hurdles that impede people from
   purchasing EVs. For example, long charging time, short driving range,
   cost and insufficient charging infrastructures available, etc. This
   article reports the public perception of EV-adoption using statistical
   analyses and proposes some recommendations for improving EV-adoption in
   Qatar. User perspectives on EV-adoption barriers in Qatar were
   investigated based on survey questionnaires. The survey questionnaires
   were based on similar studies done in other regions of the world. The
   study attempted to look at different perspectives of the adoption of EV,
   when asked to a person who is aware of EVs (technical respondents-people
   studying/working at universities/research centers and policy makers) or
   a person who may or may not be aware of EVs (non-technical
   respondents-people working in banks, governments and private
   non-academic organizations, etc.). Cumulative survey responses from the
   two groups were compared and analyzed using two-samplet-test statistical
   analysis. Detailed analyses showed that-among various major
   hindrances-raising of public awareness of such greener modes of
   transportation, the availability of charging options in more places and
   policy incentives towards EVs would play a major role in EV-adoption.
   The authors provide recommendations that-along with government
   incentives-could help make a gradual shift to a greater number of EVs
   convenient for people of Qatar. The proposed systematic approach for
   such a study and analysis may help in streamlining research on policies,
   infrastructures and technologies for efficient penetration of EVs in
   Qatar.}},

Abstract = {{The main research problem discussed in this paper involves evaluation of
   the motives of agricultural producers for pursuing and developing
   organic production. The aim of this study is to identify and evaluate
   the role of social values in stimulating decisions of involvement in
   organic production. Analytical observations were conducted on the basis
   of responses to surveys on a nation-representative sample in Poland (350
   conventional farms and 70 organic farms in 2011; 260 conventional farms
   and 65 organic farms in 2019). Analyses were conducted in relation to
   the potential and perspectives for development of organic farming. They
   were focused on identifying the original motives for such decisions
   (incentives and disincentives). This allowed for effective evaluation of
   both the trend and the pace of the studied processes. The development
   potential of organic farming in Poland was estimated at 5-15\% of the
   total number of farms. The most important factors encouraging farmers to
   take up production are associated with social values (care for the
   natural environment and family health). A significant chance for the
   development of organic production is the expected demand growth, which
   is also related to social values: the increasing environmental awareness

Title = {{European rabbit hunting: Management changes and inertia in the

Journal = {{JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{56}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The recreational use of natural resources requires the implementation of
   sustainable management systems. However, the existence of socioeconomic
   interests and the difficulty involved in applying evidence-based
   criteria often hinder this implementation. The European wild rabbit
   (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is an appropriate case with which to study the
   recreational hunting governance systems. This species has, in recent
   decades, undergone important population changes in its native area, the
   Iberian Peninsula, where it plays a triple role as a game, pest and key
   ecological species. The rabbit is consequently intensively managed for
   hunting purposes, for the conservation of rabbit-dependent predators and
   in order to mitigate damage to crops. In this paper, we study the
   governance system of rabbit hunting through the use of questionnaire
   surveys distributed to managers working for Spanish regional
   governments. We repeated the survey in 2001 and 2016 in order to
   evaluate how the system had evolved over a 15-year period of important
   changes in rabbit population abundance. We found two different responses
   to these changes. The growth of rabbit populations in provinces in which
   rabbits cause crop damage in farmland areas has been dealt with an
   increase in hunting pressure, derived from both administrative decisions
   and hunters' management. However, in provinces where rabbit populations
   have sharply declined in natural vegetation (non-farmland) areas, the
   management seems to be driven mostly by inertia, with a high influence
   of tradition and little use of evidence on administrative decisions.
   Hunters in these provinces have changed their management practices to
   little or no extent, where even the high importance of rabbit hunting
   and its (moderate) economic importance do not appear to provide an
   incentive for the change required.}},

Title = {{Sensitive Questions and Trust: Explaining Respondents' Behavior in
   Randomized Response Surveys}},
Journal = {{SAGE OPEN}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The randomized response technique (RRT) is an indirect question method
   that uses stochastic noise to increase anonymity in surveys containing
   sensitive items. Former studies often implicitly assumed that the
   respondents trust and comply with the RRT procedure and, therefore, are
   motivated to give truthful responses. However, validation studies
   demonstrated that RRT may not always be successful in eliciting truthful
   answering-even when compared with direct questioning. The article
   theoretically explores and discusses the conditions under which this
   assumption is consistent (or inconsistent) with the survey respondents'
   rational behavior. First, becauseP(A vertical bar Yes) >P(A vertical bar
   No), both types of respondents, A (with sensitive trait) and non-A
   (without sensitive trait), have an incentive to disregard the
   instructions in the RRT mode. In contrast, respondents type non-A have
   no incentive to lie in the direct questioning mode. Thus, the potential
   for social desirability bias is (theoretically) higher in the RRT mode.
   Second, a basic game theoretic approach conceptualizes the survey
   interview as a social interaction between the respondent and the
   interviewer within the context of norms and mutual expectations. It is
   argued that the respondent's choice to answer truthfully depends on (a)
   the respondents' estimated likelihood that the interviewer honors trust
   and (b) a relative comparison of the utility from conforming to ``the
   norm of truthfulness{''} versus its costs. Finally, we review previous
   empirical evidence and show that our theoretical model can explain both
   successes and failures of the RRT.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Text messaging systems are used to collect data on symptom
   prevalence. Using a text messaging system, we evaluated the effects of
   question load, question frequency, and financial incentive on response
   rates and reported infant diarrhoea rates in an infant diarrhoea survey.
   Methods: We performed a factorial cross-over randomised controlled trial
   of an SMS surveying system for infant diarrhoea surveillance with
   treatments: financial incentive (yes/no), question load
   (1-question/3-question), and questioning frequency (daily/fortnightly).
   Participants progressed through all treatment combinations over eight
   two-week rounds. Data were analysed using multivariable logistic
   regressions to determine the impacts of the treatments on the response
   rates and reported diarrhoea rates. Attitudes were explored through
   qualitative interviews.
   Results: For the 141 participants, the mean response rate was 47\%. In
   terms of percentage point differences (ppd), daily questioning was
   associated with a lower response rate than fortnightly (- 1 center dot
   2{[}95\%CI:-4 center dot 9,2 center dot 5]); high (3-question) question
   loads were associated with a lower response rate than low (1-question)
   question loads (- 7 center dot 0{[}95\%CI:- 10 center dot 8,-3 center
   dot 1]); and financial incentivisation was associated with a higher
   response rate than no financial incentivisation (6 center dot
   4{[}95\%CI:2 center dot 6,10 center dot 2]).
   The mean two-week diarrhoea rate was 36 center dot 4\%. Daily
   questioning was associated with a higher reported diarrhoea rate than
   fortnightly (29 center dot 9{[}95\%CI:22 center dot 8,36 center dot 9]);
   with little evidence for impact by incentivisation or question load.
   Conclusions: Close to half of all participants responded to the SMS
   survey. Daily questioning evoked a statistically higher rate of reported
   diarrhoea, while financial incentivisation and low (1-question) question
   loads evoked higher response rates than no incentive and high
   (3-question) question loads respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation science needs more high-quality impact evaluations,
   especially ones that explore mechanisms of success or failure.
   Randomized control trials (RCTs) provide particularly robust evidence of
   the effectiveness of interventions (although they have been criticized
   as reductionist and unable to provide insights into mechanisms), but
   there have been few such experiments investigating conservation at the
   landscape scale. We explored the impact of Watershared, an
   incentive-based conservation program in the Bolivian Andes, with one of
   the few RCTs of landscape-scale conservation in existence. There is
   strong interest in such incentive-based conservation approaches as some
   argue they can avoid negative social impacts sometimes associated with
   protected areas. We focused on social and environmental outcomes based
   on responses from a household survey in 129 communities randomly
   allocated to control or treatment (conducted both at the baseline in
   2010 and repeated in 2015-2016). We controlled for incomplete program
   uptake by combining standard RCT analysis with matching methods and
   investigated mechanisms by exploring intermediate and ultimate outcomes
   according to the underlying theory of change. Previous analyses, focused
   on single biophysical outcomes, showed that over its first 5 years
   Watershared did not slow deforestation or improve water quality at the
   landscape scale. We found that Watershared influenced some outcomes
   measured using the survey, but the effects were complex, and some were
   unexpected. We thus demonstrated how RCTs can provide insights into the
   pathways of impact, as well as whether an intervention has impact. This
   paper, one of the first registered reports in conservation science,
   demonstrates how preregistration can help make complex research designs
   more transparent, avoid cherry picking, and reduce publication bias.}},

Abstract = {{Background Burnout is a substantial phenomenon across healthcare
   settings, affecting more than half of healthcare professionals and
   leading to negative patient and health system outcomes. Infusion center
   professionals (ICPs) are at increased risk of burnout attributed to high
   patient volume and acuity levels. Strategies to address burnout have
   been developed and prioritized by the American Medical Association
   (AMA), the World Health Organization, and other organizations. Aims This
   quality improvement project aimed to address perceived burnout,
   job-related stress, and job satisfaction among nurses, physician
   assistants, and medical assistants at a large pediatric hospital through
   integration of two infusion center (IC)-based staff engagement
   interventions. Methods A pre- and post-test study design was used.
   Existing team huddles in the IC were modified based on the AMA STEPS
   Forward program recommendations to incorporate appreciative inquiry and
   recognition into team and department events. Peer recognition was
   tailored toward institutional core values. The Mini-Z Burnout survey was
   administered before and 3 months after implementation of both
   interventions. Findings Pre- to post-intervention responses revealed a
   higher percentage of staff reporting no burnout (57.7\% vs. 75\%), low
   levels of job-related stress (58.8\% vs. 65.5\%), and satisfaction with
   current job (70.6\% vs. 82.8\%). Most participants agreed or strongly
   agreed that structured huddles (69\%) and recognition events (82.8\%)
   were beneficial and recommended continuation (65.5\% and 82.8\%,
   respectively). Open-ended responses regarding workplace stressors
   focused heavily on staffing and patient acuity. Linking Evidence to
   Action Project outcomes support the integration of tailored
   interventions to reduce burnout among pediatric ICPs. Organizational
   commitment to addressing burnout can provide incentive to scale up
   institution-wide staff engagement interventions. Further study is needed
   to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of such tailored
   interventions across diverse settings.}},

Abstract = {{Overharvesting of terrestrial and marine resources may be alleviated by
   encouraging an alternative configuration of livelihoods, particularly in
   rural communities in developing countries. Typical occupations in such
   areas include fishing and farming, and rural households often switch
   livelihood activities to suit climate and economic conditions. We used a
   machine-learning tool, deep-belief networks (DBN), and data from surveys
   of a rural Philippine coastal community to examine household desire to
   change livelihood. This desire is affected by a variety of factors, such
   as income, family needs, and feelings of work satisfaction, that are
   interrelated in complex ways. In farming households, livelihood changes
   often occur to diversify resources, increase income, and lessen economic
   risk. The DBN, given its multilayer perceptron structure, has a capacity
   to model nonlinear relationships among factors while providing an
   acceptable degree of accuracy. Relative to a set of 34 features (e.g.,
   education, boat ownership, and work satisfaction), we examined the
   binary response variables desire to change work or not to change work.
   The best network had a test set accuracy of 97.5\%. Among the features,
   7 significantly affected desire to shift work: ethnicity, work
   satisfaction, number of persons in a household in ill health, number of
   fighting cocks owned, fishing engagement, buy-and-sell revenue, and
   educational level. A cross-correlation matrix of these 7 features
   indicated households less inclined to change work were those engaged in
   fishing and retail buying and selling. For fishing, provision of
   economic and other incentives should be considered to encourage changing
   from this occupation to allow recovery of fishery resources.}},

Abstract = {{Do partisan disagreements over politically relevant facts, and
   preferences for the information sources from which to obtain them,
   represent genuine differences of opinion or insincere cheerleading? The
   answer to this question is crucial for understanding the scope of
   partisan polarization. We test between these alternatives with
   experiments that offer incentives for correct survey responses and allow
   respondents to search for information before answering each question. We
   find that partisan cheerleading inflates divides in factual information,
   but only modestly. Incentives have no impact on partisan divides in
   information search; these divides are no different from those that occur
   outside the survey context when we examine web-browsing data from the
   same respondents. Overall, our findings support the motivated reasoning
   interpretation of misinformation; partisans seek out information with
   congenial slant and sincerely adopt inaccurate beliefs that cast their
   party in a favorable light.}},

Abstract = {{Objective This study aimed to survey health care professionals in Sweden
   on the factors that they believe have been most important in reaching
   the current level of patient safety and achieving safer care in the
   future as well as the characteristics of the county councils that have
   been the most successful in achieving safe care. Methods The study
   population consisted of 222 patient safety officers, that is, health
   care professionals with strategic positions in patient safety work in
   the county councils. A postal questionnaire was used for data
   collection. Results The survey response rate was 70\%. The factors that
   were considered most important for the current level of patient safety
   were efforts to reduce the use of antibiotics; Swedish patient safety
   law; and internal discussions with the county council management, heads
   of health care units, health care providers, and so on. The factors that
   were considered most important to achieve safer care in the future were
   improved communication between health care practitioners and patients,
   improved organizational culture, improved communication, and patient
   safety knowledge as a compulsory component of basic education for health
   care practitioners. Conclusions Several factors rated highly for
   achieving the current level of patient safety are part of the
   government-supported financial incentive plan. Patient safety is
   attributed to a broad range of factors, and many solutions might
   contribute to improved patient safety in the future. The most successful
   county councils are characterized by leadership support for patient
   safety, well-organized patient safety work, long-term commitment to
   patient safety, and an organizational culture that is conducive to
   patient safety.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{30}},

Pages = {{567-573}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background: The European Health Interview Survey (EHIS) provides
   cross-national data on health status, health care and health
   determinants. So far, 10 of the 30 member states (MS) opted for
   web-based questionnaires within mixed-mode designs but none used it as
   the sole mode. In the context of future EHIS, the response rate and net
   sample composition of a web-only approach was tested. Methods: A Belgian
   study with a target sample size of 1000 (age: 16-85) was organized using
   the EHIS wave 3 model questionnaire. The sample was selected according
   to a multistage, clustered sampling procedure with geographical
   stratification. Field substitution was applied; non-participating
   households were replaced by similar households regarding statistical
   sector, sex and age. There was one reminder letter and a (sic)10
   conditional incentive. Results: Considering all substitutions, a 16\%
   response rate was obtained after sending one reminder. Elderly, Brussels
   Capital inhabitants, people living without a partner and those with a
   non-Belgian nationality were less responding. By design, there were no
   differences between the initial and final net sample regarding
   substitution characteristics. Nevertheless, people living without a
   partner, non-Belgians and lower educated people remain underrepresented.
   Conclusion: There was a low response rate, particularly for some
   population groups. The response rate was lower than those of MS using
   mixedmode designs including web, especially these comprising
   interviewer-based approaches. Despite the long and complex
   questionnaire, there was a low break off rate. So far, web-only data
   collection is not an acceptable strategy for population-based health
   surveys but efforts to increase the response should be further explored.}},

   Australian Stakeholders' Perceptions}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{With increased construction activities in capital cities of Australia,
   the sustainable management of construction and demolition (C\&D) has
   become an important item in the federal and state government agendas.
   According to the universally accepted concept of waste hierarchy waste
   disposal is the worst preferred waste management option due to
   environmental issues. Currently, in most Australian jurisdictions, a
   landfill levy is applied to discourage waste disposal and to further
   encourage waste recovery. However, there is an ongoing debate as to
   whether the levy regime could achieve the desired outcome. Therefore,
   this study, funded by the Australian Sustainable Built Environment
   National Research Centre, explored the effectiveness of the current
   landfill levy across Australian jurisdictions. The paper presents the
   findings of this study that were obtained from a questionnaire survey
   aiming to capture the main C\&D waste management stakeholders on
   landfill taxing imposition in Australia. The study collected 132
   responses from professionals in the construction industry and other
   industries dealing with C\&D waste management and resource recovery. The
   results demonstrated that those who believed in market incentive
   approaches outweigh people that were in favour of pecuniary impost
   approach. Among those who favoured pecuniary imposts, almost 90\% of
   participants agreed with the effectiveness of landfill levies in any
   waste management system. Other results provided a useful insight into
   the actual implications of the current levy scheme. It is expected that
   the findings in this study contribute to developing sound policies that
   provide a level field for all key stakeholders and to ensure that
   resource recovery is further encouraged.}},

Abstract = {{The IT-enabled sharing economy has enabled the taxi to become an
   Internet product, forming a popular new phenomenon in people's daily
   lives and creating new roles for employees. How the Internet taxi
   drivers' work engagement is influenced in the context of the IT-enabled
   sharing economy has become an interesting new area for IS researchers to
   explore. Although monetary rewards are important for employees' behavior
   and performance, extant studies primarily emphasize the crowding-out and
   crowding-in effects of financial incentives, rather than the influencing
   mechanism. This article prospects and develops theoretically the effects
   of monetary rewards and workplace spirituality on work engagement and
   demonstrates these effects empirically. An analysis of 35 semistructured
   interviews revealed three intrinsic motivators: stress reduction, job
   autonomy, and self-efficacy. We propose a structural model based upon
   motivation crowding theory. Responses to 235 survey responses showed
   that work engagement can be improved by providing monetary rewards and
   enhancing workplace spirituality through intrinsic motivators. This
   research contributes to exploring the mediating role of intrinsic
   motivators, extends motivation crowding theory to a new research field,
   and provides a new perspective on work engagement in the context of the
   IT-enabled sharing economy. Our findings extend the previous research
   associated with workplace spirituality and the existing knowledge of
   operations management from the perspective of labor intensity and

Abstract = {{Incentive-based demand response (DR) policy plays an important role in
   guiding residents' electricity consumption behavior. How to effectively
   implement the DR policy has become a scientific issue that needs to be
   addressed urgently. To this end, based on the data from large-scale DR
   trials and matching questionnaires, the policy implementation path has
   been analyzed. The results show that households responded to the DR
   policy saved 0.09 kW h more electricity in the 1.5-h response period
   than households that did not respond to the DR policy. On the management
   implementation side, the subsidy price is crucial. Community publicity
   can also enhance the electricity saving effect. It also has been found
   that the electricity-saving potential of the low-level community is
   relatively limited. On the households' response side, households with
   higher household incomes, younger income earners, more air conditioners
   and small appliances, and higher gas consumption have higher policy
   participation. The novelty and originality of this article is that the
   data collected through large-scale controlled trials are unique and
   valuable. And we creatively combined trial data and surveys data
   together, which will enable us to further explore the

Journal = {{THERAPEUTIC INNOVATION \& REGULATORY SCIENCE}},
Abstract = {{Background Pharmaceutical companies and regulatory agencies endeavor to
   relate their decision making with outcomes to improve future decision
   making and to ensure that gained knowledge is fed back into a learning
   system. Nevertheless, such a correlation can only be achieved by
   documenting the expected outcome of a decision at the time it is made,
   enabling comparison of the expected outcome with the actual result.
   Methods Participants at an international workshop discussed how the
   documentation of decisions could be evolved as companies and agencies
   look to improve their knowledge base. Discussions were informed by a
   pre-workshop survey of pharmaceutical companies and regulatory agencies.
   Results Most survey participants from 12 companies (55\% response rate)
   and 11 agencies (73\% response) have a system in place to enable
   documentation of major decisions, however, systems are used primarily to
   document outcomes rather than the process, while information from
   documentation is not always used, and feedback loops are not in place.
   The majority of participants indicated that their organization currently
   documents most decision-making practices included in the proposed
   template. Workshop participants agreed that all major past decisions
   should be referenceable and suggested incentives to enable decisions to
   be referenced, and confirmed elements and characteristics of a

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 12}},
Abstract = {{Aim
   In surveys non-responders may introduce bias and lower the validity of
   the studies. Ways to increase response rates are therefore important.
   The purpose of the study was to investigate if an unconditional monetary
   incentive can increase the response rate for vulnerable children and
   youths in a postal questionnaire survey.
   Methods
   The study was designed as a randomized controlled trial. The study
   population consisted of 262 children and youth who participated in an
   established intervention study aimed at creating networks for different
   groups of vulnerable children and youths. The mean age of the
   participants was 16.7 years (range 11-28) and 67.9\% were female. The
   questionnaire was adapted to three different age groups and covered
   different aspects of the participants' life situation, including the
   dimensions from the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). In
   the follow-up survey, participants were randomly allocated to two groups
   that either received a (sic)15 voucher for a supermarket together with
   the questionnaire or only received the questionnaire. We used Poisson
   regression to estimate the differences in response rate (Rate Ratio RR)
   between the intervention group and the control group.
   Results
   The response rate was 75.5\% in the intervention group and 42.9\% in the
   control group. The response rate in the intervention group was
   significantly higher than in the control group when adjusting for age
   and gender (Rate Ratio, RR 1.73; 95\% CI 1.38-2.17). We did not find any
   significant differences in scales scores between the two groups for the
   five scales of the SDQ. In stratified analyses, we found the effect of
   the incentive to be higher for males (RR 2.81; 95\% CI 1.61-4.91) than
   for females (1.43; 95\% CI 1.12-1.84).
   Conclusions
   Monetary incentives can increase the response rate for vulnerable
   children and youths in surveys.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES The Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services (CMS) Nursing
   Home Quality Initiative aims to improve quality through performance
   measurement. We describe quality improvement (QI) changes that skilled
   nursing facilities (SNFs) reported making in response to CMS performance
   measurements and whether reported QI changes were associated with better
   performance on CMS performance measures.
   DESIGN Nationally representative survey.
   SETTING A total of 15,475 SNFs that reported quality performance on
   Nursing Home Compare in 2016.
   PARTICIPANTS A total of 1,182 SNFs (58\% of random sample of 2,045
   SNFs).
   MEASUREMENTS Adoption of 22 possible QI changes, grouped into seven
   categories (organizational culture, health information technology, care
   process redesign, provider incentives, changes to staffing
   responsibilities, performance monitoring, and measure-specific QI
   initiatives and technical assistance); performance on the CMS Nursing
   Home Compare Five-Star Quality Rating System's quality measure rating.
   RESULTS SNFs reported making an average of 13 QI changes (interquartile
   range = 11-16 changes). SNFs mostly commonly reported becoming a
   learning organization (87\%) and providing training to staff on QI
   strategies (87\%). After controlling for patient and facility
   characteristics, larger SNFs were more likely to obtain assistance on
   measure reporting from QI organizations and use provider champions than
   smaller SNFs by 14 and 11 percentage points, respectively. Rural SNFs
   and SNFs with higher proportions of disabled, black, or Hispanic
   residents adopted QI changes at similar rates as other SNFs. Of the 22
   QI changes, 20 were considered at least somewhat helpful by more than
   80\% of adopting SNFs. Implementation of all 22 QI changes (vs no
   changes) was associated with a .48-star higher quality measure rating
   (95\% confidence interval = .003-.98 stars; P = .05).
   CONCLUSION In response to CMS measurement programs, SNFs reported making
   substantial QI investments that were associated with better performance
   on CMS quality measures. To guide future SNF investments in QI, work is
   needed to identify the QI changes that yield the greatest performance
   improvements.}},

   auditor choice}},
Journal = {{ACCOUNTING ORGANIZATIONS AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{83}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{A firm's decision on whether to choose the same auditor as a close
   competitor reflects a trade-off between exercising caution to protect
   its proprietary information and pursuing the benefits of auditor
   knowledge derived from providing services to comparable clients. We
   conduct a survey of audit partners whose responses confirm that clients
   weigh these competing incentives when selecting an external auditor.
   Building on our survey evidence from very experienced practitioners, we
   empirically analyze this phenomenon using archival data. Employing a
   pairwise similarity measure based on descriptions from regulatory
   filings, we find that, on average, peer firms are more likely to engage
   the same auditor when their product offerings are more similar. In
   instances when the focal firm shares the same auditor with more similar
   peer firms, the focal firm benefits from enhanced audit quality while
   also paying lower audit fees. Despite these benefits, we find that peer
   firms are less likely to share auditors with rivals in settings with
   greater perceived costs of information leakage as well as embedded
   auditor-client relationships in which the auditor retains deep client
   knowledge. Collectively, we provide evidence that, although the upside
   stemming from auditor knowledge, on average, dominates the downside of
   greater vulnerability to information leakage, proprietary cost concerns
   motivate firms to deviate from seeking auditor expertise. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{Purpose Given the increasing importance of political decision-making to
   reduce emission targets, the main purpose of the current paper is to
   identify and test the considerations that would nudge consumers towards
   an environmentally and health-friendly motor vehicle. Methods An online
   survey was conducted to assess public responses and the role of public
   authorities to a voluntary emission standard for passenger cars. In
   addition, two online experiments were conducted to test incentives in
   the design of ecolabels (e.g. price, safety, performance) for
   optimization. A random sample of 6400 individuals was drawn from eight
   countries: Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, UK, Czech
   Republic and Lithuania. An online survey was conducted among 3200
   respondents, 400 in each of the 8 countries, and 2 online experiments
   with 3200 subjects, 400 in each of the 8 countries, allowing for 200
   respondents for each experiment in each country. Results and discussion
   The survey shows that Europeans are aware of the health and
   environmental impact of cars. The findings also confirm the gap between
   self-reported attitudes/intentions and actual behaviours. In influencing
   car purchase decisions, health and environmental concerns are less
   important than other attributes such as price, safety and performance.
   The experiments show that all these attributes have a significant effect
   on consumers' choices. However, message content was found to have the
   strongest effect. Respondents are more likely to choose European Union
   Low Emitting carS (EULES)-friendly cars when the label shows information
   on lower costs or lower taxes and less likely to be influenced by
   health-related benefits, convenient parking or access fees. Finally,
   combinations of one message with other elements-EULES logo, CO2 logo or
   both-within the same label have a small but positive effect on
   respondents' choices. Conclusions The findings of this study assist
   governmental decision-making processes by identifying those issues that
   have the greatest impact on consumers' car purchasing decisions.
   Furthermore, the results will help to guide environmentally conscious
   customers towards the purchase of vehicles with clean emission profiles.}},

Title = {{Making energy surveys more impactful: Testing material and non-monetary
   response strategies}},
Journal = {{ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{63}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Recent years have seen a growth in energy research that integrates
   social and behavioural sciences. A core component of this work involves
   collecting human data, commonly via surveys and field experiments. But
   there are often barriers to recruiting large and representative samples
   of participants, with sampling bias and non-response error posing
   threats to validity. Identifying cost-effective ways to increase
   participation in energy research is therefore important for
   strengthening the rigor, utility and generalisability of studies in this
   area. To this end, the current study harnesses an experimental design to
   test pathways for making energy surveys more impactful - specifically by
   improving response rates and times, lowering sampling bias, and
   enhancing overall cost-effectiveness. As part of a postal survey on
   household energy use in Australia, a set of randomised controlled trials
   were conducted to test the impact of four strategies: incentives, an
   envelope message, a handwritten sticky note, and a reminder postcard. A
   3 x 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design was applied to assess both individual and
   interactive effects. While material incentives in the form of an upfront
   token gift and prize draw were ineffective in improving response
   relative to the control survey, results revealed that a handwritten
   sticky note expressing upfront thanks for participating - designed to
   serve as an intrinsically motivating attentional cue - improved both the
   rate and timeliness of response. Three combinations of strategies
   yielded significantly higher response rates than the control, but they
   were more expensive on a `dollar cost per response' basis. Implications
   for research and practice are discussed.}},

   facilitators to a daily mobile phone sexual risk assessment for young
   women in Soweto, South Africa}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Background
   The HIV epidemiology in South Africa reveals stark age and gender
   disparities, with young women being the most vulnerable to HIV
   acquisition in 2017. Evaluation of HIV exposure is a challenge in HIV
   prevention research. Intermittent in-clinic interviewer-administered
   risk behaviour assessments are utilised but may be limited by social
   desirability and recall biases. We piloted a mobile phone application
   for daily self-report of sexual risk behaviour in fifty 18-25 year old
   women at risk of HIV infection enrolled in HIV Vaccine Trials Network
   915 (HVTN 915) in Soweto, South Africa. Through a mixed-methods
   investigation, we explored barriers and facilitators to completing daily
   mobile phone surveys among HVTN 915 study participants and staff.
   Methods
   We analysed quantitative data on barriers and facilitators to mobile
   phone study completion collected during the larger HVTN 915 study as
   well as two post-study focus group discussions (FGDs) with fifteen
   former participants with a median age of 24 years (IQR 23-25) and six
   individual in-depth interviews (IDIs) with HVTN 915 staff. FGDs and IDIs
   utilised semi-structured interview guides, were audio-recorded,
   transcribed verbatim and translated to English. After coding, thematic
   analysis was performed.
   Results
   The main facilitator for daily mobile phone survey completion assessed
   across 336 follow-up visits for 49 participants was the daily short
   message system (SMS) reminders (93\%, 312/336). Across 336 visits, 31/49
   (63\%) retained participants reported barriers to completion of daily
   mobile phone surveys: forgetting (20\%, 12/49), being too busy (19\%,
   11/49) and the survey being an inconvenience (15\%, 9/49). Five main
   themes were identified during the coding of IDIs and FGDs: (1)
   facilitators of mobile phone survey completion, such as daily SMS
   reminders and follow up calls for non-completers; (2) barriers to mobile
   phone survey completion, including partner, time-related and technical
   barriers; (3) power of incentives; (4) response bias in providing
   sensitive information, and (5) recommendations for future mobile phone
   based interventions.
   Conclusion
   Despite our enthusiasm to use innovation to optimise sexual risk
   assessments, technical and practical solutions are required to improve
   implementation. We recommend further engagement with participants to
   optimise this approach and to further understand social desirability
   bias and study incentives in sexual risk reporting.}},

Abstract = {{In order for humans to achieve a healthier diet and maintain ecological
   balance, a new concept regarding sustainable food has been introduced.
   The aim of this study is, therefore, to explore consumers' interest in
   choosing sustainable food. The study utilized ``Do Survey,{''} an
   internet survey platform, to distribute questionnaires. Survey
   invitations were sent out in a snowball manner. Invitations were posted
   in multiple online communities and forwarded by various members to other
   sites; 333 valid responses were collected. The results show that family
   and friend support and health incentive are the two strongest predictors
   for sustainable food buying interest. Price accessibility, on the other
   hand, has no impact on interest. This is not to say that price
   accessibility does not influence behavior. It just means that it is not
   the factor that fosters interest. Once an individual is interested,
   she/he may still rely heavily on price accessibility in purchasing
   sustainable food.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PEST SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{929-939}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Area wide management (AWM) is a coordinated strategy designed to achieve
   effective and longer-lasting suppression of mobile insect pests,
   involving groups of commercial growers working together and/or with
   local communities to achieve control across multiple host areas. In this
   study, we hypothesised that intentions to carry out AWM for the control
   of fruit fly would be predicted by subjective knowledge of insect pests,
   along with protection motivation factors (perceived pest threat
   severity, threat vulnerability, self-efficacy, AWM response efficacy and
   response costs). Fruit and vegetable growers (n = 131) and general
   public (n = 896) living in fruit-growing regions completed a large-scale
   telephone survey, measuring perceptions and intentions to implement area
   wide management. Regression analyses tested the relationship between
   intention, protection motivation factors and subjective knowledge, F(8,
   1018) = 48.52, p < .001, yielding a statistically significant predictive
   model accounting for approximately 30\% of behavioural variance in
   intention. Self-efficacy, threat severity, response efficacy and threat
   vulnerability were the most influential predictors of intention.
   Subjective knowledge was not a strong predictor, but results did clarify
   that explicit knowledge of fruit fly controls, rather than tacit
   knowledge of fruit fly itself, was a significant predictor of intention.
   Understanding motivational drivers for farmer and community engagement
   in pest management can not only help predict uptake of novel practices,
   but also allude to how individual farmers and communities are
   articulating a pest problem. The importance of explanatory factors such
   as threat appraisal and self-efficacy in framing management activities
   can help to better target behavioural incentives.}},

Title = {{Social Norms Moderate the Effect of Tax System on Tax Evasion: Evidence
   from a Large-Scale Survey Experiment}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we reconcile conflicting findings from the extant
   literature on the impact of tax system parameters on tax noncompliance.
   We argue that social norms play a role of heuristics facilitating tax
   payers' response to the instrumental incentives posed by the systemic
   parameters, such as tax rate and penalties for evasion, and thus
   moderate the effect of those parameters on willingness to evade taxes.
   Relying on a unique survey experiment conducted in fourteen countries of
   Central-Eastern Europe, we demonstrate two types of a conditioning
   effect of norms. First, the impact of tax rates on respondents'
   propensity for tax evasion is moderated by the perceived norms of the
   society at large (descriptive norms). In particular, an increasing tax
   rate lowers the probability of evasion as long as one views ``most
   others{''} as honest taxpayers, which highlights the importance of
   equitability (fairness) concerns for tax compliance decisions. In
   contrast, the impact of punishment is moderated by the perceived norms
   of one's immediate reference group (subjective norms). Strong subjective
   compliance norms tend to effectively replace penalties as a mechanism
   discouraging tax evasion, suggesting that the deterrent effect of a
   penalty can be entirely suppressed when subjective norms are strong.
   These findings have important implications for the understanding of tax
   compliance decisions under different formal and informal regimes.}},

Title = {{What's the Benefit of a Video? The Effect of Nonmaterial Incentives on
   Response Rate and Bias in Web Surveys}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL SCIENCE COMPUTER REVIEW}},
Abstract = {{Traditional survey research faces declining response rates due to
   changing cultural habits and technological developments. Researchers
   have developed novel approaches to increase respondents' likelihood of
   participating in web surveys. However, we lack information about whether
   these methods indeed increase response rates and, if so, whether they
   bias the resulting data. This article focuses on the use of nonmaterial
   incentives in the form of a video that provides the invitees with
   information tailored to their life situation. Analysis of our
   experimental data shows that instead of increasing respondents'
   probability of starting the survey, the video treatments actually
   decrease it. We provide evidence that the lower salience of the
   intrinsic benefits of survey participation in the invitation email
   significantly contributes to this reduction. Additionally, the effect of
   the nonmaterial incentive differs across subgroups, affecting
   nonresponse biases in line with employment status, gender, and migration
   background. We therefore conclude that using additional information in
   the form of a video as a nonmaterial survey incentive is only suitable
   under specific conditions.}},

Title = {{Physicians' perceptions of autonomy support during transition to
   value-based reimbursement: A multi-center psychometric evaluation of
   six-item and three-item measures}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Successive health system reforms have steadily eroded physician
   autonomy. Escalating accountability demands placed on physicians
   concurrent with diminishing autonomy plus widespread ``cost cutting{''}
   endanger clinical work-life quality and, in turn, threaten patient-care
   quality, safety, and continuity. This has engendered a renewed emphasis
   on bettering physician work-life to safeguard patient care. Research
   indicates that autonomy support could be an effective intervention point
   in this dynamic, and that improving healthcare practitioners' experience
   of autonomy can promote better patient outcomes. New measures of
   autonomy support towards physicians during systemic/organizational
   transformation are thus needed.
   Objective
   We investigated the validity and reliability of two versions of a brief
   measure of physicians' perceptions of autonomy support.
   Design
   Psychometric evaluation of practitioners' responses to a theory-based,
   pilot-tested, multi-center, cross-sectional survey-questionnaire.
   Participants
   Physicians serving in California, Massachusetts, or upstate New York
   clinical practices implementing pay-for-performance incentives were
   eligible. We obtained responses from 1,534 (35.14\%) of 4,365 physicians
   surveyed.
   Analysis
   We randomly partitioned the study sample equitably into derivation and
   validation subsamples. We conducted parallel analysis,
   inter-item/point-biserial correlations, and item-response-theory-based
   graded response modeling on six autonomy support items. Three items with
   the highest (a) point-biserial correlations, (b) item-level
   discrimination and (c) information capture were used to construct a
   short-form (3-item) version of the full (6-item) autonomy scale. We
   utilized exploratory structural equation modeling and confirmatory
   factor analysis to establish the factor structure and construct validity
   of the full-length and short-form scales before comparing their factor
   invariance, reliability and interrater agreement across physician
   subgroups.
   Findings
   All six autonomy support items loaded highly onto one factor accounting
   for the majority of variance and demonstrating good data fit. The three
   most discriminating and informative items loaded equally well onto a
   single factor with similar goodness-of-fit to the data. The three-item
   scale correlated highly with its six-item parent, showing equally high
   sensitivity and specificity in discriminating high autonomy support.
   Variability in scores nested predominantly at within- rather than
   between-subgroup levels.
   Conclusions and implications
   Our data supported the factor structure, construct validity, internal
   consistency, and reliability of six- and three-item autonomy support
   scales. These brief tools are easily incorporated into multi-dimensional
   questionnaires at relatively low cost.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   This research examined how Australian construction projects perform in
   the area of client-led innovation. The purpose of this paper is to test
   the influence of a set of enablers in promoting the innovative
   performance of construction projects and examine how Australian
   construction projects perform in relation to innovation.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A questionnaire was developed and distributed to over 300 construction
   industry practitioners to obtain perceptions of industry practitioners
   regarding client-led enablers to promoting innovation at the project
   level, with 131 valid responses received. The data from the survey were
   subjected to statistical analyses including mean comparisons, using the
   Mann-Whitney U-test and Kruskal Wallis Test.
   Findings
   This research identified a number of enablers that clients can employ in
   construction projects to enhance innovative performance. It also
   revealed that the innovative performance of construction projects in
   Australia appears to be above average, although the perceived level is
   not too high. The main finding of the research is that Australian
   clients could achieve higher outcomes from construction projects by
   promoting innovativeness in their projects, especially by promoting
   innovativeness in their own organizations and providing
   incentives/rewards and other support for innovative activities in
   projects.
   Originality/value
   Past research focusing on client-led enablers at the project level is
   limited. This research identified a number of enablers that clients can
   employ to achieve greater benefits from their projects through
   innovation.}},

Title = {{What made Lebanese emigrant nurses leave and what would bring them back?
   A cross-sectional survey}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{103}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background: The nursing workforce is critical for the provision of
   quality health-care and positive patient outcomes. There is a global
   trend of migration of nurses from under-developed to developed countries
   due to attractive job offers in the host countries. Lebanon presents
   such a case where nurses are migrating abroad, leading to shortages in
   the nursing workforce in their home country.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate reasons for the
   migration of Lebanese nurses, and incentives that would attract them
   back to their home country in order to enhance the nursing workforce in
   Lebanon.
   Design: This study is a cross-sectional survey of emigrant Lebanese
   nurses.
   Settings: Recipient countries where Lebanese nurses emigrated.
   Participants: 440 Emigrant Lebanese nurses were identified through the
   registration database of the Order of Nurses in Lebanon. The survey was
   sent to all of them via email; 153 responses were received.
   Methods: Data were collected from November 2017 to March 2018. Analysis
   included univariate and bivariate tests to present descriptive
   statistics of the respondents, and to examine region of residence and
   gender in relation to their current job satisfaction, reasons for
   leaving Lebanon, intention to return to Lebanon, and aspects that would
   attract them back to their home country. Logistic regression analysis
   was used to determine the socio-demographic and work-related
   characteristics associated with the odds of returning to practice
   nursing in Lebanon.
   Results: A total 136 completed responses were considered. Emigrant
   Lebanese nurses were highly educated, with more years of work
   experience, and older than nurses remaining in their home country. Top
   reasons for nurses to leave Lebanon included unsatisfactory salary or
   benefits, better work opportunities in other countries, and lack of
   professional development or career advancement. The majority of surveyed
   nurses (59\%) expressed willingness to return to practice nursing in
   Lebanon. Aspects that would attract emigrant Lebanese nurses back to
   their home country include attractive salary or better benefits and
   opportunities for professional development, career advancement, or
   continuing education. Emigrant Lebanese nurses residing in the Gulf,
   staff nurses, and nurses with more years of work experience were more
   likely to return to practice nursing in Lebanon.
   Conclusion: Highly educated and experienced nurses are departing from
   Lebanon. This presents a challenge for the less experienced nurses
   remaining in the country, who could benefit from the mentorship and
   experience of their migrating peers. Creating an environment that could

Title = {{Factors Affecting Response Rates in Medical Imaging Survey Studies}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC RADIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{421-427}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Rationale and Objective: To review response rates published in medical
   imaging journals, and to analyze potential factors which contributed to
   a low response rate.
   Materials and Methods: A literature search was performed in MEDLINE and
   Embase to identify and assess published medical imaging survey studies.
   Variables assessed were response rate, incentives such as reminders and
   remuneration, and rationales provided for a potential low response rate.
   Statistical significance was calculated using unpaired t tests, ANOVA,
   Mann-Whitney, and Kruskal-Wallis tests.
   Results: Three hundred and fifty-six unique surveys were included for
   analysis. The mean survey response rate in the current age of
   predominately electronic surveys was 45\%. Factors which statistically
   significantly demonstrated a difference in response rate were survey
   location (European countries: 52\%, Canada: 47\%, United States: 42\%; p
   < 0.05), survey topic (musculoskeletal: 69\%, nuclear medicine: 64\%,
   and education: 47\%; p < 0.05), survey delivery method (telephone: 76\%,
   email: 41\%; p < 0.0001), and survey question type (short answer: 62\%,
   multiple choice: 43\%; p < 0.01). Statistically significant linear
   correlations were observed between the response rate compared to the
   number of reminders sent (r = 0.27; p < 0.01) and the number of
   participants (r = -0.26; p < 0.0001).
   Conclusion: The survey response rate serves as a surrogate marker for
   non-response bias. Survey response controlled for intrinsic
   nonadjustable characteristics offer achievable research goals.
   Adjustable factors to low response, including survey delivery method,
   question type, and number of reminders demonstrated statistical
   difference in response rate, and can be utilized by researchers to
   prospectively minimize nonresponse bias.}},

Abstract = {{To improve access to maternal health services, Benin introduced in 2009
   a user fee exemption policy for caesarean sections. Similar to other
   low- and middle-income countries, its implementation showed mixed
   results. Our study aimed at understanding why and in which circumstances
   the implementation of this policy in hospitals succeeded or failed. We
   adopted the realist evaluation approach and tested the initial programme
   theory through a multiple embedded case study design. We selected two
   hospitals with contrastive outcomes. We used data from 52
   semi-structured interviews, a patient exit survey, a costing study of
   caesarean section and an analysis of financial flows. In the analysis,
   we used the intervention-context-actor-mechanism-outcome configuration
   heuristic. We identified two main causal pathways. First, in the
   state-owned hospital, which has a public-oriented but administrative
   management system, and where citizens demand accountability through
   various channels, the implementation process was effective. In the
   non-state-owned hospital, managers were guided by organizational
   financial interests more than by the inherent social value of the
   policy, there was a perceived lack of enforcement and the implementation
   was poor. We found that trust, perceived coercion, adherence to policy
   goals, perceived financial incentives and fairness in their allocation
   drive compliance, persuasion, positive responses to incentives and
   self-efficacy at the operational level to generate the policy
   implementation outcomes. Compliance with the policy depended on
   enforcement by hierarchical authority and bottom-up pressure. Persuasion
   depended on the alignment of the policy with personal and organizational
   values. Incentives may determine the adoption if they influence the
   local stakeholder's revenue are trustworthy and perceived as fairly
   allocated. Failure to anticipate the differential responses of
   implementers will prevent the proper implementation of user fee
   exemption policies and similar universal health coverage reforms.}},

   Embolism: A Nationwide Survey of the Veterans Administration Healthcare

Abstract = {{Purpose: The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a challenge.
   CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) for suspected PE has become the primary
   imaging modality, but concerns regarding overutilization, overdiagnosis,
   radiation, and costs have led to algorithms that combine a clinical
   decision rule (CDR) and highly sensitive D-dimer to identify patients in
   whom PE can be safely excluded without further studies. This has been
   identified as a top five Choosing Wisely recommendation in pulmonary
   medicine, but adherence is modest at best and actual utilization is
   unknown. Therefore, a survey was conducted to determine the prevalence
   of this approach in the Veterans Administration (VA) healthcare system.
   Methods: A web-based questionnaire survey (SurveyGizmo.com) was
   developed and validated to query the utilization of CDR +/- D-dimer in
   suspected PE. Key stakeholders identified from national VA mailing lists
   of radiology, pulmonary, and emergency medicine chiefs were sent an
   email describing the survey and provided a link for response. This study
   was reviewed and approved by our local institutional review board and
   accessing the link represented consent for participation. No personally
   identifiable data were collected and a drawing for a gift card was
   provided as an incentive.
   Results: There were a total of 159 responses, with 120 fully completed
   surveys for analysis. The majority of respondents were chiefs (63\%)
   with 11 + years of experience (80\%), from hospitals with house staff
   (86\%) and an emergency department (97\%). Respondents were from
   emergency medicine (31\%), pulmonary (27\%), radiology (26\%), and other
   departments (9\%). The overwhelming majority of respondents (85\%) did
   not require results of a CDR +/- D-dimer before ordering a CTPA. Only
   6.7\% required a CDR + D-dimer, with others requiring either only a CDR
   (5.8\%) or D-dimer (2.5\%). The most common CDR was the Wells score,
   with only one using the Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria. Nine of 18
   (50\%) regional Veterans Integrated Service Networks reported at least
   one site requiring a CDR before CTPA. An average of 9.6 CTPAs were
   estimated to be performed per week. Sorted by CDR and D-dimer use, 8
   (CDR + D-dimer), 6.9 (CDR only), 8 (D-dimer only), 10.1 (no
   requirements) CTPA studies were performed weekly. The average CTPA yield
   for PE was estimated at 11.9\% (CDR + D-dimer), 8\% (CDR only), 2.5\%
   (D-dimer only), and 7.6\% (no requirements).
   Conclusions: The vast majority of hospitals within the VA system do not
   use a CDR +/- D-dimer in the evaluation of patients with suspected PE.
   Utilization of a CDR and D-dimer may decrease CTPA utilization and
   increase yield, but this assessment is limited by the scope of the
   survey.
   Clinical Implications: CDR-guided strategies are recommended in the
   evaluation of suspected PE. Adherence within the VA healthcare system is
   very low. Further investigation is warranted to better characterize and
   improve the adherence to CDR-guided strategies and CTPA utilization.}},

Abstract = {{Landscapes are changing, with rural areas becoming increasingly
   urbanized. Children and adolescents are underrepresented in the
   sense-of-place literature. Our study aimed to understand how adolescent
   residents of a rural-urban transition area perceive and value their
   urbanizing landscape by examining sense of place and perceptions of
   landscape change. A Public Participation GIS approach, accompanied by a
   questionnaire survey, was applied to elicit responses from a sample of
   747 students aged 12-18 in Colmenar Viejo, Madrid (Spain). Respondents'
   sense of ``self-in-place{''} or home range was small, around 1 km,
   although valued places were identified up to around 17 km away, and
   occasionally further afield. Most responses were associated with urban
   land, with clear difference between the urban core, strongly associated
   with emotions, and the suburbs, with activities. Functional locations
   (i.e. sports facilities) and places which were valued for their social
   meaning (i.e. shopping malls), could be differentiated. Students were
   perceptive about change processes in the urban area, but not about those
   on the peripheral semi-natural land. Younger children were less aware
   than older children of spaces outside of the town and carried out fewer
   activities there. Females carried out fewer outdoor activities than male
   adolescents. In contrast to the adult population, students were more
   strongly focused on urban areas than on their surrounding rural
   landscapes. Here, awareness-raising and incentives are needed,
   particularly those encouraging females into the use of areas beyond the
   urban land. Our results suggest a lack of meaningful integration between
   the core city and the periphery, with lessons for urban planners.}},

Abstract = {{Survey-based welfare measures for public goods are often very sensitive
   to value elicitation methods, for example, whether the elicitation is

   question. Leading hypotheses for elicitation effects are tied to either
   behavioral factors (e.g., psychological cues) or differences in
   perceived economic incentives. Past research that emphasizes behavioral
   drivers does not precisely control economic incentives, potentially
   confounding inferences. We conduct an experiment that controls economic
   incentives through incentive-compatible elicitation methods and compare
   single binary choice, double-bounded binary choice, payment card, and
   open-ended response formats. Our experiment retains important field
   survey characteristics, including the valuation of an environmental
   public good with passive-use value. All formats elicit statistically
   indistinguishable WTP distributions, suggesting that behavioral factors
   may not be the primary drivers of elicitation effects. To the extent
   that our laboratory methods can be mirrored in the field, this offers a
   pathway for mitigating elicitation effects.}},

Month = {{FEB 22}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   This paper aims to investigate the motivating and dissuading factors,
   which develop consumers' attitude towards permission based marketing.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A conceptual model is proposed and validated by following the various
   studies on mobile and email marketing. A survey of 325 respondents was
   conducted in the Mumbai city, out of which 271 survey questionnaires
   were deemed fit for analysis, representing 83.38 per cent response rate.
   The researcher has used structural equation modelling to test the causal
   relationships among the constructs.
   Findings
   The results of the study indicate that increase in personal relevant
   messages, perceived monetary incentives and perceived entertainment
   increases consumers' attitude towards permission based marketing,
   whereas increase in perceived registration effort decreases consumers'
   attitude towards permission based marketing. Furthermore, contrary to
   the existing literature, perceived consumer empowerment, perceived
   intrusiveness and perceived privacy issues have no significant
   relationship with the attitude towards permission marketing. The
   findings are based on a particular region in India, so it may be
   different from previous studies.
   Originality/value
   Fewer research studies have been done to examine the motivating and
   dissuading factors developing consumers' attitude towards permission
   based marketing, therefore, the present research is conducted. After
   intensely reviewing the available literature, the factors were carefully
   chosen.}},

Abstract = {{Importance Ophthalmology faces imperatives to improve sustainability,
   but there is uncertainty about how to respond.
   Background We sought New Zealand ophthalmologists' opinions on climate
   change, sustainability and the role of ophthalmologists in responding to
   these issues, as well as information on the extent that ophthalmology
   practices are acting on sustainability.
   Design Anonymous online survey of New Zealand fellows and trainees (178)
   of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists
   (RANZCO) was conducted.
   Participants Forty-seven respondents (response rate 26\%) were included
   in the study.
   Methods Respondents were asked their level of agreement with statements
   on climate, health and sustainability and invited to comment. Current
   sustainability activities were collected from clinical leaders and
   directors of hospital departments and private practices.
   Main Outcome Measure Distribution of agreement scores was the main
   outcome measure.
   Results Agreement with mainstream positions on climate change was as
   expected. A minority of up to 19\% expressed the opinion that climate
   change was not due to human activity, and did not require mitigation.
   Younger ophthalmologists tended to have greater agreement with the need
   for broad-based political action on climate mitigation than those aged
   over 50 years. Most practices had room to improve on reducing waste,
   travel and carbon footprints.
   Conclusions and Relevance The majority of New Zealand ophthalmologists
   are concerned about anthropogenic climate change. Currently,
   sustainability is not a performance indicator for New Zealand district
   health boards, so there is limited incentive to drive improvements.
   These data form a reference point to compare future opinions and
   ophthalmology carbon footprinting.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The use of insulin pump and glucose sensor is advantageous,
   but unfortunately many experience skin problems. To reduce or overcome
   skin problems, patients use additional products or change their sets
   preterm. Therefore, the aim was to investigate costs related to skin
   problems.
   Materials and Methods: Two hundred sixty-three patients from four
   different hospitals in Denmark participated in a cross-sectional survey
   about skin problems related to insulin pump and/or glucose sensor use.
   Additional costs aside technology and diabetes treatment were calculated
   based on adhesives, patches, lotion, and preterm shifts of infusion or
   sensor sets due to skin problems. Descriptive statistics and linear
   regression were used.
   Results: The total costs for all these expenses were 11493.9 U.S.
   dollars (USD) in 145 pediatric patients and 4843 USD in 118 adult
   patients. The costs were higher in patients with, than without, skin
   problems and for skin problems due to the glucose sensor compared with
   insulin pump. Pediatric patients with eczema and/or wound due to the
   glucose sensor did cost 154.3 USD more, than patients without these skin
   problems (P < 0.01). We found a clear dose/response relationship between
   costs and severity of skin problems, especially in pediatric patients.
   Conclusions: Our data show that skin problems due to use of insulin pump
   and/or glucose sensor have significant costs on the Danish welfare
   system. This leaves an economic incentive for developing more
   skin-sensitive adhesive for the infusion set and sensors, at least for a
   certain subgroup of patients.}},

Title = {{Countering Depopulation in Kansas: An Assessment of the Rural
   Opportunity Zone Program}},
Journal = {{POPULATION RESEARCH AND POLICY REVIEW}},
Abstract = {{Many rural areas throughout the Great Plains, including Kansas, have
   been affected by ``brain drain{''} or the out-migration of well-educated
   people. In response to this negative outlook, in 2012, Kansas
   implemented the Rural Opportunity Zone (ROZ) Program to encourage
   college-educated adults to move to the state's rural counties. This
   brief aims to identify what influences individuals to participate in the
   program and what types of individuals are likely to participate. This
   study employed a survey of Kansas State University students and
   interviews with local officials who manage the program. Survey results
   reveal that most students do not view themselves as likely to
   participate in the program despite its financial incentives. Students
   likely to participate come from ROZ counties, are likely to find
   employment in rural areas, and hold positive views of rural life.
   Interviews with county officials revealed that the program primarily
   benefits individuals who had already intended to live in a rural area,
   and that the program rarely attracts newcomers. The program is poorly
   funded in many counties, and a lack of high-paying jobs limits growth in
   a way that the ROZ cannot outweigh. This brief also highlights the need
   for changes concerning the program's benefits and awareness.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: This study tested relationships between health and well-being
   best practices and 3 types of outcomes. Design: A cross-sectional design
   used data from the HERO Scorecard Benchmark Database. Setting: Data were
   voluntarily provided by employers who submitted web-based survey
   responses. Sample: Analyses were limited to 812 organizations that
   completed the HERO Scorecard between January 12, 2015 and October 2,
   2017. Measures: Independent variables included organizational and
   leadership support, program comprehensiveness, program integration, and
   incentives. Dependent variables included participation rates, health and
   medical cost impact, and perceptions of organizational support.
   Analysis: Three structural equation models were developed to investigate
   the relationships among study variables. Results: Model sample size
   varied based on organizationally reported outcomes. All models fit the
   data well (comparative fit index > 0.96). Organizational and leadership
   support was the strongest predictor (P < .05) of participation (n = 276
   organizations), impact (n = 160 organizations), and perceived
   organizational support (n = 143 organizations). Incentives predicted
   participation in health assessment and biometric screening (P < .05).
   Program comprehensiveness and program integration were not significant
   predictors (P > .05) in any of the models. Conclusion: Organizational
   and leadership support practices are essential to produce participation,
   health and medical cost impact, and perceptions of organizational
   support. While incentives influence participation, they are likely
   insufficient to yield downstream outcomes. The overall study design
   limits the ability to make causal inferences from the data.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{258}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Flexible energy demand (demand response, DR) is seen as one solution to
   integrate intermittent renewable energy sources into future energy
   systems.
   We provide a comprehensive analysis of the DR potential of the service
   sector, using a transparent bottom-up approach, along with quantitative
   survey data from a large sample size of over 1500 German companies. This
   allows us to estimate the theoretical and technical potentials and to
   representatively quantify the willingness of the companies to
   participate in DR, determining the practical potential. We identified
   food retail as well as restaurants as most promising subsectors, based
   on the availability of flexible appliances and control technologies and
   their willingness to conduct automated DR. Taking cross-cutting flexible
   appliances in the subsectors offices, trade and hotels/restaurants into
   account, our estimations result in approximately 22 TWh of theoretical
   potential (similar to 35\% of total electricity consumption of the
   subsectors), 4 TWh of technical potential and 1 TWh of practical
   potential. Relevant barriers to DR are its perceived low priority and
   inadequate financial incentives due to a small share of energy costs
   within firms, whereas customer image of DR is perceived as an important
   driver. Knowledge of barriers and drivers is valuable for designing
   policies, which incorporate the needs of applicants and enable companies
   to participate in DR. Across European countries, the structure and share
   of electricity demand of the service sector is fairly comparable (with
   differences arising from climatic context); hence the insights derived
   here are in its main conclusions also relevant for the entirety of
   Europe.}},

Abstract = {{Noncognitive skills (e.g., persistence and self-control) are typically
   measured using self-reported questionnaires in which respondents rate
   their own skills. In many applications-including program evaluation and
   school accountability systems-such reports are assumed to measure only
   the skill of interest. However, self-reports might also capture other
   dimensions aside from the skill, such as aspects of a respondent's
   situation, which could include incentives and the conditions in which
   they complete the questionnaire. To explore this possibility, this study
   conducted 2 experiments to estimate the extent to which survey
   administration conditions can affect student responses on noncognitive
   skill questionnaires. The first experiment tested whether providing
   information about the importance of noncognitive skills to students
   directly affects their responses, and the second experiment tested
   whether incentives tied to performance on another task indirectly affect
   responses. Both experiments suggest that self-reports of noncognitive
   skills are sensitive to survey conditions. The effects of the conditions
   are relatively large compared with those found in the program evaluation
   literature, ranging from 0.05 to 0.11 5Ds. These findings suggest that
   the effects of interventions or other social policies on self-reported
   noncognitive skills should be interpreted with caution.}},

Pages = {{1-20}},
Abstract = {{The study investigates the awareness, practices and attitudes of
   researchers in regard to open data - i.e. the sharing and reuse of
   research data - which is part of a larger study that concentrated on the
   scholarly communication readiness of Malaysian researchers in Open
   Science. The data were gathered by means of a survey which obtained 135
   responses from researchers based in five research universities in
   Malaysia. The main conclusions are: (a) the researchers are aware of
   open data, yet, they are not practising it as shown in the mean scores,
   as well as in their responses towards the statements asked; (b) unclear
   information on data privacy policy, misuse of data, and the fear of
   losing publication opportunity are part of disincentives for data
   sharing. The requisite for open data understanding, practices and
   attitudinal change is needed for these may impact research practices,
   government policies and scientific knowledge, leading to research
   transparency and accountability, social benefit and economic growth.
   This paper concludes with a discussion that policies incentivizing the
   sharing and reuse of open data, as well as tools and guidance to support
   data sharing, and a strong incentives and rewards to implement open data
   among researchers, should be encouraged. Future studies should look into
   the importance of rewards for data sharing among researchers'
   institutions. Studies bridging the gap between policy and practices of
   open data should be examined, if true openness in research is to be
   established in Malaysia.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: This study is a part of an effort to determine the
   challenges faced by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) radiographers towards
   role extension and advanced practice. It reflects the current practice
   and challenges facing role extension compared to international
   advancement. The study aimed to assess the radiographers who worked at
   mammography screening perception and readiness to accept role extension
   and advanced practice in mammography.
   Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study using an online survey was
   conducted among radiographers who practice mammography. The survey
   captured demographics, qualifications, professional education, future
   development plans, interest in role extension, and incentive to pursue
   the mammography profession.
   Results: Forty-five radiographers were invited to participate in the
   study the response rate was 71\% (n=32), 34.4 (11\%) were UAE nationals
   with the remainder being expats. The majority were young between 25 and
   45 years old (84.4\%), 81.3\% hold a BSc qualification. 56.3\% completed
   a post-qualification training specialized mammography certificate. 81\%
   of the participants showed interest in role extension after appropriate
   education, training, and supervision by radiologists.
   Conclusion: This study reports on the perceptions and readiness of
   radiographers on advanced practice within breast-screening centers. The
   results show acceptance and support after proper training, clear career
   pathway, and licensing body recognition. The role of the radiographer in
   the UAE is still growing.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we examine rates of careless responding and reactions to

   internet-based surveys in sociological and political research. Second,
   we include a voluntary opt-in panel (without monetary incentive) well
   suited for conducting survey experiments (e.g., factorial surveys).
   Respondents' reactions to the detection items are analyzed by objective,
   nonreactive indicators (i.e., break-off, item nonresponse, and
   measurement quality), and two self-report scales. Our reaction analyses
   reveal that the detection methods we applied are not only well suited
   for identifying careless respondents, but also exert a motivational
   rather than a demotivating influence on respondents' answer behavior
   and, hence, contribute to data quality. Furthermore, we find that
   break-off behavior differs across both samples suggesting that results
   from methodological online studies on the basis of incentivized samples
   do not necessarily transfer to online studies in general.}},

   total hour requirement, and preceptor incentives and barriers.
   Findings: There was a 47\% survey response rate. Variation in processes

Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Objective. To determine how changes to the student evaluation of
   teaching (SET) survey instrument and process at a college of pharmacy
   contributed to improved student response rates and to understand how the
   process could be further refined.
   Methods. Pharmacy students from the class of 2018 who had participated
   in both the old and new SET process were recruited to participate in one
   of four focus group interviews. An inductive approach was used for data
   collection and analysis. A focus group guide was created based on two
   major domains: comparing changes between the old and new SET process and
   survey form, and determining how the new SET process could be further
   refined.
   Results. In South Jordan, UT, six students participated in one of the
   focus groups and seven students participated in the other focus group.
   In Henderson, NV, seven students participated in each of the two focus
   groups. Twenty-seven total students participated in the four focus
   groups across two campuses. Students stated that reducing the number of
   questions on each SET survey instrument and using a 5-point rather than
   a 10-point Likert scale were positive changes. The changes also
   motivated them to complete the surveys, which improved overall response
   rates. Although students reported that the monetary incentive
   (contributions toward the cost of the class banquet) that had been added
   to the new SET process was a strong motivator, the incentive itself
   would have likely been insufficient without the other changes. Several
   participants stated that receiving feedback from faculty members on
   changes made to teaching materials based upon previous student
   evaluations was also an important motivator for students to continue
   completing the surveys.
   Conclusion. Students identified several motivators for SET
   participation. Improving the process for survey completion is essential
   to improve response rates to more accurately represent the feedback of
   the entire student body. Additionally, the evaluation process must
   ensure that the data gathered are robust, accurate, and insightful, to
   be of good use of student and faculty time.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Social isolation, loneliness and anxiety-depressive states
   are emerging health conditions in the elderly. Research question: To
   assess whether a 4-month programme of physical activity in a group
   improves the emotional, social and quality of life situation in a sample
   of subjects over 64 years old people. Methods: Multi-centre randomized
   clinical trial of two groups. Study population: Patients older than 64
   years assigned to three primary care teams from different locations.
   Inclusion criteria: Submit a score <32 on the DUKE-UNC-11 social support
   scale, or >12 on the Beck Depression Scale, or >10 on the Generalized
   Anxiety Scale (GAD-7), at the start of the study. The intervention group
   participated in a group physical activity program for 4-months that
   consisted of progressively walking sessions two days a week, 60-150
   minutes long depending on the physical condition of each participant.
   Results: Enrolled were 94 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Mean
   age was 74 years (SD 5.18) and 76.6\% were women. No significant
   differences were found at the beginning of the study between the two
   groups in relation to the outcome of the scales evaluated. Once the
   intervention was completed, improvement in the quality of life and
   social support was detected in the intervention group (p<.05). Both
   groups improved the depression and anxiety clinic but the improvement in
   the participants of the intervention group was higher. Those with
   initial depression improved 8.6 points on the scale, compared to the
   control that improved 3.3 points, with the final average of 17.4. Those
   who presented initial anxiety improved 8 points (final average: 7.5
   points, cut-off point for the diagnosis of anxiety 10), compared to the
   control that improved 5.1 points. Conclusion: The results of this study
   indicate that the program developed has positive effects on improving
   the quality of life, social support and depression and anxiety clinic.
   Background: Tourism represents 45\% gross domestic product in Balearic
   Islands. Working as a hotel housekeeper (HH) has been associated with
   important morbidity, especially musculoskeletal, chronic pain, a
   significant number of sick leaves, a high consumption of medication,
   poor psychological well-being and worse quality of life. Research
   question: Explore perceptions and opinions regarding the HH's work and
   health problems. Estimate and evaluate HH's health determinants, the
   exposition to several occupational risk factors, their lifestyles and
   health problems and their quality of life. Methods: Design: mixed
   methods: (1) exploratory qualitative study (QS) including 10
   semi-structured interviews and six focus groups; (2). descriptive study
   (DS): individual interviews and clinical medical records. Inclusion
   criteria: older than 18 years, had worked during the last summer season
   in the Balearic Islands. Analysis: QS: transcription and content
   analysis; DS: descriptive statistical analysis. Results: QS: Identified
   positive aspects of their work: timetables, relationship with
   co-workers, attending clients. Highlighted negative aspects: working
   conditions, hard physical workload, stressful duties and insufficiently
   rewarded. HH associated their health problems with their work; coping
   strategies: self-medication or visiting their general practitioner. DS:
   1.043 HH included. Mean age 43.3 years, mean working years as HH 10.7
   years. Mean rooms/day: 18.1 (+/- 6.5); mean beds/day: 44.6 (+/- 20.7).
   HH reported often pain during the last summer season: 68.2\% (IC 95\%
   65.3-71.0) low back pain; 60.9\% (IC 95\% 57.8-63.8) wrist and hands;
   55.3\% (IC 95\% 52.2-58.3) cervical. 41.6\% and 35.1\% self-reported
   regular and poor health status, respectively. Conclusion: HH perceived
   hard and stressful working conditions, partly justified by the number of
   rooms and beds made per day. They also perceived health problems related
   to their work. HH frequently reported pain during the last summer
   season. Moreover, they perceive regular or poor health status, weaker
   than women from the same social class do.
   Background: Gender-based violence (GBV) is a public health and human
   rights issue, being highly prevalent (12-51\%), repetitive and having a
   severe impact on women's health, with a high sanitary and social cost.
   Primary care has a key role in detection and management. There is low
   detection and delay in diagnosis. There is a lack of preparation to
   recognize abuse, especially in the approach and action after detection.
   Greater awareness and sensitization is required. Research question: Can
   a brief specific training intervention in GBV imparted to primary health
   care professionals in their primary health centre increase knowledge,
   improve attitudes and skills? Methods: A cluster-randomized clinical
   trial was carried out in Vigo area primary health centres with at least
   20 health care professionals. A basal evaluation was made through a
   validated inquiry (PREMIS), which they had to retake after three months.
   In the intervention centres, a clinical session was imparted. pResults:
   Out of 264 primary health care professionals, 145 participated. There
   was a 63.5\% loss out of 145 professionals. A statistically significant
   difference was detected in the field of knowledge, increasing an average
   of two points on a scale from 0 to 5 in these aspects: how to make
   appropriate questions; connections between GBV and pregnancy; why do not
   they leave their partners; risk determination and phases of GBV. There
   was also a decrease in the idea that if the patient does not recognize
   gender violence, there is very little that can be done. No significant
   differences were detected in the detection and follow-up. Conclusion:
   Significant differences were found in the knowledge and attitude
   sections after performing the intervention to the professionals. The
   results support the implementation of continuous brief training on GBV
   in primary care.
   Background: Out-of-hours (OOH) primary care is a topic of great interest
   in European countries. Reasons for this are similar across borders: to
   guarantee continuity of care with decreasing numbers of health care
   workers and to guard equity in OOHcare for all patients. In OOHcare
   research, valid and accessible research data are needed to fill the
   knowledge gap. iCAREdata aims to offer valid and immediately available
   information from OOHcare. Research question: How feasible is it to
   collect, store and link data of different OOH services in Belgium and to
   improve data quality registration? How useful are aggregated data to
   inform stakeholders, to evaluate (the quality of) services in OOH care
   and the effects of interventions? Methods: As a first achievement, data
   flows, encryption and encoding were carefully designed and implemented.
   Solid cooperation with the federal eHealth web services as a trusted
   third party was crucial. Ethical approval and approval by the data
   protection authority was obtained. Clear agreements were established
   concerning access control. A strict code of conduct was agreed upon. A
   steering committee was established to guard the procedures. Results:
   First data were collected in 2015. iCAREdata now receives +/- 3000
   unique patient contacts per weekend, spread over 14 general practice
   cooperatives, and covering about a quarter of the Flemish population.
   Aggregated data, directly processed, are provided weekly on . This
   portal site offers an overview of, among others, the latest diagnostics,
   drug prescriptions and workload. iCAREdata project also collects data
   from emergency departments in hospitals and community pharmacists and
   link them to evaluate further OOH primary care. Conclusion: Developing a
   research database on OOHcare is feasible. The iCAREdata project succeeds
   in an automated output every week, offering insights on the evolution of
   morbidity, services and effects of interventions. Careful validation and
   interpretation of the data is a crucial ongoing challenge.
   Background: More than half of decompensations of heart failure are
   attended in primary care setting. No score that helps to ascertain the
   short-term prognosis in these patients. Research question: To develop
   and validate a short-term score (30 days) to predict hospitalizations or
   death in patients attended in primary care as a consequence of
   decompensation of heart failure, based on variables easily measurable in
   primary care setting Methods: Prospective multinational cohort study
   including patients treated because of a heart failure decompensation in
   primary care setting. There were a derivation (Spain) and a validation
   cohort (nine European countries). Results: The derivation cohort
   included 561 patients, women were 56\%, mean age was 82.2 (SD 8.03)
   years and 31.5\% of patients were hospitalized or died in the first
   month. In the validation cohort, 238 patients were included, women were
   54\%, mean age was 79.0 (10.4) years and 26.9\% of patients were
   hospitalized or died in the first month. According to the multivariate
   models, sex, age, hospital admission due to heart failure the previous
   year, and a heart rate greater than 100 beats/minute, orthopnoea,
   paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, NYHA functional stage III or IV,
   saturation of oxygen lower than 90\% or an increase in the dyspnoea at
   the consultation with the General practitioner were included in the
   HEFESTOS-SCORE. The multivariate model including these variables showed
   a good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow p=.35) and discrimination (AUC 0.81,
   95\% CI 0.77-0.85). In the validation cohort, the model presented an
   adequate external validation with good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow
   p=.35) and discrimination (AUC 0.74, 95\% CI 0.67-0.82). Conclusion: The
   HEFESTOS-SCORE, based on clinical and demographical variables easily
   measurable in primary care is a useful tool to stratify the short-term
   hospitalization and mortality in patients attended because of a heart
   failure decompensation.
   Background: Despite recommendations against long-term benzodiazepine
   (BZD) use, they are often prescribed during months or years in primary
   care. Research question: To determine facilitators and barriers that
   explain the variation in implementation of a primary care educational
   and feedback intervention targeted to general practitioners (GPs) to
   reduce BZDs prescriptions. Methods: A hybrid type I clinical trial:
   qualitative data to evaluate the implementation outcomes. Three health
   districts of Spain: Balearic Islands, Tarragona-Reus district
   (Catalonia) and Arnau de Vilanova lliria district (Valencia). Forty
   stakeholders (GPs) participated in five focus groups; they were selected
   based on their effectiveness of the intervention results: high (three
   groups) or low (two groups) and individual interviews to two GP of low
   efficiency. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research
   (CFIR) was used to guide collection and analysis of qualitative data.
   Two researchers evaluated the qualitative data of the focus groups by
   the Codebook and Rating Rules of CFIR, independently. Results: Of the 31
   CFIR constructs assessed, three constructs strongly distinguished
   between GPs with low versus high success of the intervention
   (intervention complexity, individual state of change, key stakeholders
   engaging), seven additional constructs weakly distinguished
   (adaptability, external policy and incentives, implementation climate,
   compatibility, relative priority, self-efficacy, formally appointed
   internal implementation leaders), 10 had insufficient data to assess and
   11 were non-related to the success of the intervention. Conclusion: We
   identified the constructs that explain the variation in the
   effectiveness of the intervention; this information is relevant to
   redesign successful implementation strategies focused on these
   constructs to implement the BENZORED intervention in health services.
   Background: Despite recommendations against long-term benzodiazepine
   (BZD) use, they are often prescribed during months or years in primary
   care. Research question: To evaluate the effectiveness of a primary care
   educational and feedback intervention targeted to general practitioners
   (GPs) to reduce BZDs prescriptions. Methods: Design: A two-arm parallel
   cluster randomized clinical trial. Settings: Primary Healthcare centres
   from three health districts of Spain: Balearic Islands (IbSalut),
   Catalonia (Institut Catala de la Salut; Tarragona-Reus district) and
   Community of Valencia (Conselleria de Salut Universal; Arnau de Vilanova
   lliria district). Participants: All GPs from the health districts
   included were invited to participate. Ninety percent of the GPs accepted
   to participate. Intervention: GPs received an educational two hours
   workshop training about the rationale for prescribing BZDs and
   deprescribing strategies for long-term BZD users, audit and monthly
   feedback about their prescription and access to a support web page with
   information to help them and leaflets to give to the patients. Control
   group: GPs did not receive any component of the intervention. Outcomes:
   Defined daily dose (DDD)/1000 inhabitants/year (DHD) of BZDs prescribed
   by GP at 12 months. Proportion of long-term BZD users (>6 months) and in
   patients aged 65 or more at 12 months. Statistical analysis: Generalized
   mixed linear random effect models to account for clustering at the level
   of healthcare centre and all analyses were based on an intention to
   treat principle. Results: We included 749 GPs and 49 (6.5\%) were lost
   to follow-up. Adjusted difference between groups in DHD at 12 months was
   -3.26 (-4.87;-1.65), p<.001. The differences in the proportion of
   long-term BZD users was -0.39 (-0.58;-0.19), p<.001 and in patients
   older than 65 was -0.87 (-1.35;-0.26), p=.004. Conclusion: An
   educational and feedback intervention targeted to GPs is effective to
   reduce BZD prescription in primary care.
   Background: Patients who might also go to the general practitioner (GP)
   frequently consult emergency departments (ED). This leads to decreased
   efficiency, high workload at the ED and additional costs for both
   government and patient. Research question: The primary outcome is the
   proportion of patients who enter the ED and are handled by the GP after
   triage. Secondary outcomes: Referral rate to the ED by the GP,
   proportion of patients not following the triage advice, compliance of
   the nurse to the triage-instructions and health insurance expenditures.
   Furthermore, facilitators and barriers will be studied and an incident
   analysis will be performed. Methods: This is a randomised controlled
   trial with weekends serving as clusters. Patients presenting at the ED
   during OOH are triaged and allocated to either ED or GP by a trained
   nurse using an extension to the Manchester Triage System (MTS). During
   control clusters, all patients remain at the ED. Data are collected
   using a database for OOH care (iCAREdata). Results: So far, 296 out of
   2733 (11\%) patients were allocated to the GP. Two-thirds (194) of these
   patients did go to the GP leading to a primary outcome of 7\% for 14
   intervention weekends. Only eight patients were referred back to the ED.
   Compliance of the nurse to the extended MTS was 93\%, in 6\% of the
   cases the nurse chose ED instead of GPC and in less than one percent GPC
   instead of ED. The nurses chose higher urgency categories and more
   discriminators, leading to the GP during intervention clusters. Using an
   automated system, these results are updated weekly, on our poster, we
   will show more results that are complete. Conclusion: These first
   results reveal a low efficiency but a high safety of the intervention.
   More prolonged data collection combined with a process analysis and cost
   efficiency study is necessary before definitive conclusions can be
   drawn.
   Background: Low back pain is a multifactorial condition with individual
   and societal impact. Psychosocial factors play a larger prognostic roll.
   Therefore, earlier multidisciplinary treatment strategy (physical,
   psychological and social/occupational) could be applied to search
   improvement in fear-avoidance beliefs with positive effect in the
   evolution of low back pain. Research question: Evaluate the
   effectiveness of a biopsychosocial multidisciplinary intervention
   (physiotherapy, cognitive-behavioural and pharmacological therapy)
   through the changes in fear-avoidance beliefs (FABs), in working
   population with sub-acute non-specific LBP, compared to usual clinical
   care at 3 and 12 months. Methods: A cluster randomised clinical trial,
   conducted in 39 Primary Health Care Centres (PHCC) in Barcelona.
   Participants between 18 and 65 years old (n = 369; control group =188,
   PHCC 26 and intervention group =181, PHCC 13). Control group received
   usual care, according to guidelines. Intervention group received usual
   care plus a biopsychosocial multidisciplinary intervention (sessions 10
   hours/total). The main outcome was the Fear-Avoidance Beliefs
   questionnaire (FABQ). Other outcomes: Evolution to chronicity.
   Assessment at baseline, 3 and 12 months. Analysis was by intention to
   treat and analyst blinded. Multiple imputations. Results: Of the 369
   enrolled patients with LBP, 421 (84.0\%) provided data at the three
   months of follow-up, and 387 (77.2\%) at 12 months. Mean age of study
   subjects at baseline was 45.1 (SD: 10.4) years-old and 61.2\% were
   women. At baseline, there were no differences. Both groups showed a
   decrease in FABQ (FAB physical and FAB-work) at three months and twelve
   months, with a significant difference at long-term. At FAB-physical
   performance, there was no significant difference over the follow-up time
   and at FAB-Work, a substantial difference at 12 months between groups.
   Conclusion: A multidisciplinary biopsychosocial intervention showed a
   positive effect in FABs by improving fear behaviours and avoidance at
   work.
   Community participation in primary healthcare is enshrined in
   international policies since the 1970s and has been re-emphasised since
   then, most recently in the 2018 WHO Astana Declaration (). The concept
   comes from a social justice perspective. It emphasises that the
   participation of communities who experience poverty and social exclusion
   is essential to the development of primary health care services shaping
   these services and making them relevant to those with the greatest need.
   This is important if we are to address the well-documented Inverse Care
   Law. There is, however, a translational gap between policy and practice.
   The stability of policies for community participation in primary
   healthcare is patchy. The implementation of policies into conventional
   ways of working is patchy. Where implementation has occurred, the
   coverage of community participation initiatives can be patchy - not all
   community members are involved. The literature shows a pattern of
   exclusion whereby so-called `hard to reach' groups are not adequately
   involved in primary healthcare decision-making. This is the case for
   refugees and migrants who arrive to settle and integrate into host
   countries in Europe. The recent WHO Strategy and Action Plan for Refugee
   and Migrant Health (2016; ) is a call for action to disrupt this pattern
   of exclusion and improve the health of refugees and migrants. Drawing on
   the rich tradition of participatory health research is a valuable way
   forward because it provides important concepts, tools and techniques for
   research that is more inclusive and primary care practice. This
   presentation will describe innovative examples of success in family
   practice settings from around Europe. These have brought together
   refugees and migrants with primary care stakeholders and enabled them to
   work together to introduce and sustain changes in clinical practice.
   This evidence can be used to guide and strengthen community
   participation in primary healthcare, for all.
   Background: Community participation is essential for effective
   implementation of research programmes in primary healthcare (PHC) but
   also appropriate interpretation of results and optimal delivery of
   subsequent care. Stakeholder engagement undertaken under defined and
   evaluated frameworks may be key for the establishment of concrete
   collaboration and communication between communities and other parties
   involved in research. This abstract aims to report on community and
   stakeholder engagement methodologies, plans and activities of European
   research projects conducted in Crete, Greece. Research question: Could a
   consensus be reached regarding the methods and tools for enhancing
   stakeholder engagement in community-oriented PHC research? Methods:
   Examined programmes included RESTORE (FP7), FRESH AIR (Horizon2020) and
   VIGOUR (Health Programme). Identified methodologies included
   Normalisation Process Theory, Participatory Learning and Action, Five
   Steps of Stakeholders' Engagement, establishment of Stakeholder
   Engagement Groups under the 9 C's model (commissioners, customers,
   collaborators, contributors, channels, commentators, consumers,
   champions, competitors) and Structured Democratic Dialogue. These were
   implemented to a range of stakeholders, including community members,
   patients, migrants, Roma populations, healthcare professionals and
   policy-makers. Qualitative research (focus groups, individual
   interviews) and Thematic Content Analysis were used for design and
   analysis of engagement activities. Results: In RESTORE, migrants and
   other stakeholders selected guidelines and training supporting
   cross-cultural communication in PHC consultations, based on their own
   needs and expectations. Community members, healthcare professionals and
   healthcare authorities were actively involved in FRESH AIR by
   identifying local priorities and contextual factors for designing
   project interventions, providing access to communities and supporting
   dissemination of project achievements. In VIGOUR, multidisciplinary
   stakeholders were brought together and formulated a joint ambition
   statement for the future of integrated care in Crete. Conclusion:
   Various stakeholder engagement methods with documented effects are
   currently available. Their systematic identification, appraisal,
   synthesis and consolidation may serve with enhancing community
   participation in PHC, sustaining research results and translating
   findings into appropriate actions.
   Background: Screening for prostate cancer remains controversial,
   implying a trade-off between benefits and harms, and a shared
   decision-making process has been advocated. Decision aids are
   evidence-based tools that improve decision quality. For limited-resource
   countries, translating and making cultural adaptations to high-quality
   decision aids is a reasonable alternative to developing new ones.
   Research question: We aimed to translate and culturally adapt an English
   language patient decision aid addressing prostate cancer screening, so
   that Portuguese men can use it. Methods: We followed the European Centre
   for Disease Prevention and Control's (ECDC) five-step, stakeholder-based
   approach to adapting health communication materials: (1) selection of
   materials and process coordinators; (2) early review; (3) translation
   and back translation; (4) comprehension testing with cognitive
   semi-structured interviews; (5) proofreading. Cognitive interviews were
   conducted with 15 men, ages 55-69, from the Oporto district local
   community to refine the decision aid after its translation. Content
   analysis was performed using Ligre (TM) software. Results: Five main
   themes are presented: informational content, information comprehension,
   socio-cultural appropriateness, feelings and primary message, and
   personal perspective concerning prostate cancer screening. For each
   theme, illustrative quotes extracted from men's interviews are
   presented. Most men found the translated version of the decision aid to
   be clear, comprehensive and appropriate for its target population,
   albeit some suggested that medical terms could be a barrier. The data
   collected from men's interviews allowed the researchers to clarify
   concepts and expand existing content. Conclusion: The final version of
   the decision aid can be used in the real world clinical setting and our
   ECDC based approach can be replicated by other workgroups to translate
   and culturally adapt decision aids.
   What are we talking about when we talk about value? In 2006, Michael
   Porter and Elizabeth O. Teisberg published; Redefining Health Care,
   Creating Value-Based Competition on Results, Harvard Business School
   Press. Affirming that payers and providers, including doctors and
   nurses, are very concerned in demonstrating that they work a lot, and
   very little, or nothing, in assessing what their work contributes to the
   health of people and communities. Michael Porter is famous in the
   business world for his work on competitiveness based on the value of
   products and services. He has introduced this concept in the provision
   of health services, all summarised in a phrase: Health systems should
   seek to obtain the maximum possible value for the health of people for
   every dollar they spend. However, to define the value in healthcare, the
   patient must be introduced into the equation, so, in Porterian terms,
   the value is the perception that people have about clinical
   effectiveness and the costs of therapeutic processes. Clinical
   effectiveness is measurable from epidemiology (to be readmitted to a
   hospital fewer times or living longer); value, on the other hand, is
   reflected by people's experience. We need to ask questions such as do
   patients with advanced diseases want to live longer, or they want to
   enjoy the highest quality of life possible. Depending on the response,
   we can develop different delivery models. What is value-based
   healthcare? According to NEJM Catalyst, Value-based healthcare is a
   healthcare delivery model in which providers, including hospitals and
   physicians, are paid based on patient health outcomes (). Under
   value-based care agreements, providers are rewarded for helping patients
   improve their health, reduce the effects and incidence of chronic
   disease, and live healthier lives in an evidence-based way. How to
   achieve a Value-Based Healthcare Model The following six drivers are the
   key to make a primary health care system a value-based healthcare model:
   1. Prioritising patient-centred care. 2. From clinical pathways to care
   delivery value chains. 3. Promoting the right care and reducing medical
   overuse. 4. Turning a fragmented model into another integrated model. 5.
   Creating the enabling environment for healthcare transformation. 6.
   Fostering community health. How to develop a Value-Based Community
   Health Michael Marmot states that if the determinants of health are
   mostly social, solutions must also be social, so to improve the quality
   of community life, political systems require economic, housing,
   education, security and infrastructure programs (Am J Public Health.
   2014;104:S517-S519). Nevertheless, the healthcare system must know how
   to adjust resources according to the social circumstances of each
   community and to understand how to provide a health-oriented vision of
   all the social programs. On the other hand, community health is an
   intervention model that aims to improve the health of a defined
   community that should operate from primary care services to adjust their
   actions to the social reality of each territory.
   Background: Geriatric care needs to be increased with growing elderly
   populations. The Borgholm jurisdiction in the Baltic Island of oland
   (Kalmar region) has an older than average senior population and had
   difficulties recruiting primary care physicians (PCPs) resulting in high
   elderly hospital care consumption. Research question: Could a new model
   of geriatric care be able to decrease the hospital care needs of
   Borgholm as compared to the rest of Kalmar region? Methods: A new model
   of care was developed in Borgholm 2016-2017 where the PCP list was
   limited to 1000 patients, daily slots for PCP home care visits could be
   booked by community nurses or ambulance nurses and PCPs had daily
   anticipatory care planning contacts with Kalmar hospital staff. Results:
   Between 2014 and 2018, Borgholm home care patients >75 years old
   increased by 70\% vs. a 2\% decrease for the rest of Kalmar region.
   Similarly, Kalmar emergency department visits decreased by 19\% in
   Borgholm vs. 9\% increase for the rest of Kalmar. Also, Kalmar hospital
   care episodes decreased 7\% in Borgholm vs. 13\% increase for the rest
   of Kalmar; Kalmar hospital outpatient visits decreased 8\% in Borgholm
   vs. 21\% increase for the rest of Kalmar; total care consumption for >75
   years old decreased 4\% in Borgholm vs. a 10\% increase for the rest of
   Kalmar region. Conclusion: A new geriatric care model consisting of a
   comprehensive collaboration between strengthened primary care and
   community care, hospital care and ambulance care was associated with a
   reduction in total care consumption for senior citizens in a rural
   Swedish jurisdiction.
   Background: Primary health care, the general practitioner, plays a
   critical role for early identification and care of patients with
   dementia. Early diagnosis of dementia allows starting therapy and
   improving the quality of life of the patients. Research question: To
   estimate the prevalence and care of patients with dementia in North
   Macedonia. Methods: Forty-six general practitioners (GPs) surgeries from
   20 cities in Macedonia took part in the project. All individuals age
   over 65 years with a diagnosis of dementia were identified from GP
   electronic disease registers. Results: Based on the diagnosis, 450
   (3.5\%) patients were identified from a total population of 12,926 over
   65s. The most common dementia was Alzheimer's dementia 294 (65.3\%)
   followed by vascular dementia 27.11\%. The average age of respondents in
   the study was 77.5 +/- 8.2 years, with 50\% patients under the age of 79
   years, 65.6\% were female and 68.4\% were with elementary school. In the
   entire sample, most of the patients diagnosed with dementia 195 (43.3\%)
   said they lived with another family member. The most common risk factor
   was hypertension (85.1\%), followed by stroke/ transitory ischemic
   attacks (29.3\%) and equal percentage, i.e. 26.4\% of patients had high
   levels of cholesterol and diabetes. To 242 (53.8\%) acetylcholinesterase
   inhibitors were prescribed (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine), 77
   (17.1\%) memantine, while 247 (54.9\%) another OTC therapy. 227 (50.4\%)
   reported that they did not receive treatment. An additional analysis of
   the reasons for not receiving treatment was made on this sample of
   patients who did not receive treatment. It was found that in the
   majority of these patients (more than 50\%) the reason for not receiving
   therapy was that it was not prescribed, in 142 (62.6\%). Conclusion:
   This is the first national representative study of dementia prevalence
   in North Macedonia. Those data can provide information for healthcare
   needs people with dementia.
   Background: Emotional experience for medical students during clinical
   internships is often ignored. Yet, its influence on professional skills
   is certain. Research question: `What is the emotional experience of
   second and third-year medical students during their first clinical
   internship? How do they perceive the management of their experience by
   their supervisors?' Methods: A qualitative study was conducted with 12
   students in their second or third year of medical training at the
   University of Lille, in France, between 2016 and 2019. Interviews were
   carried out comprehensively for a total of 17 hours. Following a
   grounded theory approach, the analysis terminated when data were
   sufficient to offer a conclusive model. Results: Emotional experience
   during clinical internship was rich and intense. It was most often
   ignored and was not taken into account in the development of
   professional skills. The organized management was deficient. Informal
   training existed: when a wilful student met a dedicated teacher.
   Students would have welcomed a possibility to experience intense
   emotions in a protective environment, and only then in an empowering
   environment. They expressed the same desire about early exchanges on the
   experiences of the internship. A modelling of the informants' emotional
   experiences was realized in the form of three diagrams. Conclusion:
   Students ask to be challenged to face patients, and then to be listened
   to about it. Possible interventions are trauma prevention and detection
   of malaise in the workplace; teaching of humanist values; providing
   experience and reflexivity through new pedagogical means (such as
   cinema, theatre, literature, writing), or relational means (such as
   exchange groups, companionship, solidarity commitment, immersive
   internships and tutoring); and training supervisors.
   Background: Oral anticoagulants (OAC) reduce the risk for stroke and
   death from all causes in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation
   (NVAF). Research question: To explore adherence rates to OAC among
   patients with NVAF and to compare head-to-head adherence rate of
   different medications in long-term chronic use. Methods: We conducted a
   population-based cohort study Clalit Health Services, Israel. All
   patients, 30 years and over, with a diagnosis of NVAF before 2016 and
   were treated with OAC were included. We included patients that filled at
   least one prescription per year in the three consecutive years
   2016-2018. We analysed all prescriptions that were filled for the
   medications from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017. We considered
   purchasing of at least nine monthly prescriptions during 2017 as `good
   medication adherence.' Results: Twenty-six thousand and twenty-nine
   patients with NVAF who were treated with OAC were identified. Ten
   thousand and two hundred and eighty-four (39.5\%) were treated with
   apixaban, 6321 (24.3\%) were treated with warfarin, 6290 (24.1\%) were
   treated with rivaroxaban 3134 (12.0\%) were treated with dabigatran.
   Rates of good medication adherence were 88.9\% for rivaroxaban, 84.9\%
   for apixaban, 83.6\% for dabigatran and 55.8\% for warfarin (p<.0001).
   Good adherence with OAC was associated with lower LDL cholesterol and
   glucose levels. Advanced age was associated with higher adherence rates
   (p<.001). SES was not associated with medication adherence. Conclusion:
   Adherence rates to DOAC among patients with NVAF are high and are higher
   than the adherence rate to warfarin. It should be taken into
   consideration when choosing OAC treatment for NVAF.
   Background: In France, cervical cancer screening by pap-smears should be
   conducted triennially. Screening statistics are based on the number of
   cytology examinations of smears reimbursed by the Health Insurance
   appearing in the claim databases. The percentage of screened women is
   lower based on these data than on declarative surveys. If surveys are
   overestimating the number of screened women, it is likely that claim
   databases underestimate it. Research question: The primary objective was
   to determine the underestimation of screened women in claim databases.
   The secondary purpose was to estimate the proportion of female patients
   not reachable by their GP for a cervical cancer screening in an
   organized screening trial. Methods: The population was the 6327 female
   patients aged 30-65 years of the 24 GP investigators of the PaCUDAHL-Ge
   trial. We compared the lists of their female patients that had no
   cytology of Pap test reimbursed during the three prior years, extracted
   from the Health Insurance claim databases in 2015 and 2018. We selected
   the patients appearing on both lists meaning they had not responded to
   the invitation of their GP to be screened in the trial. We searched in
   the GPs' records valid reasons not to be screened (hysterectomy, history
   of cervical lesion, pregnancy, other conditions making screening
   irrelevant) or evidence of screening. Results: The total number of
   `unscreened' women in 2018 was 2731, 1737 patients appeared on both
   lists, 1522 could be included for analysing, 65 had been screened, 95
   had hysterectomy, three had a history of cervical lesion, nine were
   pregnant and 10 had other conditions making screening irrelevant, 166
   patients were lost to view. Conclusion: Based on GPs' records, health
   insurance claim databases underestimate the number of screened women by
   7.6\%. The percentage of patients not responding to the invitation of
   their GP to be screened in the PaCUDAHL-Ge trial is 24.18\%.
   Background: Over the past decade, the amount of digital data created by
   humans with or without connected tools has grown exponentially. The
   field of primary care (PC) did not escape this digitization, nor the use
   of Big Data algorithms. To evaluate the results of Big Data research in
   PC it seemed useful to identify which algorithms are used. Research
   question: What are the algorithms used for Big Data research in PC
   research and how are they described? Methods: Systematic review of the
   literature according to the recommendations of the PRISMA guide. A
   search equation using the following MeSH terms `big data, data mining,
   Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning, Deep Learning,
   Neural Networks Natural Language Processing, general practice,
   electronic health records, health records' has been applied to the
   PUBMED database. After a selection of the titles and article summaries
   according to the inclusion criteria, the full versions of the eligible
   articles were read and analysed. Referenced articles of the sources
   articles were added to the analysis. The algorithms described in the
   articles were extracted and analysed. Results: In total, 778 articles
   were identified, 169 were eligible for full reading and 26 articles were
   finally selected. The algorithms listed in the articles are poorly
   described. The description is usually limited to a general explanation
   about how the algorithm works. Seven articles gave a partial description
   of the algorithm; a logic diagram was given in four articles and the
   codes in only two. Actually, only one article fully describes the
   algorithm with its mathematical description, its code and its logic
   diagram. Conclusion: Big Data algorithms in PC are not satisfactorily
   described. The lack of reproducibility is not compatible with a
   consistent scientific approach. Researchers should provide more
   information about the way they extract and analyse their data to give
   their readers more confidence in Big Data.
   Background: As a collaborative project of the Family Practice Depression
   and Multimorbidity group of European General Practice Research Network,
   the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25) scale was identified as
   valid, reproducible, effective and easy to use. Subsequently, it has
   been translated and adapted to 13 languages, including Castilian.
   Currently, the scale is being validated in different languages. Research
   question: What are the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of
   HSCL-25 (HSCL-25e) for depression detection in Primary Care? Methods:
   HSCL-25e was administered to outpatients recruited by their physicians
   in six health centres involved in Spanish EIRA3 study, a trial to
   promote healthy behaviours in people aged from 45 to 75. Patients
   complimented HSCL-25 themselves. Sample size was calculated with R
   package (pROC). Statistical analysis: responsiveness was analysed with
   missing data and detecting ceiling and floor effects for the items.
   Principal component analysis (PCA) was done to determine the dimensions
   of HSCL-25e. Item-total correlation, Cronbach's alpha (global and
   dimensions coefficient) and squared multiple correlation were carried
   out to calculate internal consistency. Results: Seven hundred and
   sixty-nine patients out of 806 complimented HSCL-25e, 738 answered to
   all of the items. No patterns of missing answers were found. No ceiling
   effects, expected floor effect in item 18. Item 17 was the most
   consistent one and item 24 was the lower one. All items showed positive
   discrimination index for both cut-off points (1.55 and 1.75). PCA
   indicated two factors; 13 items corresponding to depression dimension
   and the other 12 items corresponding to anxiety subscale. Global
   Cronbach's alpha was 0.92 (0.88 calculated for depression dimension and
   0.84 for anxiety dimension). Conclusion: The HSCL-25e has excellent
   psychometric properties when applied to Primary Care population. It has
   two dimensions as the original version, although the items included are
   not exactly the same. There are more item coincidences with the French
   version.
   Background: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the first mortality cause
   worldwide with 17.5 million death in 2012. Spices (Scaling-up Packages
   of Interventions for CVD prevention in selected sites in Europe and
   Sub-Saharan Africa) gathered five countries around CVD primary
   prevention interventions, especially for populations with low access to
   prevention and health care system. In France, a rural area where people
   were more deprived and with a low settlement of general practitioners
   (GPs) fitted with the project. Research question: What are the barriers
   and the facilitators for cardiovascular primary prevention
   implementation from caregivers and patients' point of view of a deprived
   rural area? Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted until
   theoretical saturation of data. Purposive samplings of GPs, patients,
   patients' families, nurses and pharmacists were designed. Five interview
   guides explored cardiovascular prevention, cardiovascular health
   promotion in the setting, actors of CVD prevention, capacities for CVD
   prevention, patients' and healthcare professionals' representations,
   barriers and facilitators in implementing CVD prevention, possible
   solutions. Guides were adapted concurrently to the analysis. A blinded
   thematic analysis and a mind-mapping were achieved for each group.
   Results: Thirteen GPS, 11 pharmacists', 14 nurses, 12 patients' and 12
   patients' family members' interviews were achieved. Professionals
   highlighted a disconnection between them and national prevention
   programs, lack of time, payment and training for CVD prevention.
   Countryside was either protective or aggressive regarding CVD risk
   balancing gardening and space against isolation and lack of structures.
   GPs had poor connections with the community. Patients described their
   recklessness and feeling of invulnerability until their CVD appeared.
   Families could be a barrier to CVD prevention and lifestyle change.
   Risky behaviours were handed down from one generation to another.
   Conclusion: Innovative interventions for Spices should focus on these
   community specificities and individual behavioural strategies in
   contrast with the six national plans addressing CVD in France. These
   plans solely concentrate on dissemination of prevention messages and
   knowledge, which is of little use according to this survey.}},

Abstract = {{Compulsive smartphone use has attracted extensive social attention
   because of serious and even fatal outcomes associated with it. However,
   there has been little theory-driven research systematically
   investigating the mechanism of compulsive behavior in smartphone use.
   Although a significant line of literature exists in the area of
   personal-computer based technology addiction, the mechanism underpinning
   compulsive smartphone use differs significantly because the unique and
   specific characteristics of smartphones have given rise to a
   fundamentally different usage context with new usage behavioral
   patterns. In order to comprehensively theorize this issue, we first
   defined compulsive behavior in smartphone use, focusing on mobile social
   networking services (SNSs) in particular, and then extended the
   stimulus-response-reinforcement framework to investigate the theoretical
   network of compulsive use of mobile SNSs. We used online survey data
   from 368 active mobile SNS users in China to empirically test and
   validate the proposed model and hypotheses. Our results indicate that
   both positive and negative reinforcements, as well as the compensatory
   component, invoke the feeling of urge that leads to compulsive mobile
   SNS use. The positive effects of interactivity as an incentive stimulus
   on those reinforcements and compulsive mobile SNS use were also found to
   be significant.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES}},

Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{46-55}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Whereas adaptations to climate change in the agriculture sector are well
   studied, non-climatic drivers thereof are considerably less explored.
   This is particularly true for market related factors. Every change in
   farming practices is attributed to climate change. This article presents
   new evidence of how adaptations to market risks may be incorrectly
   attributed to climate change risk because of causal attribution bias
   emerging from poorly structured survey instrument and response inducing
   questions. Through a quasi-experiment administered on 400 rural fanning
   households from four districts of Pakistan, we demonstrate that when
   farmers are not sensitized about climate change prior to questions on
   adaptations they assign market factors such as availability of new
   market opportunities, improved purchasing power, and net profitability
   as major reason for changes in sowing date, growing new crop verity and
   use of fertilizers. To be exact, less than 2\% and 1\% of farmers
   indicated climate change as the reason behind the change in crop variety
   and use of fertilizers respectively. Similarly, only 10\% of farmers
   associated late sowing with climate change. Findings of the study imply
   a stronger role of the market-related factors in changing agricultural
   practices over the time asking policymakers to design better
   market-based interventions and incentives for increasing the adaptation
   in the agriculture community. Findings have also implications for mix
   method research and can be generalized for all research fields involving
   survey design.}},

Abstract = {{Demand response (DR) has been widely recognized as an important approach

Abstract = {{Background Although there is a great deal of literature regarding
   effective recruitment and challenges of recruiting specific patient
   populations, there is less known about best practices for recruitment of
   nurses as study subjects. Objectives The purpose of this article is to
   report our experience with recruitment and retention for a randomized
   trial of an online educational program to prepare oncology nurses to
   discuss oncology clinical trials with patients. Methods The study
   population included currently employed oncology nurses with direct
   patient interaction. There were three phases of this study: (1)
   qualitative interviews, (2) a pilot test, and (3) the randomized trial.
   Phase 3 was rolled out in five waves of recruitment. The distinct phases
   of the study-and the gradual roll out of recruitment during Phase
   3-allowed us to test and refine our recruitment and retention methods
   for the randomized trial. Upon analysis of our response rate and
   attrition after the first wave of recruitment in Phase 3, we made
   several changes to improve recruitment and retention, including adding
   incentives, shortening the survey, and increasing the number of
   reminders to complete the program. Results The response rate was higher
   when we used both e-mail and U.S. postal mail solicitations. After the
   first wave of recruitment in the final phase, changes in our strategies
   did not increase our overall response rate significantly; however, the
   rate of attrition following baseline declined. Discussion Recruitment
   planning is an important component of successful clinical research. The
   use of the Internet for both recruitment of subjects and testing of
   interventions remains a cost-effective and potentially high yield
   methodology. Our research demonstrated several successful approaches to
   yield increased participation and retention of subjects, including
   seeking formal relationships with professional organizations as sponsors
   or supporters, providing meaningful incentives to participants, keeping
   surveys or questionnaires as short as possible, and planning multiple
   follow-up contacts from the outset.}},

Journal = {{RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Owing to countless advancements in information technology, all
   residential consumers, in any part of the world, are empowered to
   contribute to demand response (DR) programs, to manage their electricity
   usage and to cut associated expenses using a suitable energy management
   system. Solutions based on consumer participation in meeting the growing
   electricity demand are carried out through different programs, and
   incentive-based demand response (IBDR) programs play an important role
   in these circumstances. However, introducing such programs to any new
   market needs consumers' willingness along with a good policy support.
   This study assesses the willingness and interest of consumers to
   participate in different IBDR programs and the associated need for
   developing policies, based on the consumers' feedback, in a subsidized
   electricity market such as that of Kuwait. A survey was conducted to get
   feedback from consumers on three different IBDR programs and four
   incentive schemes.
   After establishing the association between incentivization and load
   reduction, and identifying consumers' choice on the most preferred IBDR
   programs and incentive schemes, the results were used to assess the need
   for different policy strategies for a typical subsidized market. The
   results of this study can be taken as a reference for formulating
   policies and programs for similar markets. The analysis on the impact of
   the programs indicates that by implementing IBDR programs, in addition
   to the financial benefit to both consumers and implementer, Kuwait can
   maintain its reserve capacity without any further addition of power

Journal = {{BMC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Evaluation of health technology programmes should be
   theoretically informed, interdisciplinary, and generate in-depth
   explanations. The NASSS (non-adoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread,
   sustainability) framework was developed to study unfolding technology
   programmes in real time-and in particular to identify and manage their
   emergent uncertainties and interdependencies. In this paper, we offer a
   worked example of how NASSS can also inform ex post (i.e. retrospective)
   evaluation.
   Methods: We studied the TORPEDO (Treatment of Cardiovascular Risk in
   Primary Care using Electronic Decision Support) research programme, a
   multi-faceted computerised quality improvement intervention for
   cardiovascular disease prevention in Australian general practice. The
   technology (HealthTracker) had shown promise in a cluster randomised
   controlled trial (RCT), but its uptake and sustainability in a
   real-world implementation phase was patchy. To explain this variation,
   we used NASSS to undertake secondary analysis of the multi-modal TORPEDO
   dataset (results and process evaluation of the RCT, survey responses,
   in-depth professional interviews, videotaped consultations) as well as a
   sample of new, in-depth narrative interviews with TORPEDO researchers.
   Results: Ex post analysis revealed multiple areas of complexity whose
   influence and interdependencies helped explain the wide variation in
   uptake and sustained use of the HealthTracker technology: the nature of
   cardiovascular risk in different populations, the material properties
   and functionality of the technology, how value (financial and
   non-financial) was distributed across stakeholders in the system,
   clinicians' experiences and concerns, organisational preconditions and
   challenges, extra-organisational influences (e.g. policy incentives),
   and how interactions between all these influences unfolded over time.
   Conclusion: The NASSS framework can be applied retrospectively to
   generate a rich, contextualised narrative of technology-supported change
   efforts and the numerous interacting influences that help explain its
   successes, failures, and unexpected events. A NASSS-informed ex post
   analysis can supplement earlier, contemporaneous evaluations to uncover
   factors that were not apparent or predictable at the time but dynamic
   and emergent.}},

Abstract = {{Background The prevention of nosocomial infections requires
   participation from the patients themselves. In the past, however,
   patients have been apprehensive to point out hygiene-relevant behaviour
   to the personnel. In the project AHOI, the possibilities of active
   patient involvement in infection prevention are identified, tested and
   realized. The goal is a prevention strategy based upon three dimensions:
   ``adherence{''}, ``empowerment{''} and ``acceptance{''}. ``AHOI{''}
   stands for the ``Activation of patients, persons in need of care and
   care givers for a Hygiene-conscious participatiOn in Infection
   control{''}. Results from the AHOI pilot study on the implementation of
   a multimodal intervention bundle are reported. Methods In 2017, a
   two-stage patient survey was conducted on two surgical wards for 14
   weeks. In addition to the intervention bundle, acceptance, adherence and
   empowerment regarding individual hygiene behaviour and perception were
   evaluated. The bundle included an AHOI-welcome-box with an informational
   and entertaining brochure and supportive incentives. Furthermore,
   multiple visual materials like video presentations for patients' bedside
   TV, posters and visual reminders in the patients' bedrooms and sanitary
   facilities were installed. Results 179 respondents were surveyed at
   admission, 139 at discharge and 133 at both time points. Almost all
   respondents wanted to contribute to infection control. The AHOI project
   was well accepted by patients. Two-thirds wanted to be more involved.
   More than a third expected a negative response from staff after pointing
   out hygiene deficiencies. Four respondents observed a deficiency in
   hygiene with healthcare personnel and reported a very positive reaction
   once this was communicated to the personnel. More than four-fifths of
   the respondents felt well integrated and adequately informed post
   intervention. The feeling of active involvement correlated significantly
   with subjective participation and adherence to hygienic measures,
   especially self-reported hand disinfection. Conclusion The results
   demonstrated that the required inclusion of patients in infection
   control is possible with AHOI. Active involvement of patients and
   relatives is associated with improvements in adherence to infection
   prevention measures.}},

Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: Questionnaires are valuable data collection instruments in
   public health research, and can serve to pre-screen respondents for
   suitability in future studies. Survey non-response leads to reduced
   effective sample sizes and can decrease representativeness of the study
   population, so high response rates are needed to minimize the risk of
   bias. Here we present results on the success of different postal
   questionnaire strategies at effecting response, and the effectiveness of
   these strategies at recruiting participants for a field study on the
   effects of aircraft noise on sleep.
   Methods: In total, we mailed 17 rounds of 240 questionnaires (total n =
   4080) to randomly selected households around Atlanta International
   Airport. Different mailing rounds were varied in the length of the
   questionnaire (11, 26 or 55 questions), survey incentive (gift card or
   \$2 cash), number of follow-up waves (0, 2 or 3), incentive for
   participating in a 5-night in-home sleep study (\$100, \$150 or \$200),
   and address personalization.
   Results: We received completed questionnaires from 407 respondents
   (response rate 11.4\%). Personalizing the address, enclosing a \$2 cash
   incentive with the initial questionnaire mailing and repeated follow-up
   mailings were effective at increasing response rate. Despite the
   increased expense of these approaches in terms of each household mailed,
   the higher response rates meant that they were more cost-effective
   overall for obtaining an equivalent number of responses. Interest in
   participating in the field study decreased with age, but was unaffected
   by the mailing strategies or cash incentives for field study
   participation. The likelihood that a respondent would participate in the
   field study was unaffected by survey incentive, survey length, number of
   follow-up waves, field study incentive, age or sex.
   Conclusions: Pre-issued cash incentives and sending follow-up waves
   could maximize the representativeness and numbers of people from which
   to recruit, and may be an effective strategy for improving recruitment
   into field studies.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF RISK RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1503-1521}},

Abstract = {{Flood preparedness of private households is regarded an essential
   building block of integrated flood risk management. In the past decade,
   numerous empirical studies have employed the protection motivation
   theory (PMT) to explain flood mitigation behavior at the household
   level. However, much of this research has produced mixed results and
   could not consistently confirm the strength and direction of the
   relationships between the PMT components. Based on a survey of 2,007
   households in flood-prone areas, this study revisits the model structure
   of the PMT by means of structural equation modeling. Compared to the
   methods used in previous studies, this modeling technique allows us to
   capture the PMT components in greater detail and to comprehensively test
   their hypothesized interrelations. Our results point to two separate
   routes leading to two different response types: A protective route from
   coping appraisal to protective behavior, and a non-protective route from
   threat appraisal to non-protective responses. Risk perception is not
   found to be part of the protective route, neither are non-protective
   responses confirmed to undermine protection motivation. The two separate
   routes are observed consistently across all combinations of the six
   protective and four non-protective responses assessed in this study. In
   the light of encouraging private flood adaptation, risk communication
   measures should specifically target the protective route and avoid
   (accidentally) providing incentives that fall within the non-protective
   route. This cross-sectional study, however, cannot establish how the two
   routes interrelate over time. More experimental and longitudinal
   research is required to address potential feedback effects and the role
   of decision stages.}},

Abstract = {{This paper offers lessons learned in evaluating the reauthorization of
   the Violence Against Women Act (2013) requirement that colleges

   created {[}multi college bystander efficacy evaluation (mcBEE)]. Through
   this consortium 24 public colleges were recruited and their choices
   regarding bystander programming options were queried. Concurrently,
   rates of violence perpetration and victimization were measured over 4
   years among undergraduate students at each college. Description and
   details of experiences in recruiting colleges into a college consortium,
   addressing regulatory compliance, approaches to selecting and launching
   college-wide surveys to undergraduate students across several large
   campuses, and strategies to communicate findings and data back to each
   recruited campus are presented. Suggestions for future consortium
   building include budgeting sufficient time to recruit colleges, manage

Abstract = {{Networks of roadside ditches criss-cross the landscape, and have played
   a significant but previously unrecognized role in flooding and water
   pollution. This study surveyed town and county highway professionals
   across New York State (NYS) to determine their ditch management
   practices. There was a 41\% response rate from the 999 highway staff
   surveyed, representing 54 of the 57 counties statewide. 36.8\% of the
   agencies reported using full scraping or reshaping without reseeding as
   their primary method of ditch management and half scraped their ditches
   on average once every 1 to 4 years. It is estimated that one-third to
   one-half of the roadside ditches across upstate NYS are therefore in
   fair to poor condition. This translates to thousands of miles of exposed
   substrate vulnerable to storms, acting as a source of sediment and
   pollution. Limited resources including time, labor, equipment, and money
   were the primary reasons given for the practices used. Additional
   challenges identified included interactions with landowners over
   rights-of-way, farm-field drainage, and increasing frequency of
   downpours. A comprehensive, state-wide program will be necessary to
   actualize ditch improvement. It will require a complete toolbox of
   strategies, from financial support and training to regulatory mandates
   and penalties, and needs to include a ditch inventory system. Incentives
   in the form of grants and shared services should be offered by state
   agencies working collaboratively with local governments. Valuing highway
   department managers as water stewards and supporting the improved
   management of roadside ditches can provide an important new mechanism
   for protecting NYS's water resources.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives The primary objective was to assess the accuracy (calibration
   and validation status) of digital blood pressure (BP) monitors used
   within community pharmacy in England and the secondary objectives were
   to assess the overall quality of the BP service by assessing service
   prevalence, service utilisation and other in-service considerations.
   Design A cross-sectional survey.
   Setting Primary-care retail-pharmacies.
   Participants 500 pharmacies that contribute to government
   dispensing-data were invited by post to complete the survey. Private
   contractors were excluded.
   Interventions We conducted a questionnaire survey with a follow-up
   (September 2018 to December 2018).
   Results 109 responses were received. 61\% (n=66) of responding
   pharmacies provided a free BP check to their patients. 40 (61\%)
   pharmacies used recommended validated clinical metres, 6 (9\%) had
   failed validation and 20 (30\%) provided too little information to
   enable us to determine their monitors status.
   Conclusions Responding pharmacies were able to provide useful BP
   monitoring services to their patients, though quality enhancements need
   to be implemented. Majority of pharmacies use validated BP monitors,
   however, there was a lack of range of cuff sizes, variation in
   replacement and calibration of monitors and apparent absence of such
   practice in a minority of pharmacies alongside variation in training
   standards. We noted higher frequency of BP screening in the most
   deprived postcodes.
   We recommend in-service redesign and delivery improvements, and suggest
   professional bodies and researchers work together to create clearer
   frameworks for front-line practitioners, creating appropriate incentives
   to facilitate this service redesign.
   Funders and policy setters should consider the value added to the
   National Health Service and other healthcare agencies of such screening
   by pharmacy providers both nationally and internationally. It has the
   potential to reduce complications of undiagnosed hypertension and the
   medicines burden that it creates. Future work should examine the impact
   of pharmacist-led BP screening on patients.}},

Title = {{Fattening Pig Farmers' Intention to Participate in Animal Welfare
   Programs}},
Journal = {{ANIMALS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Simple Summary The demand for products with higher farm animal welfare
   (FAW) standards is increasing within the European Union. In response,
   representatives from agricultural associations, the slaughtering
   industry and food retailing started the industry solution Initiative
   Animal Welfare (IAW) in 2015 with the aim of establishing higher FAW
   standards on a broad basis in both poultry and pig production in
   Germany. In contrast to other available animal welfare programs (AWPs),
   the IAW receives considerable support from farmers and enjoys a large
   number of participants. This article focuses on the question why the IAW
   is gaining positive resonance among German livestock farmers. Applying
   partial least squares path modeling to analyze the determinants of
   farmers' intention to participate in the IAW, we found that the
   determinants performance expectancy, social influence, facilitating
   conditions, hedonic motivation, price value, trust and experiences with
   the IAW have a significant influence on the behavioral intention to
   participate in the IAW program. It is shown that the farmers' hedonic
   motivation has the greatest impact on participation. The prospect of
   improving the image of pig fattening and the economic incentive motivate
   many farmers to participate. Additionally, many farmers confirmed that
   they enjoy providing a more superior welfare status to their pigs. The
   social determinant was also identified as a strong influencing factor.
   The results suggest that participation in AWPs could be improved by
   appropriate remuneration and measures promoting farmers' intrinsic
   motivation to engage in AWPs.
   Abstract Farmers are considered a highly important stakeholder group for
   the successful implementation of higher farm animal welfare (FAW)
   standards, but so far little is known about their attitudes and the
   determinants of their participation in programs that request higher FAW
   standards. To close this research gap, fattening pig farmers in Germany
   were questioned via a large-scale online survey in 2018 (n = 239). Based
   on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, a partial
   least squares path modeling (PLS) was run. Results show that the
   expected performance as well as the expected costs associated with the
   Initiative Animal Welfare (IAW) substantially influence fattening pig
   farmers' behavioral intention to participate in the IAW. Furthermore,
   the decision is influenced by social determinants and facilitating
   conditions such as deadweight effects. Farmers' hedonic motivation, fair
   remuneration and previous experiences with the establishment of higher
   FAW standards can influence their intention to take part in the IAW. In
   addition, farmers' trust in the program is a major determinant. There
   are also moderating variables such as age and work experience that
   influence farmers' intention to take part in the IAW. Our results have
   important managerial implications for the IAW and can help to design
   further tailor-made animal welfare programs (AWPs) that fulfill the
   requirements of both fattening pig farmers and the broader public not
   only in Germany but the European Union.}},

Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Background The use of electronic medical record (EMR) is anticipated to
   bring benefits for patients, physicians, and organizations. But limited
   physicians' acceptance of EMR presents a serious threat to its effective
   implementation. Objectives The current study incorporates technology
   acceptance model (TAM) with two antecedents, gender, and clinical
   specialty and one context-specific factor, financial incentives, to
   identify the factors that influence physicians' intention to use EMR in
   Taiwan. Methods The survey methodology was used to collect data from the
   physicians, working in the regional hospital that had implemented EMR
   system. A total of 119 out of 213 questionnaires returned in a response
   rate of 56\%. But four responses were considered ineffective due to
   missing values. The structural equation modeling (SEM) technique was
   employed to analyze the research framework. Results The partial least
   squares (PLS) regression indicated that three factors perceived
   usefulness, financial incentives, and attitude toward using EMR
   significantly affect physicians' intention. But concerning perceived
   ease of use (PEOU), an insignificant path coefficient was reported.
   Additionally, regression analysis showed gender, and clinical specialty
   positively influenced physicians' intention to use EMR. Discussion and
   Conclusions The proposed research framework contributes to the
   conclusive explanation for interpreting physicians' intention to use
   EMR. Physicians generally have a higher level of computer literacy.
   Therefore, the factor of PEOU could not be critical regarding adopting
   new health information technology (HIT). This study also brings
   perspectives from the gender, and clinical differences have primarily
   been missing in the literature of the physicians' intention to use HIT.
   In doing so, it infers how gender, and clinical specialty, may
   complement (and in some instances, reinforce) the influence of
   technological and attitudinal factors of HIT use. Thus, health care
   providers must take these factors into consideration in the development
   and validation of the theories regarding the intention to use EMR.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Major acute care research is conducted within critical care
   research networks (CCRN). Our aims were to describe CCRN and
   participating ICUs.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among all CCRNs
   belonging to the International Forum of Acute Care Trialists. A network
   questionnaire was sent to CCRN directors and an ICU e-questionnaire was
   sent to participating ICUS.
   Results: Survey was answered by 366 ICUs from 17 CCRNs (median response
   rate 21\% {[}12-38]). CCRNs have different organizations (ownership,
   memberships, funding). The number of studies conducted, patients
   included and publications varied a lot across CCRNs. The collaboration
   with other research networks or health authorities was very frequent
   (n=13, 76\%). Most ICUs (n=315; 86\%) are located in large teaching
   hospitals in high income countries with a mean volume of 968 (842-1102
   (95\% CI)) annual admissions. The recognition at the academic level
   (n=133; 70\%), the collaboration with experts (n=284; 85\%), and
   improving practices (n=286; 86\%) are incentives reported to belong to a
   CCRN.
   Conclusions: Despite different organizations, CCRN share similar
   ventures including the value of improving quality of critical care
   delivery. Participating ICUs share several structural and managerial
   patterns. These observations enlighten the importance of CCRN to enhance
   quality of critical care delivery. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents a systematic way of understanding and modeling
   traveler behavior in response to on-demand mobility services. We
   explicitly consider the sequential and yet inter-connected
   decision-making stages specific to on-demand service usage. The
   framework includes a hybrid choice model for service subscription, and
   three logit mixture models with inter-consumer heterogeneity for the
   service access, menu product choice and opt-out choice. Different models
   are connected by feeding logsums. The proposed modeling framework is
   essential for accounting the impacts of real-time on-demand system's
   dynamics on traveler behaviors and capturing consumer heterogeneity,
   thus being greatly relevant for integrations in multi-modal dynamic
   simulators. The methodology is applied to a case study of an innovative
   personalized on-demand real-time system which incentivizes travelers to
   select more sustainable travel options. The data for model estimation is
   collected through a smartphone-based context-aware stated preference
   survey. Through model estimation, lower values of time are observed when
   the respondents opt to use the reward system. The perception of
   incentives and schedule delay by different population segments are
   quantified. These results are fundamental in setting the ground for
   different behavioral scenarios of such a new on-demand system. The
   proposed methodology is flexible to be applied to model other on-demand
   mobility services such as ride-hailing services and the emerging
   mobility as a service.}},

Abstract = {{Background Strong consensus exists on the need to expand participation
   of URM doctoral students in STEM fields, to increase their retention,
   reduce their average time to degree, and provide these students with the
   preparation necessary to compete for faculty positions. This paper
   provides a model for implementing effective strategies to support the
   success of URM STEM graduate students across a system with various types
   of institutions. An innovative professional development, participation
   incentive, and community building program for underrepresented minority
   (URM) Graduate students in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and
   mathematics) fields was instrumental in preparing them to secure
   academic positions, navigating graduate school successfully, and form a
   support network that helped them excel at the next level. The program
   provided sustained support and several activities in a collaborative
   environment for 84 Ph.D. and 84 Master's students, in over 43 graduate
   programs. Data were collected using evaluation questionnaires containing
   open-ended responses and responses to specific items sent to the
   students after each activity, and a survey seeking their feedback on the
   program. Results In only 4 years, the program helped 13 students to
   secure faculty or post-doctoral positions, and improved the opinion of
   the professoriate career as thirteen students transitioned to the Ph.D.
   program and are now more interested in applying for faculty positions.
   The program was successful in developing and sustaining large-scale,
   distributed, yet interconnected STEM communities among the diverse
   Alliance system institutions and increased participation (from 58 in
   2013 to 98 in 2017), reduced barriers, and promoted the success of URM
   doctoral students preparing for careers in the professoriate.
   Conclusions We have developed activities that connected students and
   faculty across institutions, providing multiple paths to the
   professoriate that align with students' diverse academic career
   aspirations. This article illustrates that professional development,
   incentives, and community building interventions are essential in
   generating URM STEM education transformation.}},

Abstract = {{Many colleges and universities conduct web-based campus climate surveys
   to understand the prevalence and nature of sexual assault among their
   students. When designing and fielding a web survey to measure a
   sensitive topic like sexual assault, methodological decisions, including
   the length of the field period and the use or amount of an incentive,
   can affect the representativeness of the respondent sample leading to
   biased or imprecise estimates. This study uses data from the Campus
   Climate Survey Validation Study (CCSVS) to assess how the interaction
   between field period length and survey incentive amount affects
   nonresponse, sample representativeness, and the precision of survey
   estimates. Research suggests that using robust incentives gives
   potential survey respondents a reason to complete the survey beyond
   their intrinsic motivation to do so. Likewise, extending the field
   period gives more time to people who may be less intrinsically motivated
   to complete the survey. Both serve to increase sample size and
   representativeness, minimize bias, and improve estimate precision.
   Schools, however, sometimes lack the time and/or resources for both a
   robust incentive and a lengthy field period, and this study examines the
   extent to which the potential negative impacts of not using one can be
   mitigated by the presence of the other. Findings indicate that target
   response rates can be achieved using a smaller incentive if the field
   period is lengthy but, even with a lengthy field period, the use of a
   smaller incentive can result in biased estimates due to a lack of
   representativeness. Conversely, when a robust incentive is used and
   weights are developed to adjust for nonresponse, a shorter field period
   will not have a significant impact on point estimates, but the estimates
   will be less precise due to fewer respondents participating in the
   survey.}},

   ACO, including generalist physicians (18\%), internal medicine
   specialists (16\%), surgeons (10\%), other physician specialists (27\%),
   and advanced practice providers (29\%). Response rate was 34\%. Main
   Measures Primary exposures included clinicians' participation in ACO
   decision-making, awareness of ACO incentives, perceived influence on
   practice, and perceived quality improvement. Our primary outcome was
   clinicians' reported difficulty implementing recommendations against

   join the ACO (3\%). Few clinicians were aware of ACO incentives,
   including knowing the ACO was accountable for both spending and quality
   (23\%), successfully lowered spending (9\%), or faced upside risk only
   (3\%). Few agreed (moderately or strongly) the ACO changed compensation
   (20\%), practice (19\%), or feedback (15\%) or that it improved care
   coordination (17\%) or inappropriate care (13\%). Clinicians reported
   they had difficulty following recommendations against low-value care
   18\% of the time; clinicians reported patients had difficulty accepting
   recommendations 36\% of the time. Increased ACO awareness (1 standard

   Clinicians participating in a large Medicare ACO were broadly unaware of
   and unengaged with ACO objectives and activities. Whether low clinician
   engagement limits ACO efforts to reduce low-value care warrants further
   longitudinal study.}},

Abstract = {{This study uses an online survey experiment to test whether the pairing
   of profit-seeking with mission-related programs in the social sector
   attracts or deters donations from individual donors. We test
   individuals' response to three types of profit incentives allowed under
   current U.S. public policy: (1) non-distributed profit to an
   organization, which is allowed for nonprofit entities; (2) profit to the
   organization's equity investors and owners, which is allowed under
   for-profit social enterprise governance charters; and (3) profit to
   lending investors, which is introduced by social impact bonds, a
   pay-for-success policy tool. We test trust theory, under which profit
   incentives deter donors against entrepreneurial orientation (EO) theory,
   which suggests that donors are attracted to organizations that use
   innovative, market-driven programs. Findings indicate support for both
   theories, but the support depends on how the specific profit incentive
   is structured. Donors support organizations that use profit-generating
   social enterprise programs-but only when the profits are
   non-distributable; donors' support is significantly lower for social
   enterprises in which owners and equity investors may profit. Importantly
   however, this negative effect is not found for pay-for-success policy
   tools where lending investors, rather than equity investors and owners,
   receive profits.}},

Abstract = {{Economists and philosophers disagree about the concept of choice used in
   economics. Some behavioural economists argue that economic models of
   choice will improve as they become more and more psychologically
   realistic. Don Ross argues that this argument fails because its hidden
   assumption - that the economic concept of choice is the same as the
   psychological counterpart - is false. Ross conjectures that the economic
   concept of choice concerns a population-scale pattern of behavioural
   changes in response to incentives. We conduct a survey experiment to
   test two predictions that Ross's conjecture generates. The statistical
   analysis of our data confirms our predictions, although with some
   qualifications. In interpreting our results, we distinguish two versions
   of commonsensible realism, strong and weak, and propose the weak one as
   a plausible explanation of our results. Weak commonsensible realism also
   produces further testable hypotheses. Some methodological implications

Title = {{Contemporary Views of Research Participant Willingness to Participate
   and Share Digital Data in Biomedical Research}},
Journal = {{JAMA NETWORK OPEN}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE Using social media to recruit participants is a common and
   cost-effective practice. Willingness to participate (WTP) in biomedical
   research is a function of trust in the scientific team, which is closely
   tied to the source of funding and institutional connections.
   OBJECTIVE To determine whether WTP and willingness to share social media
   data are associated with the type of research team and online
   recruitment platform.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This mixed-methods longitudinal survey
   and qualitative study was conducted over 2 points (T1 and T2) using
   Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform. Participants were US adults
   aged 18 years or older who use at least 1 social media platform.
   Recruitment was stratified to match race/ethnicity proportions of the
   2010 US Census. The volunteer sample consisted of 914 participants at
   T1, and 655 participants completed the follow-up survey 5 months later
   (T2).
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Outcomes were (1) past experience with online
   research and sharing social media data for research; (2) WTP in research
   advertised online; (3) WTP in a study sponsored by a pharmaceutical
   company, a university, or a federal agency; and (4) willingness to share
   social media data. Opinions were solicited regarding the European
   Union's General Data Protection Regulation statute, which came into
   effect between T1 and T2.
   RESULTS Of 914 participants completing the first survey (T1), 604
   (66.1\%) were aged 18 to 39 years and 494 (54.0\%) were female. Of
   these, 655 participants (71.7\%) responded at T2. While 680 participants
   (74.4\%) indicated WTP in biomedical research, only 454 (49.3\%) were
   willing to share their social media data. Participants were
   significantly less likely to participate in federally sponsored (odds
   ratio {[}OR], 0.58; 95\% CI, 0.51-0.64; P <.001) or pharmaceutical
   company (OR, 0.59; 95\% CI, 0.53-0.66; P <.001) research than
   university-led studies. They were also less likely to share their social
   medial data for federal (OR, 0.65; 95\% CI, 0.58-0.72; P <.001) or
   pharmaceutical company (OR, 0.50; 95\% CI, 0.44-0.56; P <.001) research
   compared with academic studies. Willingness to participate in
   pharmaceutical company-led research decreased 11.89\% from T1 to T2 (OR
   for T2, 0.62; 95\% CI, 0.54-0.77; P <.001). Reasons for WTP were
   interest in furthering science, financial incentives, trust in the
   organization, and data security. While 63.0\% of respondents reported
   seeing new privacy policy emails related to the General Data Protection
   Regulation law, only 27.1\% indicated this positively influenced their
   WTP. Thematic analysis of responses indicated that WTP may improve with
   stronger data security measures.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study suggests that researchers may see
   reduced online research participation and data sharing, particularly for
   research conducted outside academia.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the incidence on household consumption of the introduction of
   tax incentives to retirement saving. First, using data from a panel of
   tax returns we document that most contributions to pension funds are by
   older/high-income individuals. Then we use panel data from a consumption
   survey spanning the period 1985 and 1991 to find that there is
   substantial heterogeneity in the response of household saving to tax
   incentives. While the overall amount of new saving we estimate is
   limited (at most 19 cents per euro contributed on average), saving
   responses differ substantially across age groups: among the group of
   households between 56 and 65 years of age, the group that most actively
   contributed to the plan, there are very small consumption changes; among
   the group of households between 46 and 55 years of age, the decrease in
   (mostly durable) consumption expenditures is much larger.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a preliminary list of drivers, barriers, and enablers to
   end-of-life management of photovoltaic panels and battery energy storage
   systems obtained from a systematic literature review was firstly
   evaluated and then expanded through an iterative expert review process.
   Subsequently, a questionnaire survey was administered in Australia to
   elicit stakeholder perceptions on each driver, barrier, and enabler
   factor. A total of 57 complete responses was obtained. A two-step
   cluster analysis was performed to compare the perceived drivers,
   barriers, and enablers between four stakeholder categories including
   research/education institutions, product stewardship arrangement (PSA)
   parties, governments, and consultants. Findings indicated that there is
   a high degree of agreement among stakeholders on various drivers,
   barriers, and enablers; however, some factors exhibited differences. It
   appeared that all stakeholders were driven to address triple bottom line
   issues, however, research/education institutions put more emphasis on
   the economic and environmental drivers. Stakeholders reported the lack
   of profitability, unavailability of regulations and incentives, as well
   as a lack of awareness of safe disposal options, as being the most
   significant barriers. Only government respondents recognised the current
   lack of on-shore recycling infrastructures as a critical barrier.
   Introducing a product stewardship scheme, implementing business models
   for collection, economic incentives, as well as developing recycling
   technologies and infrastructures were regarded as the most important
   enablers. Policy and practice implications and recommendations were also
   discussed in this study.}},

Abstract = {{Incentive programs to encourage landowners to protect habitat should be
   carefully designed to avoid motivation crowding: basically, replacing
   intrinsic reasons such as a land ethic with extrinsic ones like
   payments. Little research on motivation crowding tests real programs,
   and no such work has been done in Canada. We surveyed farmers in Nova
   Scotia in 2017 to explore whether participation in a new incentive
   program called Wood Turtle Strides, or knowledge about a similar
   incentive program potentially available in the future, would alter
   reported motivations to use riparian setbacks and buffers. Motivations
   to use setbacks or buffers were heavily intrinsic across all four survey
   cohorts: wildlife stewardship and sacrifice motivated actions more than
   social pressures. We were not able to statistically test for
   motivational crowding due to low program uptake and thus post-program
   survey responses, but there was no evidence of second-hand crowding:
   farmers being motivated by hearing about a program in an adjacent
   jurisdiction. Findings point to the significance of wildlife stewardship
   for many farmers, and persistent resistance to conservation among
   others, as well as a risk of low additionality. More post-program
   research is necessary to fully understand the program's net impact on

Abstract = {{Background: The association between health literacy and health care
   costs, particularly for hospitalizations and emergency room services,
   has been previously observed. Health information interventions aimed at
   addressing the negative impacts of inadequate health literacy are
   needed. The MedEncentive Mutual Accountability and Information Therapy
   (MAIT) Program is a Web-based system designed to improve health and
   lower costs by aligning patient-doctor incentives.
   Objective: In this mixed methods study of a Web-based patient-doctor
   aligned-incentive, information therapy program conducted in an
   1800-member employee health plan, we aimed to (1) determine the
   program's quantitative impact on hospitalization and emergency room
   utilization and costs, and (2) assess survey responses about the
   program's perceived value.
   Methods: We used a mixed methods, single within-group, pre-post,
   descriptive study design. We analyzed quantitative data using pre-post
   mean utilization and cost differences and summarized the data using
   descriptive statistics. We used open-ended electronic survey items to
   collect descriptive data and analyzed them using thematic content
   analysis.
   Results: Hospitalizations and emergency room visits per 1000 decreased
   32\% (26.5/82.4) and 14\% (31.3/219.9), respectively, after we
   implemented the program in 2015-2017, relative to 2013-2014.
   Correspondingly, the plan's annual per capita expenditures declined US
   \$675 (95\% CI US \$470-865), or 10.8\% (\$675/\$6260), after program
   implementation in 2015-2017 (US \$5585 in 2013-2014 dollars), relative
   to the baseline years of 2013-2014 (US \$6260; P<.05). Qualitative
   findings suggested that respondents valued the program, benefiting from
   its educational and motivational aspects to better self-manage their
   health.
   Conclusions: Analyses suggested that the reported reductions in
   hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and costs were associated with
   the program. Qualitative findings indicated that targeted users
   perceived value in participating in the MAIT Program. Further research
   with controls is needed to confirm these outcomes and more completely
   understand the health improvement and cost-containment capabilities of
   this Web-based health information, patient-doctor, aligned-incentive

Abstract = {{Maintaining high response rates over time is critical for the integrity
   of longitudinal studies. A best practice for encouraging survey
   participation in cross-sectional studies is to send sample members a
   pre-incentive with the survey invitation. However, in longitudinal
   studies this may change sample members' future expectations of
   incentives. Instead researchers can use a prenotice to remind
   longitudinal sample members of the study and inform them of the upcoming
   wave. A unique greeting card format for a prenotice was experimentally
   tested against a \$10 pre-incentive in the longitudinal study Add
   Health. The prenotice card, which thanked sample members for their
   ongoing contributions to the study over the last 20-plus years,
   significantly increased response rates and decreased survey response
   times over the 12-month course of data collection compared to the
   control. At the end of data collection, the prenotice card was equally
   effective as a \$10 pre-incentive. However, in the first month of data
   collection, the combination of the prenotice card and pre-incentive was
   the most effective approach, suggesting that the best approach may
   depend on the planned duration of data collection. Additionally, sample
   members who did not participate in a previous wave had higher response
   rates this wave with the pre-incentive compared to the control. The
   findings suggest that long-term longitudinal study participants may
   evaluate researchers' gratitude as a type of benefit on par with
   monetary incentives, offering researchers opportunities to reduce
   incentive costs, but this may differ based on previous wave
   participation.}},

Abstract = {{Background The global proliferation of mobile phones offers opportunity
   for improved non-communicable disease (NCD) data collection by
   interviewing participants using interactive voice response (IVR)
   surveys. We assessed whether airtime incentives can improve cooperation
   and response rates for an NCD IVR survey in Bangladesh and Uganda.
   Methods Participants were randomised to three arms: a) no incentive, b)
   1X incentive or c) 2X incentive, where X was set to airtime of 50
   Bangladesh Taka (US\$0.60) and 5000 Ugandan Shillings (UGX; US\$1.35).
   Adults aged 18 years and older who had a working mobile phone were
   sampled using random digit dialling. The primary outcomes, cooperation
   and response rates as defined by the American Association of Public
   Opinion Research, were analysed using log-binomial regression model.
   Results Between 14 June and 14 July 2017, 440 262 phone calls were made
   in Bangladesh. The cooperation and response rates were, respectively,
   28.8\% (353/1227) and 19.2\% (580/3016) in control, 39.2\% (370/945) and
   23.9\% (507/2120) in 50 Taka and 40.0\% (362/906) and 24.8\% (532/2148)
   in 100 Taka incentive groups. Cooperation and response rates,
   respectively, were significantly higher in both the 50 Taka (risk ratio
   (RR) 1.36, 95\% CI 1.21 to 1.53) and (RR 1.24, 95\% CI 1.12 to 1.38),
   and 100 Taka groups (RR 1.39, 95\% CI 1.23 to 1.56) and (RR 1.29, 95\%
   CI 1.16 to 1.43), as compared with the controls. In Uganda, 174 157
   phone calls were made from 26 March to 22 April 2017. The cooperation
   and response rates were, respectively, 44.7\% (377/844) and 35.2\%
   (552/1570) in control, 57.6\% (404/701) and 39.3\% (508/1293) in 5000
   UGX and 58.8\% (421/716) and 40.3\% (535/1328) in 10 000 UGX groups.
   Cooperation and response rates were significantly higher, respectively
   in the 5000 UGX (RR 1.29, 95\% CI 1.17 to 1.42) and (RR 1.12, 95\% CI
   1.02 to 1.23), and 10 000 UGX groups (RR 1.32, 95\% CI 1.19 to 1.45) and
   (RR 1.15, 95\% 1.04 to 1.26), as compared with the control group.
   Conclusion In two diverse settings, the provision of an airtime
   incentive significantly improved both the cooperation and response rates
   of an IVR survey, with no significant difference between the two
   incentive amounts.}},

Abstract = {{Background There is inequity and maldistribution of the surgical
   workforce in Nigeria. Most specialists practice in second- and
   third-level hospitals often located in urban or semi-urban areas. A
   knowledge of the proposed choice of practice location of surgical
   trainees and the factors that influence the choice could provide insight
   into future surgical coverage and help in planning and policy-making.
   Methods This is a cross-sectional survey of surgical trainees attending
   the mandatory integrated revision and update course of the West African
   College of Surgeons. Anonymous structured questionnaires were
   self-administered to 200 trainees, of which 143 completed the
   questionnaires. Results The response rate was 71.5\%. One hundred and
   six (74.1\%) trainees preferred to work in a tertiary hospital on
   completion of training, 13 (9.1\%) were in a Private Hospital, and 16
   (11.2\%) were undecided. Nearly all tertiary hospitals are in urban or
   semi-urban towns. The commonest factors influencing choice of practice
   location were proximity to family 19 (13.3\%), proximity to hometown 11
   (7.6\%), availability of working facilities 10 (6.9\%), income 7 (4.9\%)
   and underserved areas 7 (4.9\%). Of 122 (85.3\%) trainees who agreed to
   work for some period each year (ranging from 1 week to 6 months) in a
   rural setting, 42 (29.3\%) would do it without additional financial
   incentive. Conclusion The choice of most surgical trainees not to work
   in a rural setting as specialists would exacerbate the ongoing surgical
   workforce maldistribution and inequity in Nigeria. However, the
   willingness of 85.3\% to provide periodic rural surgical coverage could
   be leveraged in planning of initiatives to address the maldistribution.}},

Abstract = {{Background: There is a need to deliver smoking cessation support at a
   population level, both in developed and developing countries. Studies on
   internet-based and mobile phone based smoking cessation interventions
   have shown that these methods can be as effective as other methods of
   support, and they can have a wider reach at a lower cost.
   Objective: This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to compare, on a
   population level, the efficacy of an identical, tailored smoking
   cessation intervention delivered by mobile text messaging versus email.
   Methods: We conducted a nationwide 2-arm, double-blinded, fully
   automated RCT, close to a real-world setting, in Norway. We did not
   offer incentives to increase participation and adherence or to decrease
   loss to follow-up. We recruited users of the website, slutta.no, an
   open, free, multi-component Norwegian internet-based smoking cessation
   program, from May 2010 until October 2012. Enrolled smokers were
   considered as having completed a time point regardless of their response
   status if it was 1, 3, 6, or 12 months post cessation. We assessed 7315
   participants using the following inclusion criteria: knowledge of the
   Norwegian language, age 16 years or older, ownership of a Norwegian cell
   phone, having an email account, current cigarette smoker, willingness to
   set a cessation date within 14 days (mandatory), and completion of a
   baseline questionnaire for tailoring algorithms. Altogether, 6137
   participants were eligible for the study and 4378 participants (71.33\%)
   provided informed consent to participate in the smoking cessation trial.
   We calculated the response rates for participants at the completed 1, 3,
   6, and 12 months post cessation. For each arm, we conducted an
   intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis for each completed time point. The
   main outcome was 7-day self-reported point prevalence abstinence (PPA)
   at the completed 6 months post cessation. We calculated effect size of
   the 7-day self-reported PPA in the text message arm compared with the
   email arm as odds ratios (ORs) with 95\% CIs for the 4 time points post
   cessation.
   Results: At 6 months follow-up, 21.06\% (384/1823) of participants in
   the text message arm and 18.62\% (333/1788) in the email arm responded
   (P=.07) to the surveys. In the ITT analysis, 11.46\% (209/1823) of
   participants in the text message arm compared with 10.96\% (196/1788) in
   the email arm (OR 1.05, 95\% CI 0.86-1.30) reported to have achieved 7
   days PPA.
   Conclusions: This nationwide, double-blinded, large, fully automated RCT
   found that 1 in 9 enrolled smokers reported 7-day PPA in both arms, 6
   months post cessation. Our study found that identical smoking cessation
   interventions delivered by mobile text messaging and email may be
   equally successful at a population level.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To understand factors influencing the choice and ranking of
   Interventional Radiology (IR) training programs among a cohort of
   medical students and diagnostic radiology residents pursuing careers in
   IR.
   Materials and methods: An IRB approved, 34 question online survey
   (surveymonkey.com ) evaluated the impact of twenty-two different factors
   and demographics on IR training program selection for medical students
   and residents. The factors analyzed included programmatic features,
   location characteristics, academic reputation, program size,
   benefits/financial incentives, emphasis on clinical care, and future job
   opportunities. Comparison of Likert scale responses between medical
   students and residents were performed by using unpaired two-sample
   t-tests.
   Results: 181 (145 male, 35 female) individuals responded to the survey,
   74 medical students (40.9\%) and 107 residents (59.1\%). Medical
   students and residents both selected variety of IR cases as the most
   important and highest rated factor when choosing an IR program. Medical
   students ranked availability of a mentor (p = .03), inpatient
   consultation service (p = .003), outpatient clinic experience (p =
   .003), and ICU rotation experience (p < .001) significantly higher.
   Residents rated job placement/accomplishments of prior fellows (p = .03)
   and opinion of spouse/significant others (p = .002) significantly higher
   than medical students.
   Conclusions: The top rated factors are similar among medical students
   and residents however medical students value the clinical aspects of the
   program (ICU experience, inpatient consultation service, outpatient
   clinic) more than residents. Residents placed more value on job
   placement opportunities in selecting an IR program.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the charitable giving behavior of warm-glow givers in

   (N=1655) using the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform. First, we elicit and

   which each warm-glow donor (N=881) is randomly assigned to one of two
   treatment groups that differ for the subsidy (rebate or matching) and is
   asked to make a series of allocation decisions between himself and a
   charity of his choice. The results show that contributions are
   significantly more responsive to matching (-1.15) than to rebate
   subsidies (-0.17). Moreover, we provide evidence that, under rebate,
   price elasticity decreases as the warm-glow magnitude increases. For
   weak warm-glow givers, price elasticity is double that for strong
   warm-glow donors. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Predatory Journals: Survey Study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Predatory journals fail to fulfill the tenets of biomedical
   publication: peer review, circulation, and access in perpetuity. Despite
   increasing attention in the lay and scientific press, no studies have
   directly assessed the perceptions of the authors or editors involved.
   Objective: Our objective was to understand the motivation of authors in
   sending their work to potentially predatory journals. Moreover, we aimed
   to understand the perspective of journal editors at journals cited as
   potentially predatory.
   Methods: Potential online predatory journals were randomly selected
   among 350 publishers and their 2204 biomedical journals. Author and
   editor email information was valid for 2227 total potential
   participants. A survey for authors and editors was created in an
   iterative fashion and distributed. Surveys assessed attitudes and
   knowledge about predatory publishing. Narrative comments were invited.
   Results: A total of 249 complete survey responses were analyzed. A total
   of 40\% of editors (17/43) surveyed were not aware that they were listed
   as an editor for the particular journal in question. A total of 21.8\%
   of authors (45/206) confirmed a lack of peer review. Whereas 77\%
   (33/43) of all surveyed editors were at least somewhat familiar with
   predatory journals, only 33.0\% of authors (68/206) were somewhat
   familiar with them (P<.001). Only 26.2\% of authors (54/206) were aware
   of Beall's list of predatory journals versus 49\% (21/43) of editors
   (P<.001). A total of 30.1\% of authors (62/206) believed their
   publication was published in a predatory journal. After defining
   predatory publishing, 87.9\% of authors (181/206) surveyed would not
   publish in the same journal in the future.
   Conclusions: Authors publishing in suspected predatory journals are
   alarmingly uninformed in terms of predatory journal quality and
   practices. Editors' increased familiarity with predatory publishing did
   little to prevent their unwitting listing as editors. Some suspected
   predatory journals did provide services akin to open access publication.
   Education, research mentorship, and a realignment of research incentives
   may decrease the impact of predatory publishing.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{There is growing interest in developing effective interventions to
   manage socially and environmentally damaging conservation conflicts.
   There are a variety of intervention strategies that can be applied in
   various contexts, but the reasons one type of intervention is chosen
   over another remain underexplored. We surveyed conservation researchers
   and practitioners (n = 427) to explore how characteristics of conflicts
   and characteristics of decision makers influence recommendations to
   alleviate conservation conflict. Using a full-factorial design, we
   experimentally manipulated 3 aspects of the descriptions of 8 different
   wildlife-conflict scenarios (development status of the conflict country,
   conflict framing, and legality of killing wild animals) and recorded
   which of 5 intervention types (wildlife impact reduction, awareness,
   enforcement, economic incentives, or stakeholder engagement) respondents
   prioritized. We also recorded information on respondents' demographic
   and disciplinary backgrounds. Stakeholder-based interventions were
   recommended most often in the survey and in written feedback. However,
   when we fitted multinomial mixed logit models with fully completed
   scenario responses (n = 411), recommendations were influenced by small
   changes in the details of conflict and differed according to respondent
   characteristics. Enforcement and awareness interventions were
   prioritized relatively more for conflicts in more highly developed
   nations and by respondents with more natural science backgrounds and
   relatively less experience with conflict. Contrastingly, economic
   interventions were prioritized more when wildlife killing was described
   as illegal. Age, gender, and development status of the respondent's home
   country also predicted some intervention decisions. Further,
   interrogating the influences shaping conservation decision making will
   further helps in the development of evidence-informed interventions.}},

Title = {{Do you recommend cancer screening to your patients? A cross-sectional
   study of Norwegian doctors}},
Journal = {{BMJ OPEN}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objective Guidelines for cancer screening have been debated and are
   followed to varying degrees. We wanted to study whether and why doctors
   recommend disease-specific cancer screening to their patients.
   Design Our cross-sectional survey used a postal questionnaire. The data
   were examined with descriptive methods and binary logistic regression.
   Setting We surveyed doctors working in all health services.
   Participants Our participants comprised a representative sample of
   Norwegian doctors in 2014/2015.
   Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary outcome is whether
   doctors reported recommending their patients get screening for cancers
   of the breast, colorectum, lung, prostate, cervix and ovaries. We
   examined doctors' characteristics predicting adherence to the
   guidelines, including gender, age, and work in specialist or general
   practice. The secondary outcomes are reasons given for recommending or
   not recommending screening for breast and prostate cancer.
   Results Our response rate was 75\% (1158 of 1545). 94\% recommended
   screening for cervical cancer, 89\% for breast cancer (both established
   as national programmes), 42\% for colorectal cancer (upcoming national
   programme), 41\% for prostate cancer, 21\% for ovarian cancer and 17\%
   for lung cancer (not recommended by health authorities). General
   practitioners (GPs) adhered to guidelines more than other doctors. Early
   detection was the most frequent reason for recommending screening; false
   positives and needless intervention were the most frequent reasons for
   not recommending it.
   Conclusions A large majority of doctors claimed that they recommended
   cancer screening in accordance with national guidelines. Among doctors
   recommending screening contrary to the guidelines, GPs did so to a
   lesser degree than other specialties. Different expectations of doctors'
   roles could be a possible explanation for the variations in practice and
   justifications. The effectiveness of governing instruments, such as
   guidelines, incentives or reporting measures, can depend on which
   professional role(s) a doctor is loyal to, and policymakers should be
   aware of these different roles in clinical governance.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives To evaluate a county-wide deincentivisation of the Quality
   and Outcomes Framework (QOF) payment scheme for UK General Practice
   (GP).
   Setting In 2014, National Health Service England signalled a move
   towards devolution of QOF to Clinical Commissioning Groups. Fifty-five
   GPs in Somerset established the Somerset Practice Quality Scheme
   (SPQS)-a deincentivisation of QOF-with the goal of redirecting resources
   towards Person Centred Coordinated Care (P3C), especially for those with
   long-term conditions (LTCs). We evaluated the impact on processes and
   outcomes of care from April 2016 to March 2017.
   Participants and design The evaluation used data from 55 SPQS practices
   and 17 regional control practices for three survey instruments. We
   collected patient experiences ('P3C-EQ'; 2363 returns from patients with
   1+LTC; 36\% response rate), staff experiences ('P3C-practitioner'; 127
   professionals) and organisational data ('P3C-OCT'; 36 of 55 practices at
   two time points, 65\% response rate; 17 control practices). Hospital
   Episode Statistics emergency admission data were analysed for 2014-2017
   for ambulatory-sensitive conditions across Somerset using interrupted
   time series.
   Results Patient and practitioner experiences were similar in SPQS versus
   control practices. However, discretion from QOF incentives resulted in
   time savings in the majority of practices, and SPQS practice data showed
   a significant increase in P3C oriented organisational processes, with a
   moderate effect size (Wilcoxon signed rank test; p=0.01; r=0.42).
   Analysis of transformation plans and organisational data suggested
   stronger federation-level agreements and informal networks, increased
   multidisciplinary working, reallocation of resources for other
   healthcare professionals and changes to the structure and timings of GP
   appointments. No disbenefits were detected in admission data.
   Conclusion The SPQS scheme leveraged time savings and reduced
   administrative burden via discretionary removal of QOF incentives,
   enabling practices to engage actively in a number of schemes aimed at
   improving care for people with LTCs. We found no differences in the
   experiences of patients or healthcare professionals between SPQS and
   control practices.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Geography is fostering a diverse range of methodologies that engage the
   more-than-human dimensions of research. Debates surround the efficacy of
   both longstanding and emergent methodological approaches in grappling
   with how to do more-than-human geography. Much attention has been given
   to the methodological implications of theoretical debates that evoke
   distributed agency and calls to ``enliven{''} research. To date,
   however, questionnaire surveys have not been considered as part of these
   deliberations. Survey response rates are normally reported as
   percentages, with scholarly attention focusing on how question design,
   financial incentives, and delivery format may influence human engagement
   with the questionnaire. Little attention has been paid to questionnaire
   survey methods in or for more-than-human research. Inversely, there is
   also little discussion of the agency of non-human bodies, processes, and
   materials, and how they work for or against survey completion. This
   paper contributes to these deliberations by exploring more-than-human
   agency in the delivery and completion of a postal questionnaire,
   distributed to rural households that are self-sufficient for water on
   the south coast of New South Wales, Australia. By focusing on the
   elements, infrastructure, and animals that work with and against survey
   delivery and completion, we show that questionnaire surveys are a
   more-than-human achievement. Consideration of the chewed and weathered
   survey, and the more-than-human processes that influence its delivery
   and completion, matters in challenging ``human-centred{''} notions of
   field research. We argue that what we know about the world through a
   survey is always a performative process, not only by considering how
   research design aligns with politics and knowledge practices, but also
   the more-than-human.}},

   furniture manufacturers were more responsive towards the adoption of
   automated technologies than other types of furniture manufacturers. The
   machining centers and finishing operations within the furniture
   factories showed the highest application of automated technologies. The
   factor analysis revealed that the drivers for the application of
   automated technologies were the desire for higher production capacity,
   cost involved, product characteristics, and government policy. This
   study emphasized that in the cost-sensitive furniture manufacturing
   industry, the economic benefits of applying automation outweigh any
   other factor in the decision to explore such technologies. The study
   also revealed that furniture manufacturers are not ready to adopt
   Industry 4.0, and any efforts by the government to push for such

Title = {{Fostering Model Citizenship: Behavioral Responses to China's Emerging
   Social Credit Systems}},

Abstract = {{A variety of social credit systems (SCSs) are being implemented in China
   in order to steer the behavior of Chinese individuals, businesses,
   social organizations, and government agencies. The government and
   industry architects of these SCSs claim that such systems will
   eventually lead to more honest and law-abiding behavior, thus improving
   the quality of life among China's citizenry. However, very little is
   known about citizens' experience with and responses to different types
   of SCS initiatives. This article helps to address this gap. On the basis
   of a cross-regional survey and interviews with SCS participants, we find
   that a surprisingly high share of respondents changed their behavior at
   least once, with changes concentrated in a few categories, including
   changing shopping behavior and following traffic regulations. Citizens
   who were part of a mandatory government-run SCS pilot report altered
   their behavior in more ways than citizens who joined a commercial SCS.
   Interestingly, behavioral responses are driven mainly by material or
   symbolic (i.e., social recognition) motivations to influence scores in a
   positive way, with punitive elements playing less of a role. Finally, we
   find that SCSs currently reach only specific citizen groups due to
   variable responsiveness to the incentives provided by commercial and
   government-run SCSs.}},

Title = {{Are independent agricultural advisors more oriented towards recommending
   reduced pesticide use than supplier-affiliated advisors?<bold> </bold>}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{242}},
Pages = {{507-514}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper explores whether agricultural advisors employed by chemical
   companies or agricultural companies selling pesticides
   (supplier-affiliated advisors) are more likely to recommend more
   intensive use of pesticides than advisors employed by companies without
   an economic interest in selling pesticides (independent advisors). We
   further test whether potential differences in advice are caused by
   differences in advisors' perceived demands for advice from farmers,
   different environmental risk perceptions about pesticide use or
   different weighing of the purposes of pesticide use. The analysis is
   based on a survey administered to the whole population of 540 advisors
   in Denmark; we received 227 valid responses. The main finding is that
   pesticide advice differs across company type. We find that
   supplier-affiliated advisors are less likely to recommend lower doses -
   scoring on average 3.9 on a scale from 1 (never) to 5 (always).
   Independent advisors employed at Danish Agricultural Advisory Services
   score an average of 4.3. The difference is statistically significant.
   The analysis does not offer strong support for the different causal
   mediators we examined. Advisors across company type tend to weigh
   different objectives equally; tend to agree on environmental risk
   perception of using pesticides; and differ only slightly on perceived
   farmer demand. One possible conclusion, therefore, is that explanation
   is as simply that differences in economic incentives produce different
   recommendations between advisory companies. Policy implications of the
   findings are that the European Union should consider addressing this
   difference more directly when regulating the use of pesticides in
   European agriculture through e.g. the Sustainable Use of Pesticides
   Directive (Directive, 2009/128/EC). More differentiation in the
   approaches for informing different types of advisors might be needed.
   Moreover, our results point towards the need for knowledge about whether
   advisors in other countries than Denmark tend to believe that approved
   pesticides are innocuous to the environment because such perceptions
   might hamper initiatives to reduce the doses of approved pesticides.}},

Title = {{Means of increasing response rates in a Norwegian dietary survey among
   infants - results from a pseudo-randomized pilot study}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{19}},
Month = {{JUL 9}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundPostal surveys are widely used in scientific studies,
   including dietary surveys, but few studies about methods to increase
   participation in national dietary surveys are published. In the present
   study we compared response rates in a pilot study to a national dietary
   survey among infants using two different incentives (gift certificate or
   lottery), personalization in the form of handwritten name and address
   vs. a printed label and mode of sending out invitations (e-mail or
   postal invitation).MethodsIn this parallel-design pseudo-randomized
   pilot trial, a nationally representative sample of 698 mothers of
   infants aged 6 and 12months was drawn from the Norwegian National
   Registry and invited to complete a food frequency questionnaire about
   their infant's diet. One half of the mothers of 6month olds were
   randomized by alternation to the lottery group (n=198) and offered to
   participate in a lottery of two prizes (500 EUR and 1000 EUR). The other
   half (n=200) was offered a gift certificate (50 EUR) upon completion of
   the questionnaire. Each incentive group was randomized by alternation to
   receiving an invitation with handwritten name and address or a printed
   label. For the mothers of infants aged 12months (n=300), 150 mothers
   received an e-mail invitation and 150 mothers received a postal
   invitation. Logistic regression was used for testing differences between
   the groups.ResultsThe response rate was significantly higher (p=0.028)
   in the gift certificate group (72\%) than in the lottery group (62\%).
   No difference was seen between those receiving an invitation with a
   handwritten name and address (68\%) compared to a printed label (66\%,
   p=0.72). A somewhat higher response rate was seen when using the postal
   (50\%) compared to the e-mail invitation (43\%, p=0.25).ConclusionsIn
   this pseudo-randomized parallel-design trial of women participating in a
   national dietary survey among infants, the response rate was higher when
   offered a gift certificate than when participating in a lottery.
   Handwritten name and address did not affect participation compared to a
   printed label. Only a moderate difference was seen between the postal
   and e-mail invitation. Others conducting similar methodological studies
   are encouraged to publish their results to expand the knowledge basis in
   this area.}},

Title = {{Effect of prepaid and promised financial incentive on follow-up survey
   response in cigarette smokers: a randomized controlled trial}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{19}},
Month = {{JUL 4}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundMonetary incentive is often used to increase response rate in
   smokers' survey, but such effect of prepaid and promised incentives in a
   follow-up survey is unknown. We compared the effect of different
   incentive schemes on the consent and retention rates in a follow-up
   survey of adult cigarette smokers.MethodsThis was a randomized
   controlled trial (RCT) in Hong Kong, China. Smokers who completed a
   non-incentivized baseline telephone smoking survey were invited to a
   3-month follow-up, with randomization into (1) the control group (no
   incentive), (2) a promised HK\$100 (US\$12.8) incentive upon completion,
   (3) a promised HK\$200 (US\$25.6) incentive upon completion, or (4) a
   prepaid HK\$100 incentive plus another promised HK\$100 incentive (mixed
   incentive). Crude risk ratios from log-binomial regression models were
   used to assess if the 3 incentive schemes predicted higher rates of
   consent at baseline or retention at 3-month than no incentive.ResultsIn
   total, 1246 smokers were enrolled. The overall consent and retention
   rates were 37.1 and 23.0\%, respectively. Both rates generally increased
   with the incentive amount and offer of prepaid incentive. The mixed
   incentive scheme marginally increased the retention rate versus no
   incentive (26.8\% vs 20.3\%; risk ratio (RR)=1.32; 95\% CI: 1.00-1.76;
   P=0.053), but not the consent rate (RR=1.13; 95\% CI: 0.93-1.38;
   P=0.22). Among the consented participants, approximately 50\% in the
   mixed incentive group received the mailed prepaid incentive, who
   achieved a higher retention rate than the group without incentives
   (82.8\% vs 56.1\%; RR=1.48; 95\% CI: 1.21-1.80; P<0.01).ConclusionThe
   mixed incentive scheme combining the prepaid and promised incentive was
   effective to increase the follow-up retention rate by 48\%. We recommend
   this mixed incentive scheme to increase the follow-up retention rate.
   More efficient methods of delivering the incentive are needed to
   maximize its effects.Trial registrationU.S. Clinical Trials registry

Abstract = {{Current primary care in Finland is based on the Primary Health Care Act
   (1972), which addressed numerous new tasks to all municipalities. All of
   them had to find a new health centre organization, which provides a wide
   range of health services, including prevention and public health
   promotion. Multiple tasks require multiprofessional staff, and thus, the
   Finnish health centre personnel consisted not only of GPs but of public
   health nurses, midwives, physiotherapists, psychologists, social
   workers, dentists, etc. During the next decade, there have been some
   changes but the idea of multiprofessional structure has remained.
   According to the QUALICOPC study (2012) Finnish GPs are still co-located
   with several other healthcare professionals compared to most of the
   European countries; even compared to other Nordic countries which
   otherwise have many similarities in their primary healthcare. During the
   last 10 or 15 years, healthcare providers and researchers have
   recognized a new challenge: our current systems do not meet the needs of
   patients with multiple health and social problems-and the proportion of
   these patients is increasing all the time as the population is getting
   older. One could suppose that preconditions of handling multimorbidity
   would be excellent in multiprofessional surroundings like ours, but
   actually, a person with multiple problems is a challenge there, too.
   Multiprofessional organization in primary care does not guarantee proper
   care of patients with multiple diseases, if we do not acknowledge the
   challenge and revise our systems. We have to develop new ways of
   collaboration and new models of integrated care. The problematic part is
   secondary care, which is organized with logic of one medical speciality
   per visit. In Tampere University Hospital district, we have created a
   care pathway model, which defines the roles of primary healthcare and
   secondary care. Nationwide, we have recently started to prepare national
   guidelines for the care of patients with multimorbidity. What we need
   more in the future is more research on new practices and models.
   Background: Most patients with antihypertensive medication do not
   achieve their blood pressure (BP) target. Several barriers to successful
   hypertension treatment are well identified but we need novel ways of
   addressing them. Research question: Can using a checklist improve the
   quality of care in the initiation of new antihypertensive medication?
   Methods: This non-blinded, cluster-randomized, controlled study was
   conducted in eight primary care study centres in central Finland,
   randomized to function as either intervention (n = 4) or control sites
   (n = 4). We included patients aged 30-75 years who were prescribed
   antihypertensive medication for the first time. Initiation of medication
   in the intervention group was carried out with a nine-item checklist,
   filled in together by the treating physician and the patient. The
   treating physician managed hypertension treatment in the control group
   without a study-specific protocol. Results: In total, 119 patients were
   included in the study, of which 118 were included in the analysis (n =
   59 in the control group, n = 59 in the intervention group). When
   initiating medication, an adequate BP target was set for 19\% of the
   patients in the control group and for 68\% in the intervention group.
   Shortly after the appointment, only 14\% of the patients in the control
   group were able to remember the adequate BP target, compared with 32\%
   in the intervention group. The use of the checklist was also related to
   more regular agreement on the next follow-up appointment (64\% in the
   control group vs 95\% in the intervention group). Conclusion: Even
   highly motivated new hypertensive patients in Finnish primary care have
   significant gaps in their treatment-related skills. The use of a
   checklist for initiation of antihypertensive medication was related to
   substantial improvement in these skills. Based on our findings, the use
   of a checklist might be a practical tool for clinicians initiating new
   antihypertensive medications.
   Background: Immediate feedback is underused in the French medical
   education curriculum, specifically with video-recorded consultation.
   Research question: The objective of this study was to evaluate the
   feasibility and the interest in this teaching method as a training and
   assessment tool in the learning process of general practitioner (GP)
   trainees. Methods: During the period November 2017 to October 2018,
   trainees in ambulatory training courses collected quantitative data
   about recording consultations with a video camera: numbers of
   recordings, feedback, patients' participation refusals, and information
   about the learning process and competencies. The trainees' level of
   satisfaction was measured by means of a questionnaire at the end of
   their traineeship. Results: Sixty-seven trainees were recruited and 44
   of them 65.7\% actively participated in the study; 607 video recordings
   and 243 feedback with trainers were performed. Few patients (18.5\%)
   refused the video-recording. Most trainees considered video recording
   with immediate feedback to be a relevant learning tool. It made it
   possible for the participants to observe their difficulties and their
   achievements. `Relation, communication, patient-centred care' was the
   most built competency, non-verbal communication, in particular. Time was
   the main limiting factor of this teaching method. Most trainees were in
   favour of its generalization in their university course. Conclusion:
   Video recording with immediate feedback in real-time consultation needs
   to be adapted to training areas and depends on time and logistics. This
   teaching method seems to be useful in the development of communication
   skills. It could lift the barriers of the trainer's physical presence
   near GP trainees during immediate feedback in real-time consultation. It
   could help trainees to build their competencies while enhancing the
   place of immediate feedback in the general practice curriculum. It could
   also constitute an additional tool for the certification of GP trainees.
   Background: Perinatal depression has been associated with psychiatric
   morbidity in mothers and their offspring. This study assessed the
   prevalence of perinatal depressive symptoms in a large population of
   women and investigated associations of these symptoms with demographic
   and clinical factors. Research question: Which factors (including
   sociodemographic, medical, lifestyle, and laboratory test) are
   associated with perinatal depression? Methods: All members of Maccabi
   Health Services who completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale
   (EPDS) during 2015-2016 were included in the study. Odds ratios (ORs)
   were calculated for associations of sociodemographic, medical,
   lifestyle, and laboratory test factors with perinatal depressive
   symptoms, according to a score >10 on the EPDS. Results: Of 27 912 women
   who filled the EPDS, 2029 (7.3\%) were classified as having peripartum
   depression. In a logistic regression analysis, the use of antidepressant
   medications, particularly for a period greater than three months, Arab
   background, current or past smoking, a diagnosis of chronic diabetes and
   age under 25 years were all associated with increased ORs for perinatal
   depression; while Orthodox Jewish affiliation, residence in the
   periphery and higher haemoglobin level were associated with lower ORs.
   Incidences of depression were 17.4\% in women with a history of
   antidepressant medication, 16\% among women with diabetes, and 11.8\%
   among current smokers. Conclusion: Several demographic, medical, and
   lifetime factors were found to be substantially more prevalent among
   women with symptoms of perinatal depression than those without.
   Encouraging women to complete the EPDS during and following pregnancy
   may help identify women in need of support.
   Background: Regulating the quality and effectiveness of the work of
   general practitioners is essential for a sound healthcare system. In the
   Republic of Macedonia this is regulated by the Health Insurance Fund
   through a system of penalties/sanctions. Research question: The goal of
   this study is to evaluate the types and effectiveness of the sanctions
   used on primary care practitioners. Methods: This is a quantitative
   research study for which we used an anonymous survey with 18 questions.
   This survey was distributed to 443 randomly selected general
   practitioners from different parts of Macedonia and 438 of them
   responded. For the quantitative data, we used the Pearson's chi-squared
   test, correlation and descriptive statistics. Part of the survey is
   qualitative, consisting of comments and opinions of the general
   practitioners. Results: From the participants, 336 were female and 102
   were male. The doctors' gender was not associated with sanctioning. Most
   general practitioners were in the age categories of 30-39 and 40-49
   years. The participants' age had a significant influence on
   sanctioning-older doctors were sanctioned more frequently. Out of 438
   participants, 33.3\% were specialists in family medicine and 66.7\%
   general practitioners. Specialists in family medicine were sanctioned
   significantly more frequently than general practitioners. Doctors that
   worked in the hospital or 19 km from the nearest hospital were
   significantly more frequently sanctioned. The three most common reasons
   for sanctions were financial consumption of prescriptions and referrals
   above the agreed amount, higher rate of sick leaves and/or justification
   of sick leaves and unrealized preventative goals or education.
   `Financial sanction by scale' was the most common type of sanction:
   49.8\% of participants. Doctors who followed the guidelines, but who
   were exposed to violence were sanctioned significantly more frequently.
   Conclusion: We can observe that age, speciality, the distance of the
   workplace from the nearest hospital and violence influence sanctioning.
   Background: Biases are major barriers to external validity of studies,
   reducing evidence. Among these biases, the definition and the reality of
   the Hawthorne effect (HE) (or observation bias) remains controversial.
   According to McCambridge in a review from 2013, the Hawthorne effect is
   a behaviour change occurring when the subject is being observed during a
   scientific study. This effect would be multifactorial, and he suggests
   the term `effects of research participation.' However, the reviewed
   studies were conflicting and evidence is sparse. Research question: We
   updated McCambridge's review to actualize the definition of the HE.
   Methods: McCambridge's most recent article dated back to January 3,
   2012. We focused on the articles published between January 1, 2012 and
   August 10, 2018 searching Medline. We used the sole keyword `Hawthorne
   Effect.' The search was filtered based on the dates, the availability of
   an abstract and the languages English and French. We included articles
   defining or evaluating the HE. Articles citing the effect without
   defining it or irrelevant to the topic were excluded. Two independent
   readers searched and analysed the articles. Discrepancies were solved by
   consensus. Results: Out of 106 articles, 42 articles were included. All
   the articles acknowledged an observation bias, considered as significant
   or not, depending on the population (education, literacy), the methods
   and the variable of interest. It was a psychological change, limited in
   time. The HE was defined as a change of behaviour related to direct or
   indirect observation of the subjects or the investigators, to their
   previous selection and commitment in the study (written agreement) and
   to social desirability. Despite observations, articles were conflicting.
   Some do confirm the existence of the HE, others deny it. Meta-analysis
   is ongoing. Conclusion: No formal consensus regarding the definition of
   the effect has been reached so far. However, the authors agree on its
   implication as an experimental artefact.
   Background: Polypharmacy and multimorbidity are on the rise.
   Consequently, general practitioners (GPs) treat an increasing number of
   multimorbid patients with polypharmacy. To limit negative health
   outcomes, GPs should search for inappropriate medication intake in such
   patients. However, systematic medication reviews are time-consuming.
   Recent eHealth tools, such as the `systematic tool to reduce
   inappropriate prescribing' (STRIP) assistant, provide an opportunity for
   GPs to get support when conducting such medication reviews. Research
   question: Can the STRIP assistant as electronic decision support help
   GPs to optimize medication appropriateness in older, multimorbid
   patients with polypharmacy? Methods: This cluster randomized controlled
   trial is conducted in 40 Swiss GP practices, each recruiting 8-10
   patients aged >= 65 years, with >= 3 chronic conditions and >= 5 chronic
   medications (320 patients in total). We compare the effectiveness of
   using the STRIP assistant for optimizing medication appropriateness to
   usual care. The STRIP assistant is based on the STOPP/START criteria
   (version 2) and, for this trial, it is implemented in the Swiss eHealth
   setting where some GPs already share routine medical data from their
   electronic medical records in a research database (FIRE). Patients are
   followed-up for 12 months and the change in medication appropriateness
   is the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes are the numbers of falls and
   fractures, quality of life, health economic parameters, patients'
   willingness to deprescribe as well as implementation barriers and
   enablers for GPs when using the STRIP assistant. Results: Patient
   recruitment started in December 2018. This presentation focuses on the
   study protocol and the challenges faced when testing this new software
   in Swiss primary care. Conclusion: Finding out whether the STRIP
   assistant is an effective tool and beneficial for older and multimorbid
   patients, who are usually excluded from trials, will have an impact on
   the coordination of chronic care for multimorbid patients in Swiss
   primary care in this new eHealth environment.
   Background: Workplace violence (WPV) towards healthcare staff is
   becoming a common problem in different healthcare settings worldwide.
   Moreover, the prevalence is 16 times higher than in other professions.
   How often it happened towards young doctors working as general
   practitioners (GPs) at the beginning of their careers has been rarely
   studied. Research question: To investigate the frequency and forms of
   WPV, experienced by the young Croatian GPs from their patients, and
   violence reporting pattern to the competent institutions. Methods: The
   cross-sectional study was carried out on 74 GP residents, during their
   postgraduate study in family medicine in May 2018. A specially designed
   anonymous questionnaire, developed by Association of Family Physicians
   of South Eastern Europe, was used to investigate the prevalence and
   forms of WPV, the narrative description of the traumatic event itself
   and the process of reporting it. Results: The response rate was 91.9\%,
   female 87\%, the median of years working as a GP was 3.5 years. Most of
   the residents were working in an urban practice (63\%), others in the
   rural and the suburban once (27\%, 10\%). All GP residents experienced
   patients' and caregivers' violent behaviour directed towards them.
   High-intensity violence (e.g. physical violence, sexual harassment) was
   experienced by 44\%, middle intensity (e.g. intimidation, visual sexual
   harassment) by 84\% while all residents experienced verbal violence.
   Only 13.2\% residents reported WPV to the competent institutions. Most
   of GP residents reported the appearance of the new form of violence: the
   one over the internet. Conclusion: The high prevalence of all types of
   violence towards young Croatian doctors is worrisome, as is the fact
   that violent acts are seldom reported to the competent institutions.
   Those alarming facts could become a threat to GPs career choosing.
   Background: About 50\% of patients adhere to chronic therapy in France.
   Improving adherence should improve their care. Identifying the patient's
   difficulties in taking medication is complex for the physician, because
   there is no gold standard for measuring adherence to medications. How
   can the general practitioner in his/her practice identify patient
   compliance? Research question: Analyse studies that develop or validate
   scales used to estimate adherence in primary care. Methods: A systematic
   review of the literature from PubMed, the Cochrane Library and PsycINFO
   databases. The search terms used were the MeSH terms (or adapted to the
   database's vocabulary): questionnaire, compliance and primary care. All
   articles were retained whatever the language of writing. Selection
   criteria were: assessment of the development, validation or reliability
   of one or more compliance scales; taking place in primary care. One
   reviewer screened titles, which included the term adherence then
   abstracts and full text. Only articles evaluating the development,
   validity or reliability of a primary care adherence rating scale were
   included in analysis. Results: In total 1022 articles were selected and
   18 articles were included. Seventeen adherence scales were identified in
   primary care, most of which targeted a single pathology, especially
   hypertension. The most cited scale is the MMAS Morisky medication
   adherence scale. Three scales were developed for patients with multiple
   chronic diseases. One scale was developed for patients older than 65
   years-the Strathclyde compliance risk assessment tool (SCRAT)-and two
   scales were developed for adult patients whatever their age-the
   instrument developed by Sidorkiewicz et al., and the DAMS, diagnostic
   adherence to medication scale. Conclusion: Two scales have been
   developed and validated in primary care to assess patient adherence with
   multiple chronic diseases: the DAMS and the instrument developed by
   Sidorkiewicz et al. A simple, reliable, reproducible primary care scale
   would assess the impact of actions developed to improve adherence:
   motivational interviewing, patient therapeutic education, and the ASALeE
   protocol.
   Background: Multimorbidity prevalence increases with age while declining
   quality of life (QoL) is one of its major consequences. Research
   question: The study aims to: (1) Assess the relationship between
   increasing number of diseases and QoL. (2) Identify the most frequently
   occurring patterns of diseases and how they relate to QoL. (3) Observe
   how these associations differ across different European countries and
   regions. Methods: Cross-sectional data analysis performed on wave six of
   the population-based survey of health, ageing and retirement in Europe
   (SHARE) (n = 68 231). Data were collected in 2015 among population 50+
   years old in 17 European countries and Israel. Multimorbidity is defined
   as the co-occurrence of two or more chronic conditions. Conditions were
   self-declared and identified through an open-end questionnaire
   containing 17 prelisted conditions plus conditions added by
   participants. Control, autonomy, self-realization and pleasure
   questionnaire (CASP-12v) was used to evaluate QoL. Association between
   increasing number of diseases and QoL was assessed with linear
   regression. Factor analysis is being conducted to identify patterns of
   diseases to evaluate their impact on QoL further. Multilevel analysis
   will take into account differences between countries and regions.
   Confounding was searched with directed acyclic graph (DAG) method and
   included age, sex, education, socio-economic status, behavioural habits,
   social support and healthcare parameters. Results: Participants
   (49.09\%) had two or more diseases. Maximum number of diseases per
   person was 13, mean number was 1.9. Unadjusted preliminary analysis
   showed that on average QoL decreases by -1.27 (95\%CI: -1.29, -1.24)
   with each added new condition across Europe. The decline appears to be
   the steepest in Spain, -1.61 (95\%CI: -1.71, -1.51), and the least so in
   Israel, -0.67 (95\%CI: -0.82, -0.52). Conclusion: Ongoing analysis will
   identify disease patterns, which may have the highest impact on QoL, as
   well as to elucidate the role of confounders in the relationship between
   increasing number of diseases and disease patterns with QoL.
   Background: The burden and preventive potential of disease is typically
   estimated for each non-communicable disease (NCD) separately but NCDs
   often co-occur, which hampers reliable quantification of their overall
   burden and joint preventive potential in the population. Research
   questions: What is the lifetime risk of developing any NCD? Which
   multimorbidity clusters of NCDs cause the greatest burden? To what
   extent do three key shared risk factors, namely smoking, hypertension
   and being overweight, influence this risk, life-expectancy and
   NCD-multimorbidity? Methods: Between 1990 and 2012 we followed NCD-free
   participants aged >= 45 years at baseline from the Dutch prospective
   Rotterdam study for incidents of stroke, heart disease, diabetes,
   chronic respiratory disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative disease. We
   quantified (co-)occurrence and remaining lifetime risk of NCDs in a
   competing risk framework, and studied the effects of smoking,
   hypertension, and being overweight on lifetime risk and life expectancy.
   Results: During follow-up of 9061 participants, 814 participants were
   diagnosed with stroke, 1571 with heart disease, 625 with diabetes, 1004
   with chronic respiratory disease, 1538 with cancer, and 1065 with
   neurodegenerative disease. Among those, 1563 participants (33.7\%) were
   diagnosed with multiple diseases. The lifetime risk of any NCD from the
   age of 45 onwards was 94.0\% (95\%CI: 92.9-95.1) for men and 92.8\%
   (95\%CI: 91.8-93.8) for women. Absence of shared risk factors was
   associated with a 9.0-year delay (95\%CI: 6.3-11.6) in the age at onset
   of any NCD. Furthermore, overall life expectancy for participants
   without risk factors was 6.0 years (95\%CI: 5.7-7.9) longer than those
   with these risk factors. Participants without these risk factors spent
   21.6\% of their remaining lifetime with NCDs, compared to 31.8\% for
   those with risk factors. Conclusion: Nine out of 10 individuals aged 45
   years and older will develop at least one NCD during their remaining
   lifetime. A third was diagnosed with multiple NCDs during follow-up.
   Absence of three common shared risk factors related to compression of
   morbidity of NCDs.
   Background: This study examined if using electronic reminders increases
   the rate of diagnosis recordings in the patient chart system following
   visits to a general practitioner (GP). The impact of electronic
   reminders was studied in the primary care of a Finnish city. Research
   question: How effective is the reminder of the information system in
   improving the diagnostic level of primary care? Which is better and how:
   financial incentives or reminders? Methods: This was an observational
   retrospective study based on a before-and-after design and was carried
   out by installing an electronic reminder in the computerized patient
   chart system to improve the recording of diagnoses during GP visits. The
   quality of the recorded diagnoses was observed before and after the
   intervention. The effect of this intervention on the recording of
   diagnoses was also studied. Results: Before intervention, the level of
   recording diagnoses was about 40\% in the primary care units. After four
   years, the recording rate had risen to 90\% (p < 0.001). The rate of
   change in the recording of diagnoses was highest during the first year
   of intervention. In the present study, most of the visits concerned mild
   respiratory infections, elevated blood pressure, low back pain and type
   II diabetes. Conclusion: An electronic reminder improved the recording
   of diagnoses during the visits to GPs. The present intervention produced
   data, which reflects the distribution of diagnoses in real clinical life
   in primary care and thus provides valid data about the public.
   Background: Child abuse is widespread, occurs in all cultures and
   communities and remains undiscovered in 90\% of the cases. In total,
   80\% of reported child abuse concerns emotional ill-treatment. In the
   Netherlands, at least 3\% (118 000) of children are victims of child
   abuse resulting in 50 deaths each year. Only 1-3\% of abuse cases are
   reported by general practitioners (GPs) to the Child Protective Services
   agency (CPS). To explain this low reporting rate, we examined GPs'
   experiences with child abuse. Research question: How does the suspicion
   of child abuse arise in GPs' diagnostic reasoning? How do they act upon
   their suspicion and what kind of barriers do they experience in their
   management? Methods: In total 26 GPs (16 female) participated in four
   focus groups. We used purposive sampling to include GPs with different
   levels of experience in rural and urban areas spread over the
   Netherlands. We used NVivo for thematic content analysis. Results:
   Suspected child abuse arose based on common triggers and a gut feeling
   that `something is wrong here'. GPs acted upon their suspicion by
   gathering more data by history taking and physical examination. They
   often found it challenging to decide whether a child was abused because
   parents, despite their good intentions, may lack parenting skills and
   differ in their norms and values. GPs reported clear signs of sexual
   abuse and physical violence to CPS. However, in less clear-cut cases
   they followed-up and built a supporting network around the family. Most
   GPs highly valued the patient-doctor relationship while recognizing the
   risk of pushing boundaries. Conclusion: A low child abuse reporting rate
   by GPs to CPS does not mean a low detection rate. GPs use patients'
   trust in their doctor to improve a child's situation by involving other
   professionals.
   Background: The number of people suffering from multiple chronic
   conditions, multimorbidity, is rising. For society, multimorbidity is
   known to increase healthcare expenses through more frequent contacts,
   especially with the primary sector. For the individual, an increasing
   number of medical conditions are associated with lower quality of life
   (QoL). However, there is no statistically validated condition-specific
   patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) for the assessment of QoL among
   patients with multimorbidity. A validated PROM is essential in order to
   measure effect in intervention studies for this patient group. Research
   question: (1) To identify items covering QoL among patients with
   multimorbidity in a Danish context. (2) To develop and validate a PROM
   for assessment of QoL among patients with multimorbidity. (3) To utilize
   the final PROM in a large group of patients with multimorbidity to
   measure their QoL when living with different combinations and severity
   of multimorbidity. Methods: Phase 1: qualitative individual and focus
   group interviews with patients with multimorbidity to identify relevant
   QoL items. Phase 2: validation of the items through a draft
   questionnaire sent by email to around 200-400 patients with
   multimorbidity. Phase 3: psychometric validation of the draft
   questionnaire securing items with the highest possible measurement
   quality. Phase 4: assessment of QoL among approximately 2000 patients
   with multimorbidity from the Danish Lolland-Falster study. Results:
   There are no results yet. Currently, the interview guide is under
   development. Conclusion: Despite the rising number of patients with
   multimorbidity and the known inverse relationship between a patient's
   number of medical conditions and their quality of life, there is no
   statistically validated condition-specific PROM for assessment of QoL
   among this group. Our aim is that this project's developed and validated
   PROM will be used in future intervention studies as a valid measure of
   QoL among patients with multimorbidity.
   Background: Through a systematic review of the literature and
   qualitative research across Europe, the European General Practitioners
   Research Network (EGPRN) has designed and validated a comprehensive
   definition of multimorbidity. It is a concept considering all the
   biopsychosocial conditions of a patient. This concept encompasses more
   than 50 variables and is consequently difficult to use in primary care.
   Consideration of adverse outcomes (such as death or acute
   hospitalization) could help to distinguish which variables could be risk
   factors of decompensation within the definition of multimorbidity.
   Research question: Which criteria in the EGPRN concept of multimorbidity
   could detect outpatients at risk of death or acute hospitalization (i.e.
   decompensation) in a primary care cohort at 24-months of follow-up?
   Methods: Primary care outpatients (131) answering to EGPRN's
   multimorbidity definition were included by GPs, during two periods of
   inclusion in 2014 and 2015. At 24 months follow-up, the status
   `decompensation' or `nothing to report' was collected. A logistic
   regression following a Cox model was performed to achieve the survival
   analysis and to identify potential risk factors. Results: At 24 months
   follow-up, 120 patients were analysed. Three different clusters were
   identified. Forty-four patients, representing 36.6\% of the population,
   had either died or been hospitalized more than seven consecutive days.
   Two variables were significantly associated with decompensation: Number
   of GPs encounters per year (HR: 1.06; 95\%CI: 1.03-1.10, p <0.001), and
   total number of diseases (HR: 1.12; 95\%CI: 1.03-1.33; P = 0.039).
   Conclusion: To prevent death or acute hospitalization in multimorbid
   outpatients, GPs may be alert to those with high rates of GP encounters
   or a high number of illnesses. These results are consistent with others
   in medical literature.
   Background: A study of casual versus causal comorbidity in family
   medicine in three practice populations from the Netherlands, Malta and
   Serbia. Research question: (1) What is the observed comorbidity of the
   20 most common episodes of care in three countries? (2) How much of the
   observed comorbidity is likely to be casual versus causal? Methods:
   Participating family doctors (FDs) in the Netherlands, Malta and Serbia
   recorded details of all patient contacts in an episode of care structure
   using electronic medical records based on the International
   Classification of Primary Care, collecting data on all elements of the
   doctor-patient encounter, including the diagnostic labels (episode of
   care labels, EoCs). Comorbidity was measured using the odds ratio of
   both conditions being incident or rest-prevalent in the same patient in
   one-year data frames, as against not. Results: Comorbidity in family
   practice expressed as odds ratios between the 41 most prevalent (joint
   top 20) episode titles in the three populations. Specific associations
   were explored in different age groups to observe the changes in odds
   ratios with increasing age as a surrogate for a temporal or biological
   gradient. Conclusion: After applying accepted criteria for testing the
   causality of associations, it is reasonable to conclude that most of the
   observed primary care comorbidity is casual. It would be incorrect to
   assume causal relationships between co-occurring diseases in family
   medicine, even if such a relationship might be plausible or consistent
   with current conceptualizations of the causation of disease. Most
   observed comorbidity in primary care is the result of increasing illness
   diversity.
   Background: The concept of therapeutic alliance emerged in the beginning
   of the twentieth century and came from psychoanalysis. This notion was
   then extended to the somatic field and aims to replace the paternalistic
   model in the doctor-patient relationship. The EGPRN TATA group selected
   the WAI SR as the most reliable and reproducible scale to assess
   therapeutic alliance. To use it within Europe, it was necessary to
   translate it into most European languages. The following study aimed to
   assess the linguistic homogeneity of five of these translations.
   Research question: Are the translations of the WAI SR homogeneous
   between Spain, Poland, Slovenia, France and Italy? Methods:
   Forward-backward translations were achieved in five participating
   countries (Spain, Poland, France, Slovenia and Italy). Using a Delphi
   procedure, a global homogeneity check was then performed by comparing
   the five backward translations during a physical meeting involving GP
   teachers/researchers from many European countries; the heterogeneity of
   the participants' origins was a token of reliability. Results: In the
   assessment of the five translations, 107 experts participated. A
   consensus was obtained in one to two Delphi rounds for each. During the
   `homogeneity check,' some discrepancies were noted with the original
   version and were discussed with the local teams. This last stage
   permitted to highlight cultural discrepancies and real translation
   issues and to correct if needed. Conclusion: Five homogeneous versions
   of the WAI SR are now available in five European languages. They will be
   helpful to evaluate therapeutic alliance at different levels: for GPs in
   daily practice, for students during the initial and continuous training,
   and for further research in these five countries.
   Background: The patient enablement instrument (PEI) is an established
   patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) that reflects the quality of a
   GP appointment. It is a six-item questionnaire, addressed to the patient
   immediately after a consultation. Research question: The study aimed to
   evaluate whether a single-item measure (the Q1), based on the PEI, or a
   single question extracted from the PEI itself (the Q2) could replace the
   PEI when measuring patient enablement among Finnish healthcare centre
   patients. Methods: The study design included (1) a pilot study with
   brief interviews with the respondents, (2) a questionnaire study before
   and after a single appointment with a GP, and (3) a telephone interview
   two weeks after the appointment. The correlations between the measures
   were examined. The sensitivity, specificity and both positive and
   negative predictive values for the Q1 and the Q2 were calculated, with
   different PEI score cut-off points. Results: Altogether 483 patients
   with completed PEIs were included in the analyses. The correlations
   between the PEI and the Q1 or the Q2 were 0.48 and 0.84, respectively.
   Both the Q1 and the Q2 had high sensitivity and negative predictive
   value in relation to patients with lower enablement scores. The
   reliability coefficients were 0.24 for the Q1 and 0.76 for the Q2.
   Conclusion: The Q2 seems to be a valid and reliable way to measure
   patient enablement. The Q1 seems to be less correlated with the PEI, but
   it also has high negative predictive value in relation to low enablement
   scores.
   Multimorbidity challenges existing healthcare organization and research,
   which remains disease and single-condition focused. Basic science
   approaches to multimorbidity have the potential to identify important
   shared mechanisms by which diseases we currently think of as distinct
   might arise, but there is a pressing need for more applied and health
   services research to understand better and manage multimorbidity now.
   There are several recent clinical guidelines, which make recommendations
   for managing multimorbidity or related issues for patients such as
   polypharmacy and frailty. However, the evidence base underpinning these
   recommendations is often weak, and these guidelines, therefore, also
   help define a research agenda. A key problem for researchers and health
   services is that multimorbidity is very heterogeneous, in that
   `intermittent low back pain plus mild eczema' presents very different
   challenges to researchers and health services compared to `active
   psychosis plus severe heart failure'. Identifying important but
   tractable research questions is therefore not always straightforward.
   This presentation will identify important gaps in the evidence, and
   illustrate how they might be filled. The focus will be on two areas
   where there is consensus that better evidence is needed to inform care
   design and delivery: (1) organizational interventions to implement more
   coordinated and holistic care; and (2) interventions to improve
   medicines management in people with multimorbidity and polypharmacy.
   These illustrate both the potential for imaginative research, but also
   the scale.
   Background: The accumulation of multiple chronic diseases
   (multimorbidity) and multiple prescribed medications (polypharmacy) over
   time may influence the extent to which an individual maintains health
   and well-being in later life. Research question: This research aims to
   describe the patterns (sequence and timing) of multimorbidity and
   polypharmacy that accumulate over time among primary healthcare patients
   in Canada. Methods: Data are derived from the Canadian primary care
   sentinel surveillance network (CPCSSN) electronic medical record (EMR)
   database that holds >= 1 million longitudinal, de-identified records.
   Multimorbidity will be identified with 20 categories, cut-off points of
   >= 2 and >= 3 chronic conditions and the International Classification of
   Disease (ICD) classification system. Polypharmacy will be identified
   using the cut-off points of >= 5 and >= 10 medication classes and the
   Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system. Analyses
   will be conducted using Java and Stata 14.2 software. Results: The
   prevalence of chronic diseases and prescribed medications will be
   presented, as well as the patterns that are observed among adults and
   older adults in Canada. The most frequent patterns (combinations and
   permutations) of multimorbidity and polypharmacy will be presented,
   stratified by sex and age category. The relationships with other
   factors, such as the presence of frailty, disability or increased health
   service use, will be examined. As well, the methodological challenges to
   identifying the presence and sequence of multimorbidity and polypharmacy
   in national, longitudinal data will be discussed. Conclusion: This
   research will explore the profiles of multimorbidity and polypharmacy in
   mid- and late-life using a national, longitudinal database. These
   findings can be used strategically to inform healthcare delivery and to
   contribute to the understanding of multimorbidity and polypharmacy in
   the international literature. Reducing the burden of prescribed
   medications and the harms of polypharmacy are key tasks within the
   context of multimorbidity.
   Background: Multimorbidity and polypharmacy have become the norm for
   general practitioners (GPs). Ideally, GPs search for inappropriate
   medication and, if necessary, deprescribe. However, it remains
   challenging to deprescribe given time constraints and little backup from
   guidelines. Furthermore, barriers and enablers to deprescribing among
   patients have to be accounted for. Research question: To identify
   barriers and enablers to deprescribing in older patients with
   polypharmacy. Methods: We surveyed among patients >70 years with
   multimorbidity (>2 chronic conditions) and polypharmacy (>4 regular
   medicines). We invited Swiss GPs to recruit eligible patients, each of
   whom completed a paper-based survey on demography, medications and
   chronic conditions. We applied the revised patients' attitudes towards
   deprescribing (rPATD) questionnaire and added 12 additional questions
   and two open questions to assess barriers and enablers towards
   deprescribing. Results: We analysed the first 221 responses received so
   far and full results will be presented at the conference. Participants
   were 79.3 years in mean (SD 5.8) and 48\% female. Thirty-one percent
   lived alone, and 85\% prepared their medication themselves, all others
   required help. Seventy-six percent of participants took 5-9 regular
   medicines and 24\% took >= 10 up to 22 medicines. Participants (76\%)
   were willing to deprescribe one or more of their medicines and 78\% did
   not have any negative experience with deprescribing. Age and gender were
   not associated with their willingness to deprescribe. Important barriers
   to deprescribing were satisfaction with drugs (96\%), long-term drugs
   (56\%) and noticing positive effects when taking them (92\%). When it
   comes to deprescribing, 89\% of participants wanted as much information
   as possible on their medicines. Having a good relationship with their GP
   was a further key factor to them (85\%). Conclusion: Most older adults
   are willing to deprescribe. They would like to be informed about their
   medicines and want to discuss deprescribing to achieve shared
   decision-making with the GP they trust.
   Background: With growing populations of patients with multimorbidity,
   general practitioners need insight into which patients in their practice
   are most in need for person-centred integrated care ('high-need'
   patients). Using data from electronic primary care medical records to
   automatically create a list of possible `high need' patients could be a
   quick and easy first step to assist GPs in identifying these patients.
   Research question: Can `high need' patients with multimorbidity be
   identified automatically from their primary care medical records?
   Methods: Pseudonymized medical records of patients with multimorbidity
   (>= 2 chronic diseases) were analysed. Data was derived from the Nivel
   primary care database, a large registry containing data routinely
   recorded in electronic health records. This includes data on healthcare
   use, health problems and treatment. Logistic regression analysis was
   conducted to predict outcomes (frequent contact with the general
   practice, ER visits and unplanned hospital admissions). Predictors were
   age, sex, healthcare use in the previous year, morbidity and medication
   use. Results: In total, 245 065 patients with multimorbidity were
   identified, of which 48\% were above the age of 65 and 57\% female. More
   than 42\% had five GP contacts in the previous year and 62\% used five
   or more different medications. Frequent contact with the general
   practice could be reliably predicted using only the number of contacts
   in the previous year (AUC: 0.82). Adding all other predictors (including
   specific chronic conditions) only improved the predictive value of the
   model marginally (AUC: 0.84). Identifying patients with a high risk for
   ER visits and unplanned hospital admissions proved more difficult (AUC:
   0.67 and 0.70, respectively). Conclusion: `High need' patients with
   multimorbidity can be automatically selected from primary care medical
   records using only the number of contacts with the general practice in
   the previous year. Composing a list of these patients can help GPs to
   identify those eligible for person-centred integrated care.
   Background: Chronic diseases usually have a long duration and slow
   progression and, as a result, they tend to aggregate in multimorbidity
   patterns (MPs) during the life course and/or due to shared underlying
   pathophysiological pathways. Knowledge of how MPs progress over time is
   necessary to develop effective prevention management strategies.
   Research question: What are the most likely MPs over time? Which
   longitudinal shifts from one pattern to another occur during follow-up?
   Methods: A prospective longitudinal study based on electronic health
   records was conducted during 2012-2016 in Catalonia, Spain. For people
   aged >= 65 years, we extracted data on demographics and diagnostic codes
   for chronic diseases (ICD-10). Machine-learning techniques were applied
   for the identification of disease clusters using fuzzy c-means analysis
   to obtain initial clusters. To estimate longitudinal MPs and their
   progression for each individual a hidden Markov model was fitted,
   estimating: (1) the transition probability matrix between clusters; (2)
   the initial cluster probability; (3) the most likely trajectory for each
   individual. The prevalence of disease in each cluster, observed/expected
   ratios (O/E ratios) and disease exclusivity was determined for each MP.
   Criteria used to designate cluster: O/E ratio >= 2. Results: In total,
   916 619 individuals were included. Ten MPs were identified. The cluster
   including the most prevalent diseases was designated non-specific
   (42.0\% of individuals). The remaining nine clusters included the
   following anatomical systems: ophthalmologic and mental diseases
   (19.3\%), osteometabolic (7.9\%), cardio-circulatory (6.6\%), and
   others. Most patients, minimum 59.2\%, remained in the same cluster
   during the study period. The highest transitions to the mortality state
   were observed in the cardio-circulatory (37.1\%) and nervous (31.8\%)
   MPs. Conclusion: Ten significant longitudinal MPs were found. The
   application of sophisticated statistical techniques ideally suited the
   study of the MPs and allowed for characterization over time. This method
   is useful to establish a probabilistic evolution of MPs.
   Background: Quality of life is an essential theme for quantitative
   surveys in primary care. Treatments and procedures need to be assessed
   on whether they change patients' quality of life. This has led to the
   creation of evaluation scales. The purpose of this study was to
   determine reproducibility and efficiency of 11 previously selected
   quality of life scales (selected with a systematic review) for the
   general population. Research question: What is the best possible
   reproducible and efficient quality of life scale for the general
   population? Methods: The search was conducted from November 2017 to
   April 2018 in PubMed and Cochrane databases, according to the PRISMA
   (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses)
   protocol. The inclusion criteria were the psychometric qualities for
   each of the 11 scales studied. Articles dealing with subpopulations or
   those not written in IMRAD format were excluded. The collected values
   were reproducibility and efficiency. Results: Out of 206, 46 selected
   articles were included. Cronbach's alpha by domain and Pearson's
   coefficient were the most analysed psychometrics. No valid efficiency
   data was obtained. The internal consistency was over 0.7 for the SF-36,
   SF12v2 and EQ-5D scales. The Pearson coefficient was over 0.4 for the
   SF36v2, SF-12 and SF-12v2 scales. The Cohen's kappa ranged from 0.4 to
   0.80 for the EQ-5D questionnaire. Conclusion: No scale is fully
   validated. Reproducibility values were incomplete (Cronbach's alpha and
   Pearson's most expressed). No efficiency data was found. The most
   validated scales are the SF family and the EQ-5D. Researchers and
   clinicians should be aware of these limitations when choosing a quality
   of life scale. They should return to the scales' designs to choose the
   one that underlines the type of quality of life they want to assess as
   no external validity is available.
   Background: Previous studies have shown an increased rate of infection
   among patients with diabetes; however, it is unclear from these studies
   if the level of HbA1c is correlated with infection. Research question:
   This study aimed to examine the association between glycaemic control of
   type 2 diabetes patients and the incidence of infections. Methods: An
   HMO database was used to identify all DM patients. The first HbA1c test
   during the period of the study was selected for each patient; then an
   infection diagnosis was searched in the 60 days that followed the test.
   We compared the HbA1c test results that were followed by an infection to
   those that were not. After applying exclusion criteria: having cancer,
   receiving immunosuppressive medication, undergoing dialysis treatment,
   anaemia less than 9 mg\%, and G6PD deficiency, there remained 33 637
   patients in the cohort. The study period was October 2014 to September
   2017. The following information was collected: age, gender,
   socio-economic index, BMI, use of hypoglycaemic and steroid medication
   in the 90 days before infection, and comorbid conditions (IHD, PVD, CVA,
   CCF, asthma, COPD, Parkinson's disease, dementia, CRF). Results: In
   total, 804 patients had an infection within 60 days following an HbA1c
   test. For cellulitis, cholecystitis, herpes zoster, pneumonia and
   sinusitis the HbA1c was higher than those patients that had no infection
   (for cellulitis 7.603 vs 7.243). When factored into logistic regression
   analysis, we found that other chronic diseases increased the risk of
   infection between 29 and 60\%. Each increase of a gram of HbA1c
   increased the risk by 8.5\%. Use of steroids in the 90 days before the
   infection increases the chance of infection by 734\%. Conclusion:
   Increasing HbA1c and comorbidity both increase the risk of infection
   among type 2 diabetics but use of oral or injectable steroids is a much
   more significant risk factor.}},

   for general practitioner (GP) care. Study design Discrete choice
   experiment. Methods A random sample of 704 adults and of 181 diabetics
   were independently surveyed to elicit patients' preferences for common
   disease diagnosis and diabetes care. Mixed logit regression was used for
   the analysis. Results On average, the most valued attribute in GP care
   are the organizational factors related to whether the provider has
   sufficient medicine and equipment to provide capable primary care
   service. Policy incentives, such as reducing waiting time, providing
   prior expert access, and increasing Medicare reimbursement, can
   facilitate the utilization of the GP system. Significant preference
   heterogeneity was identified; specifically, patient preferences
   significantly differ with regard to demand for common disease diagnosis
   and diabetes care. Conclusion The identification of the preferences of
   specific groups in regard to GP care is an organizational and political
   imperative. Policy incentives are useful tools to guide patients' health
   care seeking behavior. To change the perceptions of Chinese patients
   with regard to health care, policy makers should consider the
   heterogeneous responses of residents to policy incentives and focus
   their efforts on key cohorts.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess the availability and price of naloxone as well as
   pharmacy staff knowledge of the standing order for naloxone in
   Pennsylvania pharmacies.
   Methods: We conducted a telephone audit study from December 2016 to
   April 2017 in which staff from Pennsylvania pharmacies were surveyed to
   evaluate naloxone availability, staff understanding of the naloxone
   standing order, and out-of-pocket cost of naloxone.
   Results: Responses were obtained from 682 of 758 contacted pharmacies
   (90\% response rate). Naloxone was stocked (ie, available for
   dispensing) in 306 (45\%) pharmacies surveyed. Of the 376 (55\%)
   pharmacies that did not stock naloxone, 118 (31\%) stated that they
   could place an order for naloxone for pickup within 1 business day.
   Responses by pharmacy staff to questions about key components of the
   standing order for naloxone were collected from 581 of the 682
   pharmacies who participated in the survey (85\%). Of the 581 pharmacy
   staff members who stated that they either stocked or could order
   naloxone, 64\% correctly answered all questions pertaining to
   understanding of the naloxone standing order. The respective median
   out-of-pocket prices stated in the audit varied by formulation and
   ranged from \$50 to \$4000. Staff from national pharmacies were
   significantly more likely than staff from regional/local chain and
   non-chain pharmacies to correctly answer that a prescription was not
   required to obtain naloxone (68.5\%, 57.7\%, and 52.4\% respectively, (P
   = 0.0045).
   Conclusions: Multiple barriers to naloxone access exist in pharmacies
   across a large, diverse state, despite the presence of a standing order
   to facilitate such access. Limited availability of naloxone in
   pharmacies, lack of knowledge or understanding by pharmacy staff of the
   standing order, and variability in out-of-pocket cost for this drug are
   among these potential barriers. Regulatory or legal incentives for
   pharmacies or drug manufacturers, education efforts directed toward
   pharmacy staff members, or other interventions may be needed to increase
   naloxone availability in pharmacies.}},

Abstract = {{Background The generalizability of data derived from patient-reported
   outcome measures (PROMs) depends largely on the proportion of the
   relevant population that completes PROM surveys. However, PROM survey
   responses remain low, despite efforts to increase participation. Social
   incentives, such as the offer to make a charitable donation on behalf of
   the survey respondent, have generally not been effective where online
   surveys are concerned, but this has not been extensively tested in
   medicine.
   Questions/purposes (1) Do personalized social incentives increase
   response rates or response completeness for postoperative PROM surveys
   in an orthopaedic population? (2) Are there demographic factors
   associated with response and nonresponse to postoperative PROM surveys?
   (3) Are some demographic factors associated with increased response to
   social incentive offers?
   Methods Participants were selected from an institutional orthopaedics
   database. Patients were older than 18 years, had an email address on
   file, and had undergone one of the following procedures 1 to 2 years
   ago: Achilles tendon repair, ACL reconstruction, meniscectomy, hip
   arthroscopy, TKA, or THA. Of 4685 eligible patients, 3000 (64\%) were
   randomly selected for inclusion in the study. Participants were
   randomized to one of four groups: (1) control: no incentive (n = 750);
   (2) patient donation: offer of a USD 5 donation to provide medical
   supplies to a pediatric orthopaedic patient (n = 751); (3) research
   donation: offer of a USD 5 donation to a procedure-specific research
   program (n = 749); or (4) explanation: explanation that response
   supports quality improvement (n = 750). The four groups did not differ
   regarding patient age, gender, race, procedure type, or time since
   procedure. All patients were sent an email invitation with the same PROM
   survey link. The proportion of patients who responded (defined here as
   the response rate) was measured at 4 weeks and compared between
   intervention groups. We used a logistic regression analysis to identify
   demographic factors associated with response while controlling for
   confounding variables and performed subgroup analyses to determine any
   demographic factors associated with increased response to social
   incentives.
   Results There was no difference in the overall response rate (research
   donation: 49\% {[}353 of 725], patient donation: 45\% {[}333 of 734],
   control: 45\% {[}322 of 723], explanation: 44\% {[}314 of 719]; p =
   0.239) or response completeness (research donation: 89\% {[}315 of 353],
   patient donation: 90\% {[}301 of 333], control: 89\% {[}287 of 322],
   explanation: 87\% {[}274 of 314]; p = 0.647) between the four groups.
   Women (odds ratio {[}OR], 1.175; p = 0.042), older patients (< 58 years:
   OR, 1.016 per 1-year increase; p = 0.001; 58-64 years: OR, 1.023 per
   1-year increase; p < 0.001; > 64 years: OR, 1.021 per 1-year increase; p
   < 0.001), and white patients (OR 2.034 compared with black patients, p <
   0.001) were slightly more likely to respond, after controlling for
   potential confounding variables such as gender, age, race, and procedure
   type. In subgroup analyses, men (research donation: 49\% {[}155 of 316],
   patient donation: 45\% {[}146 of 328], control: 40\% {[}130 of 325],
   explanation: 39\% {[}127 of 325]; p = 0.041) and patients younger than
   58 years (research donation: 40\% {[}140 of 351], control: 35\% {[}130
   of 371], patient donation: 32\% {[}113 of 357], explanation: 27\% {[}93
   of 340]; p = 0.004) were slightly more likely to respond to the research
   donation than those with other interventions were.
   Conclusions Despite small effects in specific subgroups, personalized
   social incentives did not increase the overall response to postoperative
   orthopaedic surveys. Novel and targeted strategies will be necessary to
   reach response thresholds that enable healthcare stakeholders to use
   PROMs effectively.}},

Title = {{Association Between Care Management and Outcomes Among Patients With
   Complex Need Medicare Accountable Care Organizations}},
Journal = {{JAMA NETWORK OPEN}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE People with complex needs account for a disproportionate
   amount of Medicare spending, partially because of fragmented care
   delivered across multiple practitioners and settings. Accountable care
   organization (ACO) contracts give practitioners incentives to improve
   care coordination to the extent that coordination initiatives reduce
   total spending or improve quality.
   OBJECTIVE To assess the association between ACO-reported care management
   and coordination activities and quality, utilization, spending, and
   health care system interactions in older adults with complex needs.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this cross-sectional study, survey
   information on care management and coordination processes from 244
   Medicare Shared Savings Program ACOs in the 2017-2018 National Survey of
   ACOs (of 351 Medicare ACO respondents; response rate, 69\%) conducted
   from July 20, 2017, to February 15, 2018, was linked to 2016 Medicare
   administrative claims data. Medicare beneficiaries 66 years or older who
   were defined as having complex needs because of frailty or 2 or more
   chronic conditions associated with high costs and clinical need were
   included.
   EXPOSURES Beneficiary attribution to ACO reporting comprehensive (top
   tertile) care management and coordination activities.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES All-cause prevention quality indicator
   admissions, 30-day all-cause readmissions, acute care and critical
   access hospital admissions, evaluation and management visits in
   ambulatory settings, inpatient days, emergency department visits, total
   spending, post-acute care spending, health care contact days, and
   continuity of care (from Medicare claims).
   RESULTS Among 1402582 Medicare beneficiaries with complex conditions,
   the mean (SD) age was 78 (8.0) years and 55.1\% were female. Compared
   with beneficiaries assigned to ACOs in the bottom tertile of care
   management and coordination activities, those assigned to ACOs in the
   top tertile had identical median prevention quality indicator admissions
   and 30-day all-cause readmissions (0 per beneficiary across all
   tertiles), hospitalization and emergency department visits (1.0 per
   beneficiary in bottom and top tertiles), evaluation and management
   visits in ambulatory settings (14.0 per beneficiary {[}interquartile
   range (IQR), 8.0-21.0] in both tertiles), longer median inpatient days
   (11.0 {[}IQR, 4.0-33.0] vs 10.0 {[}IQR, 4.0-32.0]), higher median annual
   spending (\$14 350 {[}IQR, \$4876-\$36119] vs \$14 229 {[}IQR,
   \$4805-\$36 268]), lower median health care contact days (28.0 {[}IQR,
   17.0-44.0] vs 29.0 {[}IQR, 18.0-45.0]), and lower continuity-of-care
   index (0.12 {[}IQR, 0.08-0.20] vs 0.13 {[}IQR, 0.08-0.21]). Accounting
   for within-patient correlation, quality, utilization, and spending
   outcomes among patients with complex needs attributed to ACOs were not
   statistically different comparing the top vs bottom tertile of care
   management and coordination activities.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The ACO self-reports of care management and
   coordination capacity were not associated with differences in spending
   or measured outcomes for patients with complex needs. Future efforts to
   care for patients with complex needs should assess whether strategies
   found to be effective in other settings are being used, and if so, why
   they fail to meet expectations.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The objective of this study was to determine whether
   community-based pharmacists in North Carolina have the personal
   confidence, comfort level, and resources needed to care appropriately
   for and interact with transgender patients.
   Methods: Using the North Carolina Board of Pharmacy database, a link to
   a 25-item questionnaire was e-mailed to all actively licensed community
   pharmacists in North Carolina. Survey items included pharmacist
   demographics, prior or current education on transgender health care,
   comfort regarding care provision for transgender patients, and the
   ability to care for transgender patients at the practice site.
   Questionnaire items were developed in collaboration with a pharmacist
   who actively participates in the care of transgender patients. The
   questionnaire was pilot-tested among a convenience sample of student
   pharmacists and pharmacists for feedback on validity and question
   structure. The survey was open for 30 days with a reminder sent on day
   15. Upon survey completion, participants had the option to be entered
   into a drawing to receive a gift card incentive.
   Results: In total, 342 surveys were completed of 4784 surveys
   distributed, yielding a 7.1\% response rate. Three percent of survey
   respondents reported receiving education on treating transgender
   patients during their respective pharmacy school curricula, and 12\% of
   respondents sought other forms of transgender education (i.e.,
   continuing education). Seventy-one percent of respondents viewed the
   role of the pharmacist as important in the care of transgender patients.
   Sixty-six percent of respondents were comfortable welcoming transgender
   patients into their practice sites, and 36\% were comfortable asking for
   pronouns.
   Conclusion: Survey participants reported a lack of formal or
   postgraduate education, which describes a need for accessible education
   on transgender care. North Carolina community-based pharmacists believe
   that it is within their role as pharmacists to provide gender-affirming
   care, but they may need additional training to feel comfortable in
   providing this care. (C) 2019 American Pharmacists Association (R).

Abstract = {{This paper introduces an instrumental variables framework for analyzing
   how external factors that affect survey response rates can also affect
   the composition of the sample of respondents. The method may be useful
   for studying survey representativeness, and for assessing the
   effectiveness of some of the conventional corrections for survey
   nonresponse bias.The paper applies the method to data collected in the
   2011 Swiss Electoral Study (SES), in which survey participation
   incentives were randomly assigned across members of the original survey
   sample. The empirical analysis shows that the incentives increased
   response rates substantially. Estimates of a new instrumental variable
   parameter called the Complier Average Survey Response (CASR) suggest
   that the incentives induced participation among people with more
   nationalist political opinions than those who would have participated
   without the incentives. Weighting the respondent data to match the
   covariate distribution in the target population did not account for the
   discrepancy in attitudes between the two groups, suggesting that the
   weights would not succeed in removing nonresponse bias.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORT POLICY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{82-92}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This research examines the behavioural response of commuters within the
   Greater Dublin Area (GDA), Ireland, to a range of policy incentives
   designed to encourage travellers to make greater use of sustainable
   travel modes for work. Several policy measures were evaluated using
   discrete choice and four stage modelling methods, to estimate the
   propensity of commuters to shift to active modes use (walking and
   cycling) rather than single occupancy vehicle (SOV). As a means of
   appraising the hypothetical introduction of a range of active mode
   policy incentives, a stated preference experiment (SP) was created as an
   instrument for gathering decision making, mode choice and
   socio-demographic data from a sample of commuters in the GDA, based on a
   number of designed policy scenarios. ExtenSive transport modelling work
   was subsequently conducted with the National Transport Authority (NTA)
   of Ireland using the National Regional Modelling System (RMS). A
   representation of the policy changes explored in the SP experiment was
   made in this four-stage transport model in order to produce real-life
   estimates of trip making behaviour and mode share, to test the
   behavioural response of the introduction of the policy incentives.
   Changes to parameters in the Mode Choice and Trip Assignment stages of
   the four-stage model were made to account for improvements made to the
   infrastructure and time attributes of walking and cycling in the model.
   The modifications were made based on `Do Nothing/Base', `Do Something',
   and `Do Maximum' scenarios, which were determined by attribute level
   values taken from the SP survey.
   The findings produced in this study show a marked inelasticity of
   commuters to react in response to improvements made to the level of
   service of cycling, while on the contrary exhibiting high levels of
   elasticity to changes made to pedestrian infrastructure. Outputs from
   these model scenarios found that pedestrians in the GDA were most
   sensitive to the policy incentives tested. The results highlight that
   investing in improvements to the public realm may be a more worthwhile
   investment in order to encourage a modal shift to walking for commuting
   trip purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Retaining participants in longitudinal studies is a unique
   methodological challenge in many areas of investigation, and
   specifically for researchers aiming to identify effective interventions
   for women experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV). Individuals in
   abusive relationships are often transient and have logistical,

   natural experiment occurred during a large randomized clinical trial
   enrolling women in abusive relationships who were also heavy drinkers,
   which allowed for the comparison of two incentive methods to promote
   longitudinal retention: cash payment versus reloadable wireless bank
   cards. In all, 600 patients were enrolled in the overall trial, which
   aimed to incentivize participants using a reloadable bank card system to
   promote the completion of 11 weekly interactive voice response system
   (IVRS) phone surveys and 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up phone or in
   person interviews. The first 145 participants were paid with cash as a
   result of logistical delays in setting up the bank card system. At 12
   weeks, participants receiving the bank card incentive completed
   significantly more IVRS phone surveys, odds ratio (OR) = 2.4, 95\%

Abstract = {{Introduction: Web-based epidemiologic surveys are being widely used, but
   still present lower response rates compared to traditional methods.
   Their design can influence survey response rates. Objective: Analyse the
   influence of questionnaire length, frequency of reminders, and the
   interaction between them, on the response rates of five web-based
   questionnaires. Methods: This is a 2x2 factorial study. Participants
   registered into the coortesnaweb platform (n=1,277) were randomly
   assigned to respond to short or long questionnaires, and to receive high
   or low frequency of reminders. We analysed the influence of these
   factors on the response rates of five web-based questionnaires applied
   in a longitudinal manner. The relative risk of responding to an
   additional questionnaire was also analysed. Results: The mean response
   rate was 54.3\%. Sending reminders more frequently was positively
   associated with the response rates for the first questionnaires.
   Questionnaire length did not influence response rates. We found no
   interaction between questionnaire length and frequency of reminders.
   Women and highly educated participants had, respectively, 13.0\% and
   28.0\% increased probability of responding an additional questionnaire.
   Conclusions: We obtained high response rates for the first
   questionnaires. Sending reminders more frequently and providing

Title = {{Resident and program characteristics that impact performance on the
   Ophthalmic Knowledge Assessment Program (OKAP)}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{19}},
Month = {{JUN 7}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundTo determine which resident and program characteristics
   correlate with ophthalmic knowledge, as assessed by resident Ophthalmic
   Knowledge Assessment Program (OKAP) performance.MethodsAn online survey
   was sent in June 2017 to all US ophthalmology residents who took the
   OKAP in April 2017.ResultsThe survey response rate was 13.8\% (192/1387
   residents). The mean respondent age was 30.4years, and 57.3\% were male.
   The mean {[}SD] self-reported 2017 OKAP percentile was 61.9 {[}26.7].
   OKAP performance was found to have a significant positive correlation
   with greater number of hours spent/week studying for the OKAPs
   (p=0.007), with use of online question banks (p<0.001), with review
   sessions and/or lectures arranged by residency programs (p<0.001), and
   with OKAP-specific didactics (p=0.002). On multivariable analysis,
   factors most predictive of residents scoring 75th percentile were,
   higher step 1 scores (OR=2.48, {[}95\% CI: 1.68-3.64, p<0.001]),
   presence of incentives (OR=2.75, {[}95\% CI: 1.16-6.56, p=0.022]),
   greater number of hours/week spent studying (OR=1.09, {[}95\%
   CI:1.01-1.17, p=0.026]) and fewer hours spent in research 3months prior
   to examination (OR=1.08, {[}95\% CI: 1.01-1.15, p=0.020]. Lastly,
   residents less likely to depend on group study sessions as a learning
   method tended to score higher (OR=3.40, {[}95\% CI: 1.16-9.94,
   p=0.026]).ConclusionsPrograms wishing to improve resident OKAP scores
   might consider offering incentives, providing effective access to
   learning content e.g. online question banks, and adjusting the
   curriculum to highlight OKAP material. Step 1 scores may help educators
   identify residents who might be at risk of not performing as well on the
   OKAP.}},

   involved in selecting the sample of households or respondents for the

Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{100}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Understanding how metapopulations persist in dynamic working landscapes
   requires assessing the behaviors of key actors that change patches as
   well as intrinsic factors driving turnover. Coupled human and natural
   systems (CHANS) research uses a multidisciplinary approach to identify
   the key actors, processes, and feedbacks that drive metapopulation and
   landscape dynamics. We describe a framework for modeling metapopulations
   in CHANS that integrates ecological and social data by coupling
   stochastic patch occupancy models of metapopulation dynamics with
   agent-based models of land-use change. We then apply this framework to
   metapopulations of the threatened black rail (Laterallus jamaicensis)
   and widespread Virginia rail (Rallus limicola) that inhabit patchy,
   irrigation-fed wetlands in the rangelands of the California Sierra
   Nevada foothills. We collected data from five diverse sources (rail
   occupancy surveys, land-use change mapping, a survey of landowner
   decision making, climate and reservoir databases, and mosquito trapping
   and West Nile virus testing) and integrated them into an agent-based
   stochastic patch occupancy model. We used the model to (1) quantify the
   drivers of metapopulation dynamics, and the potential interactions and
   feedbacks among them; (2) test predictions of the behavior of
   metapopulations in dynamic working landscapes; and (3) evaluate the
   impact of three policy options on metapopulation persistence (irrigation
   district water cutbacks during drought, incentives for landowners to
   create wetlands, and incentives for landowners to protect wetlands).
   Complex metapopulation dynamics emerged when landscapes functioned as
   CHANS, highlighting the importance of integrating human activities and
   other ecological processes into metapopulation models. Rail
   metapopulations were strongly top-down regulated by precipitation, and
   the black rail's decade-long decline was caused by the combination of
   West Nile virus and drought. Theoretical predictions of the two
   metapopulations' responses to dynamic landscapes and incentive programs
   were complicated by heterogeneity in patch quality and CHANS couplings,
   respectively. Irrigation cutbacks during drought posed a serious
   extinction risk that neither incentive policy effectively ameliorated.}},

Abstract = {{Employee energy benefits (EEBs), such as subsidies for employee home
   energy audits and financial incentives for carpooling to work, aim to
   influence employees' environmental behaviors outside of work. Exploring
   these understudied benefits would offer new insights that can enrich
   theories of employer and employee motivations for engaging in
   environmental behavior, as well as reveal new strategies for making
   significant progress on environment goals. By drawing upon employer
   reports and conducting a survey of 482 US adults employed full-time, we
   found that there are a wide range of types of EEBs currently offered by
   employers, and furthermore, they were more likely to be offered in
   certain industries, such as state and local governments but not others
   such as retail. These benefits were offered to 17\% of employees and
   included a vast array of strategies and approaches. Guided by theorizing
   on employer and employee motivation, open-ended responses suggested
   employers were perceived to offer EEBs to maximize competiveness and
   because of social responsibility concerns, and employees tended to
   enroll because they wanted to save money and time or because they cared
   about the environment. Finally, EEBs were linked to employee
   environmental behavior and morale. The findings reveal new information
   about the types of EEBs being offered, motivations for offering and
   enrolling in EEBs, and their relationship to employee behavior and
   morale. This work suggests numerous lines of promising new research.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This article investigates how parties respond to polling results on the

   information can be used to refine campaign strategies. Parties
   underperforming in the polls have incentives to emphasize their own
   policy positions and to attack other parties. These arguments are
   supported by evidence from 2140 campaign statements by Portuguese party
   leaders over two elections, combined with polling results. The findings
   suggest that parties carefully adjust their campaign rhetoric in
   response to public opinion signals. The study contributes to research on

Abstract = {{Objectives Community pharmacists dispensed 68.4\% of all drugs used in
   Korea, but reported only 2.0\% of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in 2011.
   This study compared community pharmacists' understanding of the
   importance of ADR management and their actual practice of it, and
   identified relevant factors related to their management of ADR. Methods
   With the use of a modified health belief model (HBM), 800 community
   pharmacists were surveyed via social network service messaging. A total
   of 200 usable responses were obtained for an effective response rate of
   25.0\%. Descriptive analysis was used to quantify the differences
   between community pharmacists' understanding of the importance of ADR
   prevention and their practice. A hierarchical regression was performed
   with the following predictors: (1) demographic factors, (2) social
   impact of ADR prevention, (3) importance of social support, and (4)
   cognition about the importance of ADR prevention. Results Although
   community pharmacists clearly recognized the importance of ADR
   management, their performance was very low. The disparity between
   cognition and performance was more pronounced for ADR reporting than for
   patient counseling. Social support was the most powerful predictor of
   ADR prevention practice, explaining 18.5\% of the variance in ADR
   prevention practice. Social impact of ADR prevention, demographic
   factors, and cognition about the importance of ADR prevention explained
   12.6\%, 6.2\%, and 1.8\% of the variance, respectively. Conclusions
   Strengthening community pharmacists' performance of population-based ADR
   management should be prioritized over patient-oriented ADR management.
   To improve public health, community pharmacists should make an effort at
   ADR reporting. This can be done with appropriate government support,
   such as incentives to community pharmacists, public awareness campaigns,
   education, and establishment of feedback systems.}},

Volume = {{17}},

Pages = {{145-169}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes and tests a better-defined interpretation of the
   different responses of gasoline demand to tax changes and to
   market-related price changes. Namely, the signaling effect of gasoline
   taxes is one that impacts on long-run consumer decisions in addition to
   the incentives provided by tax-inclusive gasoline prices. Our hypothesis
   is tested using a complete demand system augmented with information on
   gasoline taxes and fitted to household-level data from the 2006 to 2013
   rounds of the US Consumer Expenditure survey. Information on gasoline
   taxes is found to be a significant determinant of household demand
   additional to tax-inclusive gasoline prices. The equity implications are
   examined by contrasting the incidence across income distribution of a
   simulated \$0.22/gallon tax increase to that of a market-related price
   increase equal in size. The tax increase is clearly regressive, slightly
   more than the market-related price increase. However, regressivity is by
   no means a reason to give up gasoline taxes as an instrument for
   reducing gasoline consumption externalities. Their high effectiveness in
   reducing gasoline demand implies that small tax increases can
   substantially improve the environment while minimizing the related
   distributional effects. Also, gasoline taxes generate revenue that can
   be used to offset their regressivity.}},

Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{MAY 2}},
Abstract = {{Electric vehicles (EVs) can be regarded as a kind of demand response
   (DR) resource. Nevertheless, the EVs travel behavior is flexible and
   random, in addition, their willingness to participate in the DR event is
   uncertain, they are expected to be managed and utilized by the EV
   aggregator (EVA). In this perspective, this paper presents a composite
   methodology that take into account the dynamic road network (DRN)
   information and fuzzy user participation (FUP) for obtaining
   spatio-temporal projections of demand response potential from electric
   vehicles and the electric vehicle aggregator. A dynamic traffic network
   model taking over the traffic time-varying information is developed by
   graph theory. The trip chain based on housing travel survey is set up,
   where Dijkstra algorithm is employed to plan the optimal route of EVs,
   in order to find the travel distance and travel time of each trip of
   EVs. To demonstrate the uncertainties of the EVs travel pattern,
   simulation analysis is conducted using Monte Carlo method. Subsequently,
   we suggest a fuzzy logic-based approach to uncertainty analysis that
   starts with investigating EV users' subjective ability to participate in
   DR event, and we develop the FUP response mechanism which is constructed
   by three factors including the remaining dwell time, remaining SOC, and
   incentive electricity pricing. The FUP is used to calculate the
   real-time participation level of a single EV. Finally, we take advantage
   of a simulation example with a coupled 25-node road network and 54-node
   power distribution system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed method.}},

   Incentive Scheme? A Stated Preference Approach}},
Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{MAY 2}},
Abstract = {{In South Korea, renewable energy policy is mainly focused on electricity
   and tends to neglect renewable heat (RH). However, for the purpose of
   reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the heating sector must sharply
   switch from its use of conventional fuels to renewable sources. The
   South Korean Government is considering an RH incentive (RHI) program
   with financial and policy support schemes and is thus demanding
   information about residential consumers' acceptance of the RHI program
   to expand the use of RH. Therefore, this study looked into residential
   consumers' acceptance of the introduction of the RHI program by applying
   contingent valuation (CV). For this purpose, a CV survey of 600
   interviewees was conducted using a dichotomous choice question format
   that asked a respondent if she/he is willing to pay a given amount.
   Furthermore, among the various dichotomous choice question formats, the
   one-and-one-half-bounded format, which is considered desirable in terms
   of efficiency as well as consistency, was applied. One point to note in
   analyzing the CV responses was that not a few interviewees had zero
   willingness to pay (WTP). Thus, a spike model was employed to deal with
   the dichotomous choice CV data with a number of zero observations. The
   results revealed that the household mean WTP amounted to KRW 5753 (USD
   5.35) per year. If we look at this value from a national perspective, it
   is worth KRW 113.63 billion (USD 105.61 million) per year. This value
   corresponds to the economic value or benefits that the introduction of
   an RHI program provides to the South Korean people each year and needs
   to be compared to the costs that the introduction of RHI will incur.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   To measure community-based preceptors' overall satisfaction and
   motivations, the influence of students on preceptors' practices, and
   compare with 2005 and 2011 studies.
   Method
   North Carolina primary care preceptors across disciplines (physicians,
   pharmacists, advanced practice nurses, physician assistants) received
   survey invitations via e-mail, fax, postcard, and/or full paper survey.
   Most questions in 2017 were the same as questions used in prior years,
   including satisfaction with precepting, likelihood to continue
   precepting, perceived influence of teaching students in their practice,
   and incentives for precepting. A brief survey or phone interview was
   conducted with 62 nonresponders. Chi-square tests were used to examine
   differences across discipline groups and to compare group responses over
   time.
   Results
   Of the 2,786 preceptors contacted, 893 (32.1\%) completed
   questionnaires. Satisfaction (816/890; 91.7\%) and likelihood of
   continuing to precept (778/890; 87.4\%) remained unchanged from 2005 and
   2011. However, more preceptors reported a negative influence for patient
   flow (422/888; 47.5\%) in 2017 than in 2011 (452/1,266; 35.7\%) and 2005
   (496/1,379; 36.0\%) (P < .0001), and work hours (392/889; 44.1\%) in
   2017 than in 2011 (416/1,268; 32.8\%) and 2005 (463/1,392; 33.3\%) (P <
   .0001). Importance of receiving payment for teaching increased from
   32.2\% (371/1,152) in 2011 to 46.4\% (366/789) in 2017 (P< .0001).

   This 2017 survey suggests preceptor satisfaction and likelihood to
   continue precepting have remained unchanged from prior years. However,
   increased reporting of negative influence of students on practice and
   growing value of receiving payment highlight growing concerns about
   preceptors' time and finances and present a call to action.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) were introduced by the European
   Union as a transparency tool in order to meet the targets of reducing
   the energy consumption of buildings. However, several inefficiencies
   hindered their implementation, resulting in a recast of the
   corresponding Directive coming into force in Germany in 2014. In 2012,
   Amecke (2012) was predicting that a ``fundamental change{''} would occur
   due to the upcoming improvement of EPCs' legal status. This follow-up
   investigation proves Amecke's assumption and expands the examination by
   comparing different target groups (tenants vs. owners) and elicitation
   methods (indirect approach via choice-based conjoint analysis vs. direct
   approach via self-explicated method). We analyzed the survey responses
   of 206 participants (108 tenants, 98 owners), which had been collected
   between May and July 2017. The results of the indirect approach suggest
   an ongoing change in the housing market, as energy efficiency achieves a
   high importance score similar to that of rent resp. price and of
   location. Owners are significantly more familiar with the EPC tool,
   giving it stronger consideration than tenants do. The results indicate
   three main policy implications concerning enhanced (i) transparency
   regulation and its compliance, (ii) environmental awareness, and (iii)
   communication of economic incentives.}},

Volume = {{216}},
Pages = {{361-372}},
Month = {{APR 10}},
Abstract = {{To reduce energy consumption and environmental pollution, the Chinese
   government is vigorously promoting the adoption of electric vehicles
   (EVs). As one of the first demonstration and promotion cities for EVs in
   China, Beijing has played an important leading role in the promotion of
   EVs. Based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB), this study
   introduced consumer cognitive status, product perception, and incentive
   policy measures (non-monetary incentive policy measures and monetary
   incentive policy measures) to build a purchase intention influence
   mechanism model for EVs. A questionnaire survey was conducted from March
   to April of 2018 among potential consumers in Beijing. A total of 502
   valid survey responses were obtained, and a structural equation model
   (SEM) was used for an empirical analysis of the factors influencing EV
   purchasing intention. The results show that attitude, perceived behavior
   control, cognitive status, product perception and monetary incentive
   policy measures have significant positive effects on consumers'
   intentions to purchase EVs in Beijing. However, subjective norms and non
   monetary incentive policy measures have no significant impact on
   purchasing intention. In addition, the analysis results of the
   multi-group SEM show that there are significant differences in
   demographic variables (gender, age, education level, income, and
   ownership of cars) in the path of consumer purchase intention.
   Implications for policy makers and scope for further research are

Title = {{Knowledge of Hearing Loss among University Students Pursuing Careers in
   Health Care}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF AUDIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{273-281}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Background: Albeit limited, research suggests that students pursuing
   careers in health care receive limited training on the provision of
   services for people with hearing loss. As the incidence of hearing loss
   continues to increase among Americans, it is critical that medical
   professionals understand how hearing loss among patients may affect the
   manner in which they can provide services most effectively.
   Purpose: The aim of this project is to assess the amount of experience
   and confidence that preprofessional health-care students at one
   university obtain during the course of their training and whether these
   students would be interested in additional information related to
   hearing health.
   Research Design: Preprofessional health-care students in terminal degree
   programs at one university completed a survey regarding the provision of
   services for individuals with hearing loss. Students were asked to
   quantify their prior training on topics related to hearing loss, report
   their perceptions of the benefits and barriers to screening hearing, and
   report their self-efficacy in providing services for individuals with
   hearing loss. Additional survey items investigated students' interest in
   receiving further training on these topics.
   Study Sample: Participants (n = 95; 16.2\% response rate) were students
   at a mid-sized, Midwestern university who were pursuing the following
   terminal degrees: medicine, physician assistant, nursing, pharmacy,
   physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology, and
   respiratory therapy (bachelor's degree in respiratory care).
   Participants were selected based on membership in an interdisciplinary
   education training program. All students in this program received an
   invitation to participate in the study. Of the participants, 68 (71.6\%)
   were Caucasian and 86 (90.5\%) were female.
   Data Collection and Analysis: A 28-item online survey on various topics
   related to hearing loss was used to document student responses. All
   students enrolled in a university's interdisciplinary professional
   education course (n = 586) received an online link to the survey via an
   initial email, which contained a brief introduction to the study, the
   assurance of response anonymity, and a statement regarding implied
   consent. A second email was sent to students, which reminded
   participants of the request to complete the survey.
   Results: Overall, 60\% of participants reported an interest in receiving
   additional information on hearing health and 66.3\% of respondents
   indicated that they wished to receive training via an in-service or
   internet workshop facilitated by their university program. Most of the
   participants reported that they had not received training and did not
   feel confident identifying the signs and symptoms of hearing loss and
   making an appropriate referral, which led to the request for additional
   information.
   Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that preprofessional
   health-care students have an interest in receiving additional education
   on various topics related to hearing loss including a better
   understanding of how hearing loss impacts the quality of life in
   affected individuals. These findings provide an incentive to provide
   additional training related to hearing loss identification and
   management for preprofessional health-care students to foster increased
   competency and improved patient care.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: In recent years, researchers have been working towards
   creating a standard conceptual framework of food parenting. To
   understand how parents' reports correspond with the proposed model, the
   current study examined parents' reports of their feeding behaviours in
   the context of a newly established framework of food parenting.
   DESIGN: Cross-sectional, with a two-week follow-up for a subset of the
   sample. Participants completed a quantitative and qualitative survey to
   assess food parenting. The survey included items from common food
   parenting instruments to measure the constructs posited in the
   framework. Exploratory factor analyses were conducted to ascertain which
   items related most closely to one another and factors were mapped on to
   existing constructs.
   SETTING: Online.ParticipantsParents of children aged 2.5-7 years (n
   496). Of these, 122 completed a two-week follow-up.
   RESULTS: Analyses revealed eleven aspects of Structure (monitoring;
   distraction; family presence; meal/snack schedule; unstructured
   practices; healthy/unhealthy food availability; food preparation;
   healthy/unhealthy modelling; rules), ten aspects of Coercive Control
   (pressure to eat; using food to control emotions; food incentives to
   eat; food incentives to behave; non-food incentives to eat; restriction
   for health/weight; covert restriction; clean plate; harsh coercion) and
   seven aspects of Autonomy Promotion (praise; encouragement; nutrition
   education; child involvement; negotiation; responsive feeding; repeated
   offering). Content validity, assessed via parents' open-ended
   explanations of their responses, was high, and test-retest reliability
   was moderate to high. Structure and Autonomy Promoting food parenting
   were highly positively correlated.
   CONCLUSIONS: In general, parents' responses provided support for the
   model, but suggested some amendments and refinements.}},

Abstract = {{There is a substantial literature estimating the responsiveness of
   charitable donations to tax incentives for giving in the USA. One
   approach estimates the price elasticity of giving based on tax return
   data of individuals who itemize their deductions, a group substantially
   wealthier than the average taxpayer. Another estimates the price
   elasticity for the average taxpayer based on general population survey
   data. Broadly, results from both arms of the literature present a
   counterintuitive conclusion: the price elasticity of donations of the
   average taxpayer is larger than that of the average, wealthier,
   itemizer. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that this
   conclusion results from a heretofore unrecognized downward bias in the
   estimator of the price elasticity of giving when non-itemizers are
   included in the estimation sample (generally with survey data). An
   intuitive modification to the standard model used in the literature is
   shown to yield a consistent and more efficient estimator of the price
   elasticity for the average taxpayer under a testable restriction. Strong
   empirical support is found for this restriction, and we estimate a bias
   in the price elasticity around -1, suggesting the existing literature
   significantly over-estimates (in absolute value) the price elasticity of
   giving. Our results provide evidence of an inelastic price elasticity
   for the average taxpayer, with a statistically significant and elastic
   price response found only for households in the top decile of income.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: This study evaluates the effect of program and incentive
   characteristics on satisfaction with incentives and perceived impact of
   incentives on behavior change among Medicaid beneficiaries who
   participated in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Medicaid
   Incentives for Prevention of Chronic Diseases program.
   Methods: In 2014-2015, an English- and Spanish-language survey was
   administered to Medicaid Incentives for Prevention of Chronic Diseases
   program participants about their satisfaction with incentives and
   perceived impact of incentives. Completed surveys were received from
   2,276 eligible sample members (response rate=52.7\%). In 2016-2017,
   multilevel, multivariable, ordinal logistic regression models were
   performed to examine program characteristics that predict outcomes,
   while controlling for respondent characteristics.
   Results: Medicaid Incentives for Prevention of Chronic Diseases
   participants were satisfied with program incentives. Most survey
   respondents strongly agreed that they liked getting incentives for
   taking care of their health (78\%), they were happy with the incentives
   overall (75\%), the incentives were fair (73\%), and they liked how
   often they received incentives (67\%). Participants in programs
   delivered by telephone reported higher satisfaction with incentives
   compared with those in programs delivered in person. However,
   participants in programs delivered both in person and by telephone were
   more likely to perceive a positive impact of incentives. Incentive form
   was a significant predictor of satisfaction with incentives but not of
   incentive impact. Dollar amount of incentives influenced satisfaction
   with incentives and impact of incentives.
   Conclusions: Program delivery method, incentive form, and incentive
   magnitude are important characteristics to consider when designing
   incentive programs. Incentive programs can consider providing modest
   incentive amounts to achieve self-reported impact on behavior change.

Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {{101-107}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Aim: International guidelines highlight the importance of implementation
   supports and quality monitoring of multidisciplinary care for breast
   cancer. In Canada, Ontario has standards for formal multidisciplinary
   cancer conferences (MCCs), but other provinces/territories do not. This
   study aimed to stocktake MCCs for breast cancer in Canadian sites
   participating in the RUBY cohort study (Reducing the Burden of Breast
   Cancer in Young Women) to better understand variations in
   multidisciplinary care across Canada and to add to the international
   literature.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with surgeons and
   surgical oncologists representing 34 clinical centres participating in
   RUBY. Questions were grouped according to: type of multidisciplinary
   care, implementation, function, practice, participation and
   presentation, operation, and demographics, and included a mix of
   Likert-based, tick box and open-ended questions.
   Results: Twenty-two responses (65\%) were received. 91\% of respondents
   reported that formal MCCs are part of regular practice. However,
   variation exists in the supports in place for ongoing implementation of
   MCCs, the understanding of the functions of MCCs, and the patients
   presented for discussion. Results also suggest less formalized processes
   for MCC in provinces without practice standards.
   Conclusions: Response differences between Ontario and elsewhere suggest
   that standards for MCC and supports for their implementation make a
   positive difference in their operation. However, ongoing operational
   challenges and issues with attendance exist for all sites and suggest
   that along with development of practice standards, incentives for
   participation and further education on benefits and function of MCC may
   support uptake of MCCs in clinical practice. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Purpose Drawing on a sample of 520 negative reviews posted on
   TripAdvisor against all five-star hotels operating in Petra, Jordan, the
   purpose of this paper is to evaluate the response of luxury hotels to
   negative online reviews by considering the Response Rate (RR), the
   Response Time (RT) and the Response Content (RC).
   Design/methodology/approach A deductive content analysis was used on
   hotels' managerial responses. Based on the literature review, a
   four-construct scheme was identified to guide the analysis including
   Appreciation; Apology; Explanation; and Incentive. The managerial
   responses were carefully read and manually coded based on the
   four-construct scheme. The time between the review posting date and the
   date of the managerial response was also recorded. Luxury hotel managers
   were also surveyed to obtain insights into their perceptions and
   practices with respect to online reputation management. Findings The
   findings call into question luxury hotels' awareness of the harmful
   impact of negative online reviews. Specifically, the findings suggest
   that less than half of the negative reviews received a managerial
   response, and that more than half of these were standardized and did not
   refer to the issues raised in the reviews. The low response rate coupled
   with the hotel managers' consensus on the importance of answering all
   online reviews indicates inconsistency between hotel managers'
   perceptions and practices with regard to online reputation management.
   Originality/value The paper adds to the ongoing debate on reputation
   management in the hospitality industry by considering the managerial
   response to negative online reviews. The paper discusses several
   managerial implications for hotel managers as well as avenues for future
   research.}},

   working outside of metropolitan areas and greater workforce diversity,
   along with increased incentive, supervision and inter-professional
   support for new graduate and early career clinicians considering working
   outside of hospital settings. To ensure evidence-based practice, further
   research into the validity of current assessment and intervention
   methods used across aged care settings is needed. Conclusion: The
   findings highlight the need for an extended scope of practice and
   improved models of support for speech-language pathologists working with
   older people to better respond to the needs of an ageing population and
   on-going aged care sector reform.}},

Abstract = {{As peak demand for electricity continues to rise, distributors have
   begun charging small and medium-sized users for their short term demand
   rather than just their energy use. This is not only to meet the
   political aspirations for increased demand-side flexibility that now
   exist in many corners of the world, but to make sure that users are
   charged for the costs they incur. As it is only until recently that this
   type of users have come to face demand charges, there are however very
   few studies on what the actual effects of such pricing policies are, and
   those studies that do exist suffer from different methodological
   shortcomings that reduce their validity as a basis for real-world policy
   evaluations. This study provides the first state-of-the-art causal
   analysis of the demand response effects of a billing demand charge
   involuntarily introduced to small and medium sized users (35-63 A),
   using novel two-level time series models on retrospective observational
   consumption and survey data. Our analyses suggest that the tariff has
   induced an average response of -0.32 kWh/day per user over a two year
   long posttreatment period in comparison to a matched control group,
   equal to 7.4\% of their daily average use during the pretreatment
   period. The response seems to have increased over time and to be greater
   during wintertime: around -0.70 kWh/day or 16.2\% of the treated users'
   average daily use during the pretreatment period. Comparing the
   individual users' response to the size of their financial incentive to
   respond given the new tariff as well as their self-reported perception
   of the relative importance of electricity expenditures, we did not find
   any support for the common assumption that users with a higher financial
   incentive to respond do so to a greater extent. This might suggest that
   small and medium-sized commercial users, just as residential users, may
   exhibit non-financial drivers and barriers for engaging in demand
   response that may be vital to understand as policy makers and industry
   continue to seek increased demand-side flexibility.}},

   Measurements Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic
   regression examined clinician characteristics, prescribing practices and
   primary barriers and incentives to prescribing buprenorphine or
   prescribing at or near the authorized patient limit. Findings Among
   respondents, 75.5\% had prescribed buprenorphine since obtaining a DATA
   waiver; the mean (standard deviation) number of patients treated in the
   past month was 26.6 (40.3), and 13.1\% of providers were prescribing at
   or near their patient limit in the past month. Lack of patient demand,
   cited by 19.4\% of clinicians, was the most common primary barrier to
   prescribing buprenorphine or prescribing to the authorized patient
   limit, followed by time constraints in practice (14.6\%) and insurance
   reimbursement, prior authorization or other insurance requirements

Abstract = {{Industrial equipment such as ruggedized handheld computers, scanners,
   and label printers used within asset tracking environments are expensive
   to purchase and costly to repair. For organizations that use this
   equipment, there is value in understanding when and why damage occurs

   pride. Given the connection between psychological ownership and pride,
   the purpose of this study was to analyze employee surveys to determine
   what methods, tools, or programs could reduce repair and replacement
   while developing a stronger sense of ownership for ruggedized devices
   used in material-handling industries by shift workers. Unstructured
   interviews about device repair with management from a large industrial
   company were utilized to create a multiple-choice, anonymous online
   survey (n = 353). Of the six interventions proposed, assigning the same
   device to the same employee every shift appeared to have the most
   consistent and positive response. Destruction rates and costs should be
   posted for employee viewing and managers of workgroups with consistently
   high destruction rates should receive additional training. An
   incentive-based program for employees responsible for the least amount
   of device damage as well as an individual-assignment of devices to
   employees may be considered. Applications for this student include

Abstract = {{Due to the scarcity of land for urban development, Brownfield
   Redevelopment (BR) is considered a sustainable urban land tool in
   developed countries, but its adoption in developing countries remains in
   its infancy. Barriers impeding BR need to be investigated in detail.
   However, few studies have analyzed barriers to BR in developing
   countries. This study aims to analyze the critical barriers to BR in
   Pakistan by using a two-stage methodology including the Fuzzy Delphi
   Method (FDM) and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Initially, 41
   barriers were identified through a comprehensive literature review. FDM
   screened out 33 barriers through expert opinion. Survey questionnaires
   were sent to major stakeholders involved in the BR process. Finally,
   valid responses were analyzed using SEM to verify and rank the most
   critical barriers. Study results indicated 26 critical barriers. The top
   five critical barriers were lack of policy incentives, the complexity of
   public-private partnerships, lack of professional and technical
   personnel, the conflict between stakeholders, and lack of awareness of
   environmental law. A comparative analysis of barriers to BR in Pakistan
   and other countries including the USA, Canada, the UK, Germany, and
   China showed that critical barriers vary by country. Furthermore, factor
   analysis results extracted five major categories for 26 critical
   barriers, including political and legal barriers, financial and economic
   barriers, technical and operational barriers, management system
   barriers, and environmental barriers. The most dominant barrier category
   was technical and operational barriers, impeding BR in Pakistan. This
   study creates value in the BR literature by identifying the most
   critical barriers to BR in a developing country. It could support
   practitioners and land use policy makers in developing appropriate
   strategies to promote BR. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{What impact have government policies had on the private sector's

   role of cartels in organizing responses to crises. The case study is
   based on a survey of the cartel agreements and investigates why cartels
   provided solutions only to short-term crises, if they provided solutions
   at all. The hypothesis is that government policies played a substantial
   part in the story, as they did not provide enough incentives for
   coordinated responses to structural change. The years 1919 to 1949
   encompass the crises caused by the territorial and political change in

Volume = {{132}},
Pages = {{1216-1229}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents and evaluates a novel demand response method for
   households, designed for mitigating intermittency in smart grids with a
   high share of renewables. The method, named Dynamic Active Demand
   Response (DADR), is based on an innovative paradigm of offering multiple
   electricity service levels and a dynamic-active demand response scheme.
   It provides the grid operator with the ability to influence consumption
   patterns in real time, so that responding to renewables intermittency is
   more effective in terms of reliability, predictability and response
   time.
   DADR's performance is evaluated using a Monte Carlo simulation model,
   which assesses the method's intermittency mitigation potential and
   estimates the expected economic value of implementing it in the Israeli
   residential sector. Major components of the model are based on a survey,
   conducted among Israeli households. The survey results indicate that,
   given a sufficiently attractive economic incentive, participation rates
   can reach as high as 85-90\%. The Monte Carlo simulation results reveal
   that DADR can make a significant contribution to mitigating renewables
   intermittency, with energy savings of hundreds to thousands of MWh a day
   and a positive net economic benefit. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This is Part 2 of a two-part study that explores latent demand for three
   types of zero-emissions vehicles (ZEVs): plug-in hybrid electric
   vehicles (PHEVs), battery electric vehicles (BEVs), and hydrogen fuel
   cell vehicles (HFCVs). Using an in-depth, Reflexive Participant approach
   to data collection, our survey instrument includes two measures of
   latent demand implemented with a representative sample of 2123 new
   vehicle-buying households in Canada in 2017. While Part 1 (Long et al.,
   this issue) reports on a design space exercise, here we summarize
   results from a stated choice experiment, using a latent class choice
   model to quantify respondent preferences and motivations, and the
   heterogeneity therein. We identify five unique respondent classes (or
   segments) that largely differ by their preferred drivetrain, only three
   of which demonstrate significant interest in ZEVs: PEV-enthusiast
   (representing 13\% of the sample), PHEV-oriented (22\%), and ZEV-neutral
   (21\%). Respondents in all three classes tend to have higher levels of
   environmental concern or engagement in an environment-oriented
   lifestyle. All classes significantly value purchase price and
   incentives, but vary widely in valuation of fuel savings, charging
   access, and refueling access - with little overall valuation of driving
   range and public charging access. We calculate conditional choice
   probabilities as estimates of ZEV latent demand, which is equivalent to
   29\% of new market share under base conditions, and significantly
   increases to a high of 49\% with purchase incentives and widespread
   charger deployment. Our discussion compares insights provided by the two
   stated response approaches to latent demand (in Parts 1 and 2), making a
   case for overall complementarity.}},

   incentive significantly increased response rates with farmers but there
   was no significant effect of when the incentive was distributed.
   Additionally, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of using the

   Secondary Mathematics Teachers Prepared for High-Need Schools}},
Journal = {{TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{121}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background: School leaders are challenged by the relatively limited
   supply and high turnover of qualified secondary school mathematics
   teachers. In response, policy makers and teacher educators have
   developed various pathways and incentives to recruit, train, place, and
   support highly qualified mathematics teachers to work in hard-to-staff
   schools.
   Focus of Study: In this study, we investigate the recruitment,
   placement, and early career trajectories of 158 Grades 6-12 mathematics
   teachers from two preparation programs focused on staffing
   ``high-need{''} schools in the same region.
   Setting: The contrasting programs were both supported by the same
   university in the Northeast United States.
   Participants \& Programs: The participants were 158 secondary school
   (Grades 6-12) mathematics teachers. Of these, 48 were recruited and
   prepared through a teacher education program with financial support from
   the National Science Foundation-funded Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship
   Program. The other 110 school mathematics teachers were recruited and
   trained through the Greater Boston office of Teach For America. Both
   programs required two years of service in high-need schools.
   Research Design: In this study, we used a comparative design.
   Descriptive profiles of teachers from each program were created. Then,
   participants' early career trajectories were compared using logistic
   regression and survival analysis.
   Data Collection and Analysis: We administered a longitudinal survey and
   created a database combining survey data and each program's
   administrative data.
   Conclusions: Our data illustrate that the Noyce scholarship-supported
   pathway was generally successful in recruiting individuals with STEM
   majors, training them to be mathematics teachers, and placing those
   individuals as secondary school mathematics teachers in high-need
   schools. The comparison of the scholarship-pathway teachers with the
   secondary school mathematics teachers in the alternative-certification
   pathway provides a useful contrast. On the one hand, the alternatively
   certified secondary school mathematics teachers were less likely than
   the scholarship-pathway teachers to have STEM majors, and the attrition
   rate for the alternatively prepared teachers was higher than the
   attrition rate for the scholarship-supported teachers, particularly
   after they had completed the two-year service requirement. On the other
   hand, the alternative-certification program recruited a more diverse
   pool of potential teachers and placed these teachers in schools serving
   a higher proportion of low-SES students.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES: To understand physician organization (PO) responses to
   financial incentives for quality and total cost of care among POs that
   were exposed to a statewide multipayer value-based payment (VBP)
   program, and to identify challenges that POs face in advancing the goats
   of VBP.
   STUDY DESIGN: Semistructured qualitative interviews and survey.
   METHODS: We drew a stratified random sample of 40 multispecialty
   California POs (25\% of the POs that were eligible for incentives).
   In-person interviews were conducted with physician leaders and a survey
   was administered on actions being taken to reduce costs and redesign
   care and to discuss the challenges to improving value. We performed a
   thematic analysis of interview transcripts to identify common actions
   taken and challenges to reducing costs.
   RESULTS: VBP helps to promote care delivery transformation among POs,
   although efforts varied across organizations. Investments are occurring
   primarily in strategies to control hospital costs and redesign primary
   care, particularly for chronically ill patients; specialty care redesign
   is largely absent. Physician payment incentives for value remain small
   relative to total compensation, with continued emphasis on productivity.
   Challenges cited include the lack of a single enterprisewide electronic
   health records platform for information exchange, limited ability to
   influence specialists who were not exclusive to the organization, tack
   of payer cost and utilization data to manage costs, inability to recoup
   care redesign investments given the small size of VBP incentives, and
   tack of physician cost awareness.
   CONCLUSIONS: Transformation could be advanced by strengthening financial
   incentives for value; engaging specialists in care redesign and
   delivering value; enhancing partnerships among POs, hospitals, and
   payers to align quality and cost actions; strengthening information
   exchange across providers; and applying other strategies to influence
   physician behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Background HIV prevention research often involves the use of online
   surveys as data collection instruments. Incomplete responses to these
   surveys can introduce bias. We aimed to develop and assess innovative
   methods to incentivise respondents to complete surveys. Methods Adult
   men who have sex with men (MSM) living in the USA were recruited through
   banner advertisements on Facebook from 27 April 2015 to 6 May 2015 to
   participate in an online survey about HIV prevention and risk
   behaviours. Participants were randomised to one of four conditions: a
   monetary incentive; a series of altruistic messages highlighting the
   importance of participating in research; access to a dashboard comparing
   their responses with statistics from other participants after
   completion; and no incentive. Kaplan-Meier survival methods and
   univariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate survey
   dropout by incentive group and demographic variables of interest.
   Results There were a total of 1178 participants randomised to the four
   treatment groups. The rate of survey dropout among participants in the
   altruistic (HR=0.68, 95\% CI 0.49 to 0.93), monetary (HR=0.44, 95\% CI
   0.32 to 0.61) and dashboard (HR=0.78, 95\% CI 0.58 to 1.06) groups was
   lower than the non-incentivised control group. Regardless of condition,
   survey dropout was also lower among MSM aged 28-34 (HR=0.67, 95\% CI
   0.50 to 0.90) compared with those aged 18-22 years old, and MSM who were
   white (HR=0.78, 95\% CI 0.60 to 1.02) compared with non-white
   participants. Conclusion Monetary incentives and altruistic messaging
   can improve survey completion in online behavioural HIV prevention
   research among MS}},

Title = {{Underwater noise noise abatement: Economic factors and policy options}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{92}},
Pages = {{116-123}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Underwater noise pollution is becoming globally recognised as a
   significant threat to aquatic ecosystems and the resources they provide.
   The effects of noise pollution extend from blue whales to zooplankton,
   impacting threatened species and affecting key industries including
   fisheries and ecotourism. In response, policymakers in some
   jurisdictions have made substantive high-level commitments to address
   noise pollution, however the implementation of noise reduction measures
   (noise abatement) remains limited. To support the development of
   effective noise management policies, this paper explores the economic
   and policy context to noise abatement in three major noise-generating
   industries: shipping, offshore windfarm construction, and seismic
   surveying for oil and gas. In each case, tractable policy options are
   identified which make considered use of command-and-control and
   incentive-based measures in light of the available noise abatement
   methods. Drawing on instructive examples from terrestrial noise
   management and other sectors, it is concluded that such measures offer
   the most promising long-term solution to deliver existing and future
   policy commitments to manage cumulative levels of underwater noise
   pollution.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Establishing what leads people to particular moral beliefs is
   complicated by potential predictors being themselves caused by moral
   attitudes. This problem is less acute when considering the effects of

   Better-looking respondents give more morally permissive responses to
   most questions relating to sex. For issues not directly related to
   sexual opportunities, however, attractiveness does not predict
   significantly more acceptant attitudes. Conclusion Good-looking people

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{70}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{135-152}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The EU Broiler Directive came into force in the UK in June 2010 with the
   aim of setting new minimum standards, monitoring broiler welfare and
   addressing any welfare problems. A survey questionnaire was used to
   elicit information from a stratified sample of citizens in England and
   Wales regarding their willingness to pay for the provisions of the
   Directive, as an estimate of the consumer surplus associated with the
   legislation. We also explore the usefulness of Prelec's () Bayesian
   Truth Serum (BTS) in promoting respondents' truthful reporting. A median
   willingness to pay of 21.50 pound per household per year (corrected for
   sample bias and possible `yea saying') was estimated from 665 responses.
   This provides an estimated benefit of the legislation to citizens of
   over 503 pound million per year, equivalent to 5.3\% of current consumer
   expenditure on chicken. This compares to an estimated 22 pound million
   per year cost of producers' compliance and government enforcement
   associated with the legislation. No statistically significant
   differences in responses between respondents that did and did not have a
   BTS incentive to answer questions truthfully were found, which might
   reflect apparently truthful answers in this case, an insufficiently
   strong financial incentive or a weakened effect due to an element of
   disbelief in the BTS amongst the sample. The analysis suggests that the
   benefits of the Broiler Directive to citizens greatly outweigh the
   additional costs to producers, making a case for the legislation to be
   retained.}},

Title = {{What influences European private forest owners' affinity for subsidies?}},
Journal = {{FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{136-144}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This study analyses the linkages between private forest owners'
   perceptions of forest management, and their affinity for subsidies, in a
   range of European countries. Society increasingly requires the provision
   of ecosystem services from forests, but the willingness of forest owners
   to redirect management goals from wood production to the provision of
   public goods is crucial for sustaining ecosystem services. EU incentives
   in the forestry sector are still mainly oriented towards an
   anthropocentric vision of forest management. Forest owners and managers
   are diverse, and although many efforts have been made to understand the
   role of forest subsidies in private forest management, it is still
   necessary to analyse the different perspectives on forest subsidies with
   a regional comparative approach. This paper explores European private
   forest owners' affinity for subsidies - through survey data at European
   level-and estimates an ordered probit model to (i) analyse how private
   forest owners in Europe respond to subsidies in forestry, including
   regional differences in terms of affinity for subsidies, (ii)
   characterize the factors that influence these responses and (iii)
   discuss lessons learned related to forest owners' attitudes on subsidies
   and the implications for introducing similar kind of incentives such as
   payments for ecosystem services. Simulations were conducted to examine
   the potential effects of changes in property fragmentation or the time
   allotted to forest activities. Forest owners with an utilitarian view of
   forest management, bigger forest holdings, full or part-time farmers and
   forest owners from East Europe are most in favour of forest subsidies.
   Property fragmentation and absenteeism decreases affinity for subsidies.}},

Title = {{Improving Care for the Frail in Nova Scotia: An Implementation
   Evaluation of a Frailty Portal in Primary Care Practice}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{8}},

Pages = {{112-123}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background: Understanding and addressing the needs of frail patients has
   been identified as an important strategy by the Nova Scotia Health
   Authority (NSHA). Primary care (PC) providers are in a key position to
   aid in the identification of, and response to frailty as part of routine
   care. Unlike singular chronic conditions such as diabetes and
   hypertension which garner a disease-based approach and identification as
   part of standard practice, frailty is only just emerging as a concept
   for PC. The web-based Frailty Portal was developed to aid in the
   identification of, assessment and care planning for frail patients in PC
   practice. In this study we assess the implementation feasibility and
   impact of the Frailty Portal by: (1) identifying factors influencing the
   Frailty Portal's use in community PC practice, and (2) examination of
   the immediate impact of the `Frailty Portal' on frail patients, their
   caregivers and PC providers.
   Methods: A convergent mixed method approach was implemented among PC
   providers in community-based practice in the NSHA, Central Zone.
   Quantitative and qualitative data were collected concurrently over a
   9-month period. A sample of patients who underwent assessment and/or
   their caregiver were approached for survey participation.
   Results: Fourteen community PC providers (10 family physicians, 4 nurse
   practitioners) completed 48 patient assessments and completed or begun
   41 care plans; semi-structured interviews were conducted among 9
   providers. Nine patients and 5 caregivers participated in the survey. PC
   providers viewed frailty as an important concept but implementation
   challenges were met, primarily with respect to the time required for use
   and lack of fit with traditional practice routines. Additional barriers
   included tool usability and accessibility, training and care planning
   steps, and privacy. Impacts of the tools use with respect to confidence
   and knowledge showed early promise.
   Conclusion: This feasibility study highlights the need for added health
   system supports, resources and financial incentives for successful
   implementation of the Frailty Portal in community PC practice. We
   suggest future implementation integrate the Frailty Portal to practice
   electronic medical records (EMRs) and target providers with largely
   geriatric practice populations and those practicing within
   interdisciplinary, collaborative primary healthcare (PHC) teams.}},

Journal = {{NATURAL HAZARDS REVIEW}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{For decades, Florida residents have lost billions of dollars in property
   damage because of wind and wind-driven rainwater intrusion from tropical
   cyclones. Engineers and scientists have demonstrated that future losses
   can be reduced significantly with practical resilience-enhancing
   mitigation measures. The role of policy makers therefore is to design
   successful strategies that will result in the adoption of approved
   mitigation measures by homeowners. The rational design and delivery of
   vulnerability information and mitigation options are a critical part of
   such programs. Confronting and overcoming the significant upfront costs
   of mitigation with novel financing mechanisms is essential as well. To
   maximize the use of constrained funding allocated for resilience
   policies, this paper explores the effectiveness of vulnerability
   information and financial assistance programs to facilitate mitigation
   using online survey responses from households across Florida. The survey
   is designed to test preferences for low- and high-cost roofing and
   opening protection measures to reduce hurricane-related damages in the
   context of information and incentive treatments. Empirical analysis
   indicates that financial incentives are preferred to vulnerability
   information to foster mitigation.}},

Title = {{Successful referral behavior in referral reward programs}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SERVICE MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{48-74}},
Month = {{JAN 14}},
Abstract = {{Purpose Referral reward programs (RRPs) incentivize existing customers
   (inductors) to refer new customers (inductees). The effectiveness of
   RRPs is not well understood as previous studies either focused on
   referral intent and/or ignored inductee responses. However, an RRP is
   only effective if inductors recommend and inductees respond with buying
   the service. The purpose of this paper is to examine the drivers of
   existing customers' successful referral behavior.
   Design/methodology/approach This study combines a bank's customer
   relationship management (CRM) data which were used to identify
   successful inductors and non-inductors. Then, observed behavioral and
   customer background data from the CRM database (including successful
   referrals, deposits in euros, number of products held, relationship
   duration, income, age, and gender) were combined with survey data
   capturing attitudinal variables (i.e. perceived relationship quality,
   reward attractiveness, referral metaperception, opportunism, and
   involvement). This approach allowed for the simultaneous testing of all
   hypothesized drivers of successful referral behavior. Findings
   Metaperception (i.e. the process by which individuals determine the
   impressions other might form of them and their behavior) was the
   strongest and most significant driver of successful RRP participation,
   followed by attractiveness of the reward. That is, inductors recommended
   successfully when they believed that their incentivized referral did not
   look bad (or even looked good) and incentives were perceived as
   attractive. This finding is important as metaperception so far has only
   been examined in theoretical and experimental studies with intent as
   dependent variables. Second, latent class analysis (LCA) revealed that
   there were two segments of inductors of which one was opportunistic.
   Opportunism as a driver of referral behavior has not been shown in past
   research using more traditional analyses, whereas LCA uncovered it as a
   driver for one-third of all respondents.
   Practical implications - The findings offer managers a better
   understanding of the key determinants of successful referral behavior
   with important RRP design implications that counter frequent practice
   (e.g. designing RRPs with high face value but then reducing its
   usefulness through terms and conditions). Furthermore, managers may
   consider segment-specific reward structures to improve the effectiveness
   of their RRPs.
   Originality/value - This study is the first to examine inductor
   determinants of successful referral behavior and identify inductor
   segments.}},

Journal = {{SURVEY RESEARCH METHODS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{153-165}},
Abstract = {{To combat the potentially detrimental effects of nonresponse, most
   surveys repeatedly followup with nonrespondents, often targeting a
   response rate or predetermined number of completes. Each additional
   recruitment attempt generally brings in a new wave of data, but returns
   gradually diminish over the course of a static data collection protocol.
   Consequently, (nonresponse-adjusted) point estimates calculated from the
   accumulating data begin to stabilize. This is the notion of phase
   capacity, suggesting some form of design change is warranted, such as
   switching modes, increasing the incentive, or simply discontinuing
   nonrespondent follow-up.Phase capacity testing methods that have
   appeared in the literature to date are generally only applicable to a
   single point estimate. It is unclear how to proceed if conflicting
   results are obtained following independent tests on two or more point
   estimates. The purpose of this paper is to introduce two multivariate
   phase capacity tests, one referred to as the Wald chi-square method and
   another referred to as the non-zero trajectory method. Both methods are
   designed to provide a universal, yes-or-no phase capacity determination
   for a battery of point estimates. The two competing methods' performance
   is compared via simulation and application using data from the 2011
   Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey. All else equal, the Wald chi-square
   method is found to detect phase capacity sooner than the non-zero
   trajectory method.}},

Journal = {{TOURISM REVIEW}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to review the current status of
   certification and certified hotels on the African continent, and to
   discuss the implications for mainstreaming sustainable tourism on the
   continent.
   Design/methodology/approach - The research design focused on a
   literature review and an online survey. The survey was used to consult
   stakeholders on options for incentives, and future interventions, which
   was distributed to 80 stakeholders from the government, certification
   bodies, intergovernmental agencies and NGOs. The survey resulted in 41
   complete responses from 18 countries.
   Findings - The study identified nine African certification programs, and
   nine international certification programs operating in Africa.
   Collectively, the African and international certification programs have
   certified at least 715 accommodation facilities in 19 African countries,
   against their environmental, social and economic criteria. So only a
   very small proportion of all hotels in Africa have been certified
   (certainly less than 3.4 per cent) and that these are patchily
   distributed across the continent. A number of incentives have been used
   in Africa, including marketing and promotion; interest free loans for
   new technologies; preferential inclusion in tour itineraries; free or
   discounted application processes; and technical support. Consultees
   suggested that hotels were generally motivated to seek certification to:
   promote their achievements to environmentally conscious clients and
   avoid negative criticism, and save money by conserving resources.
   However, hotels do not understand the financial benefits of sustainable
   practices.
   Research limitations/implications - Research limitations include the
   modest sample size. For the purposes of this research, there was a
   greater emphasis in targeting a modest number of key respondents who
   could provide expert opinions on the topic, rather than a more extensive
   sample size of lower quality.
   Practical implications - Practical implications include recommendations
   of incentives and approaches to mainstream tourism certification in
   Africa. These include promoting programmes and their returns on
   investment more broadly, promoting market advantage for certified
   accommodation (i.e. preferential marketing or concession terms) and the
   value of integrating sustainability criteria into national and regional
   quality-rating standards.
   Originality/value - This is the first study of its kind to analyse
   certification on the African continent, which was presented at the
   Climate Change Summit (COP22) in Morocco in 2016 and the BEST EN Think
   Tank XVII in June 2017.}},

Pages = {{1629-1636}},
Abstract = {{Objective. To characterize use of the Pharmacy Curriculum Outcomes
   Assessment (PCOA) in terms of timing, manner of delivery, and
   application of the results by accredited colleges of pharmacy.
   Methods. Accredited pharmacy programs were surveyed regarding PCOA
   administration, perceived benefits, and practical application of score
   reports. Survey items were comprised of new items developed from a
   literature review and items from prior studies. The survey addressed
   five domains: program demographics, administration, student preparation,
   use of results, and recommendations to improve the utility of the PCOA.
   Results. Responses were received from 126 of 139 (91\%) surveyed
   programs. The majority of respondent programs administered PCOA in one
   session on a single campus. Most indicated PCOA results had limited use
   for individual student assessment. Almost half reported that results
   were or could be useful in curriculum review and benchmarking.
   Considerable variability existed in the preparation and incentives for
   PCOA performance. Differences in some results were found based on prior
   PCOA experience and between new vs older programs. Open-ended responses
   provided suggestions to enhance the application and utility of PCOA.
   Conclusion. The intended uses of PCOA results, such as for student
   assessment, curricular review, and programmatic benchmarking, are not
   being implemented across the academy. Streamlining examination
   logistics, providing additional examination-related data, and clarifying
   the purpose of the examination to faculty members and students may
   increase the utility of PCOA results.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives As healthcare decision makers continue to face challenges in

   \& Early Awareness Interest Group, the EuroScan International Network
   and International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment.
   Results Among the 362 invitees, twenty-four unique responses were
   received, and almost 70 percent were involved in disinvestment
   initiatives. The disinvestment candidates identified represented a range
   of health technologies. Evidence or signaling of clinical
   ineffectiveness or inappropriate use typically led to the nomination of
   disinvestment candidates. Health technology assessments and
   reassessments were usually conducted to evaluate the technology in
   question, and decisions usually led to the limited use of the
   technology. Barriers to disinvestment decisions included the strength of
   interest and advocacy groups, insufficient data for assessments, a
   systematic decision process and political challenges, while obstacles to
   their implementation were clinicians' reluctance and insufficient
   funding and incentives. Conclusions The survey results suggested that
   disinvestment activities are occurring in the HTA community, especially
   in the public sector. Future research can further investigate the
   processes and methods used to reach and implement disinvestment
   decisions from our survey respondents and explore to form closer ties

Title = {{Association Between Financial Incentives and Participant Deception About
   Study Eligibility}},
Journal = {{JAMA NETWORK OPEN}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE Offers of payment for research participation are ubiquitous
   but may lead prospective participants to deceive about eligibility,
   jeopardizing study integrity and participant protection. To date,
   neither the rate of payment-induced deception nor the influence of
   payment amount has been systematically studied in a nationally
   representative randomized survey experiment.
   OBJECTIVES To estimate payment-associated deception about eligibility
   for an online survey and to assess whether there is an association
   between payment amount and deception frequency.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized, 7-group survey experiment.
   Data were collected in March 2018 and analyzed from March to August
   2018. The setting was a nationally representative online survey among US
   adults drawn from the GfK KnowledgePanel.
   INTERVENTIONS Varying payment amounts for participation (\$5, \$10, or
   \$20 cash equivalent) and direction of eligibility criterion (having
   received or not having received an influenza vaccination in the past 6
   months).
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Proportion of respondents reporting recent
   influenza vaccination.
   RESULTS In total, 2275 individuals participated in the survey, a
   59.4\%(2275 of 3829) response rate; 51.8\%(1108) were female, and 21.1\%
   of respondents (399) were aged 18 to 29 years, 24.9\%(532) were aged 30
   to 44 years, 26.0\%(601) were aged 45 to 59 years, and 28.0\%(738) were
   60 years or older. For participants offered a \$5 incentive, the
   reported frequency of recent influenza vaccination was 16.6\% higher
   (95\% CI, 9.1\%-24.1\%) among those told that eligibility (and thus
   payment) required recent vaccination than among those told that
   eligibility required no recent vaccination. The corresponding
   differences were 21.0\%(95\% CI, 13.5\%-28.5\%) among those offered \$10
   and 15.4\% (95\% CI, 7.8\%-23.0\%) among those offered \$20. Estimated
   proportions of ineligible individuals who responded deceptively
   regarding eligibility ranged from 10.5\% to 22.8\% across study groups.
   There was no evidence that higher payment was associated with higher
   frequency of deception.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In a nationally representative randomized
   survey experiment to evaluate whether and to what extent payment is
   associated with participants misleading investigators about their
   research eligibility, this study found evidence of significant
   deception. However, no association was observed between payment amount
   and frequency of deception. Further research is needed to extend these
   findings to clinical research. These data suggest that, when possible,
   investigators should rely on objective tests of eligibility rather than
   self-report.}},

Title = {{Setting course for demand response in the service sector}},
Journal = {{ENERGY EFFICIENCY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{327-341}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The increasing share of renewable energies in electricity generation is
   within the scope of the energy transition and will lead to a more
   volatile generation of electricity. A more flexible energy demand could
   contribute to handling the resulting challenges in electricity grid
   management. The service sector is one of the target groups for utilizing
   flexible demand, also called demand response (DR). Supermarkets, hotels,
   and office buildings can be found in regions throughout Germany. This
   could be an advantage regarding the compensation of grid instability in
   any region, compared to more locally focused industrial enterprises.
   First estimations point out considerable unused DR potentials for the
   service sector. However, currently, there is less knowledge about
   flexibility options in the service sector than in industry. Moreover,
   market barriers, such as a missing adequate regulatory framework
   offering attractive incentives prevent that the potentials are tapped.
   Therefore, in this paper, we first analyze survey data from 1.000
   enterprises of the service sector in Germany to identify subsectors that
   have a high share of flexible cross-sectoral technologies in electricity
   consumption. Data indicates that the subsectors trade, restaurants, and
   hotels as well as office-like buildings are the most promising
   subsectors of the service sector regarding demand response potential,
   since they have a high stock in flexible cooling appliances, air
   conditioning, and ventilation. In a second step, we conducted
   stakeholder interviews, to find specific barriers, drivers, and possible
   starting points in each of the identified subsectors. Still unapt or
   missing regulatory framework conditions, low profitability, and a lack
   of knowledge regarding flexibility potentials and marketing mechanisms
   seem to be the main barriers. However, framework conditions promoting
   demand response measures are improving, e.g., technical standards and
   latest regulatory revisions. This indicates that in order to tap the
   existing demand response potentials in the service sector, the value of
   flexibility in demand needs to be appreciated, e.g., by facilitating
   market participation or by creating offers resp. rewarding the
   enterprises' flexibility of demand. In addition, addressing demand
   response issues in already existing policy measures, such as energy
   audits could raise awareness and knowledge.}},

Title = {{Efficacy of Medical Student Surgery Journal Club}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SURGICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{76}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{83-88}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Journal clubs exist in a variety of forms in medical schools
   across the United States. Many incorporate a full spectrum of medical
   specialties, some are specific to certain interest groups or
   specialties, and many widely vary in whether or not they are school
   mandated or student-run. While these clubs are ubiquitously scattered
   throughout medical education, there has been very little quantitative or
   qualitative analysis regarding the efficacy of these clubs in enhancing
   medical students' abilities to evaluate clinical literature. The purpose
   of this study was to evaluate the effects of attending Surgical Journal
   Club meetings at Eastern Virginia Medical School from both a qualitative
   and quantitative perspective. The authors' hypothesis was that regular
   attendance of these sessions would improve student performance from a
   multitude of perspectives and demonstrate the value of clinical
   literature analysis earlier in medical education.
   METHODS: A fifteen question Likert survey was administered on an
   optional basis to thirty-six medical students attending journal club.
   Responses were analyzed anonymously, and there was no incentive or
   demerit for completing the survey. Data was compiled and the mean,
   median, and mode for each question calculated with ``5{''} corresponding
   to ``Strongly Agree{''} and ``1{''} corresponding to ``Strongly
   Disagree.{''}
   RESULTS: Twenty-seven of thirty-six attendees to our seventh journal
   club meeting completed the survey. Student responses were overwhelming
   positive, with all but one question reaching above ``Agree{''} by
   analysis of the mean responses.
   CONCLUSION: Journal clubs remain an integral part of medical education
   but their importance has been diminished in recent years due to the
   increasing demands of other aspects of the first two years in medical
   school. We described a medical student run/established journal club that
   increased students' interest in surgery, their perceived knowledge-base,
   and comfort in critically analyzing medical journal articles. ((C) 2018

Title = {{Using financial incentives to attract medical residents to the
   periphery: The Israeli experience}},
Journal = {{HEALTH POLICY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{123}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{80-86}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background: In 2011, Israel instituted financial incentives as part of a
   larger program to attract doctors to residency programs in peripheral
   hospitals.
   Objective: To explore the impact of these incentives and related changes
   on the choices of locations for residency training in Israel.
   Methods: We performed (A) an analysis of administrative data on the
   location of all new medical residencies in 2005-2014 (B) an
   internet/phone survey of residents who began specialty training in
   2013-2014, with a response rate of 71\%.
   Results: (A) Of all entrants to residency training programs in Israel,
   those in peripheral hospitals constituted 16-20\% in 2005-2010, 19\% in
   2011, 23\% in 2012, and 23\% in 2013; the increase consisted
   predominantly of physicians who were graduates of non-Israeli medical
   schools (B) About half of all residents in the periphery reported that
   the incentives contributed to their choice of residency location. About
   40\% of that group also reported that they had planned already in
   medical school to practice in the periphery, while 60\% of that group
   (30\% of all residents in the periphery) did not have such plans prior
   to medical school. About 70\% of the residents in peripheral hospitals
   grew up in the periphery; for the southern periphery this was 40\% and
   for the northern periphery this was 80\%.
   Conclusions: The changes instituted in 2011 apparently affected
   residency location preferences for a non-negligible proportion of young
   physicians, particularly among those who grew up in the periphery.
   Policymakers should consider combining targeted incentives with measures
   to increase the supply of physicians who grew up in the periphery. (C)

Abstract = {{Changing individual's recycling attitude and behaviour is of utmost
   importance in achieving sustainable construction and demolition (C\&D)
   waste management, yet it has often been underachieved. To understand the
   motivations for recycling, this study identifies and prioritizes the key
   factors that affect C\&D waste recycling behaviour of various
   stakeholders in Hong Kong (i.e., representatives from
   construction-waste-related organizations, environmental consultants and
   contractors, and government engineers) in a quantitative manner using
   statistical tools. Different from traditional C\&D waste behavioural
   determinants studies, this paper utilizes an integrated analytical
   method through semi structured interviews and survey questionnaire on
   the basis of Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). Qualitative thematic
   analysis and quantitative frequency analysis were performed to analyse
   responses from semi-structured interviews and questionnaires, followed
   by correlation analysis to quantify the relationships between factors.
   Results indicated that four key factors: (i) regulatory compliance, (ii)
   economic incentives, (iii) accreditation scheme, and (iv) logistics and
   management incentives directly influenced recycling behaviour of
   individuals. Regulatory compliance was the most determining factor for
   consultants, contractors, experts, and government officials, whereas
   economic incentives were of great concern to the public. Under the
   factor of economic incentives, strong positive relationships were
   identified between disposal costs and collection and sorting costs, thus
   increasing waste disposal charging fee may promote recycling behaviour.
   In comparison, accreditation scheme deserved better recognition to
   facilitate a closed-loop material flow in the construction industry.
   These findings help to devise more effective and stakeholder-oriented
   policy tools to raise awareness and encourage behavioural change towards
   C\&D waste recycling, and assist policy makers to establish regulations
   and practices for sustainable resource management. (C) 2018 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In recent years, the government and community have focused extensive
   attention on food waste recycling to achieve sustainable waste
   management. However, the motivation of stakeholders from the commercial
   and industrial sector to change recycling behaviour has not received
   enough attention. This study aimed to identify, prioritise, and quantify
   the relationships between key latent variables that affect the food
   waste recycling behaviour of relevant industries in Hong Kong (i.e.
   representatives from the hotel, food and beverages, and property
   management industries). This study integrated semi-structured interviews
   and a survey questionnaire on the basis of the Theory of Planned
   Behaviour, setting it apart from conventional studies on food waste
   behavioural factors. Qualitative content analysis and quantitative
   structural equation modelling were performed to analyse the interview
   and questionnaire responses, followed by correlation analysis to
   quantify the relationships between variables. The results demonstrate
   that food waste recycling behaviour is determined by three latent
   variables-administrative incentives and corporate support, logistics and
   management incentives, and economic incentives. Administrative
   incentives and corporate support demonstrate significant effects on
   recycling behaviour. Moral attitudes show a strong positive correlation
   with administrative incentives and corporate support. Similarly, there
   is a significant positive correlation between moral attitudes and
   logistics and management incentives. Administrative incentives and
   corporate support is the determining variable for the hotel and food and
   beverages industries, whereas logistics and management incentives are of
   the highest concern to property management representatives. These
   findings can facilitate the development of stakeholder-oriented policy
   to encourage corporate behavioural change towards food waste recycling

   undertaken concurrently or within a period that does not provide
   agencies the ability to establish, with certainty, that one method or
   strategy contributed more to improved safety versus another. Successful
   programs examined in the case studies have been effective because of
   multifaceted, coordinated efforts to address transit safety. Strategies

Abstract = {{During the last 40 years, China has undergone rapid urbanization which
   has resulted in land degradation and a decrease in land. Cultivated land
   protection has thus become one of the most active and important aspects
   of land science. This study presents a pressure-response-impact (PRI)
   framework which may reveal the inter-correlations among households'
   land-use behavior and cultivated land quality change in the process of
   rapid urbanization in China. The structural equation model (SEM) has
   been applied using a household survey dataset collected in 2015 in
   Sujiatun district, Shenyang city, Liaoning province. The results show
   that: (1) there is a complex causal relationship between the latent
   variables urbanization, household land-use behavior and cultivated land
   quality (i.e., urbanization land-use behavior land quality), which
   supports our PRI conceptual framework; (2) the changes of external
   social-economic context stemming from urbanization are the major cause
   of land-use behavior variance; (3) land quality is mostly affected by
   farmers' land-use behavior including land-use pattern, land-use degree
   and land-input intensity, in particular the growing of cash crops (GCC,
   associated with land use pattern) and capital input per unit of farmland
   (LII, associated with land input intensity). These findings are of some
   theoretical and practical significance. Theoretically, they add to the
   current literature by identifying the roles of sociological factors and
   farmers' land-use behavior in the process of land quality protection
   using a PRI framework. Practically, measures should be taken to
   reasonably set the prices of agricultural products, promote the
   development of the land rental market and increase the comparative
   revenue of agricultural production, so as to stimulate incentives to
   farming and land quality protection.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Financial incentives can support smoking cessation, yet
   low acceptability may limit the wider implementation of such schemes.
   Few studies have examined how smokers view financial-incentive
   interventions aimed at reducing smoking prevalence.
   Methods: We recruited a sample of 623 smokers from an internet panel to
   a survey assessing support for, and perceived effectiveness of,
   financial incentives for smoking cessation. We used descriptive
   statistics, plus logistic regression, to test associations between
   demographics and smoking, and support. We used qualitative content
   analysis to analyze open-ended responses to a question that invited
   respondents to comment on financial incentives.
   Results: Financial incentives were supported by 38.4\% of smokers;
   42.2\% did not support and 19.4\% had no opinion. Support was higher
   among heavy (OR = 3.96, 95\% CI = 2.39 to 6.58) and moderate smokers (OR
   = 1.68, 95\% CI = 1.13 to 2.49), and those with a recent quit attempt
   (OR = 1.47, 95\% CI = 1.04 to 2.07). Support was strongly associated
   with perceived effectiveness. A Government-funded reward-only scheme was
   seen as the most acceptable option (preferred by 26.6\% of
   participants), followed by a Government-funded deposit-based scheme
   (20.6\%); few respondents supported employer-funded schemes. Open-ended
   responses (n = 301) indicated three overarching themes expressing
   opposition to financial incentives: smokers' individual responsibility
   for quitting, concerns about abuse of an incentive scheme, and concerns
   about unfairness.
   Conclusion: Even amongst those who would benefit from schemes designed
   to reward smokers for quitting, support for such schemes is muted,
   despite the evidence of their effectiveness. Media advocacy and health
   education could be used to increase the understanding of, and support
   for, financial incentives for smoking cessation.}},

   Methods. A simple cross-sectional survey was conducted at an academic
   medical center. Participants included medical students and employees in
   Internal Medicine, General Surgery, and the Organ Transplantation
   Center. Pearson's chi(2) and Fisher's exact test were conducted on the
   responses regarding disincentives and incentives to determine whether
   opinions differed based on age.
   Results. Six hundred and twenty-four participants completed the survey.
   There was no statistical difference in opinions between groups on
   reimbursing transportation costs, loss of wages, or childcare costs, but
   those aged >= 25 were more agreeable with covering food/lodging costs
   compared to those < 25 (96.5\% vs 90.7\%, P = .009). Respondents < 25
   years old were more willing to donate a kidney for a financial incentive
   (P = .0002) accepting a median amount of \$25,000.
   Conclusions. Health care personnel broadly support removing financial
   disincentives for living kidney donation, and those >= 25 were more in
   favor of covering food/lodging costs compared to those < 25. Those < 25
   years old were more likely to accept financial incentives towards
   donating their kidney compared to those >= 25 years.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, numerous studies have been conducted to evaluate the
   demand for acquiring electric vehicles (EVs) by household with little
   attention given to the commercial fleet sector. Within the latter,
   rental vehicles account for the majority of fleets in Canada.
   Eventually, the acquisition of rental vehicles by their respective
   companies is driven by consumers' demand for these vehicles in the
   market. This research provides a pioneering effort to evaluate Canadian
   consumers' preferences towards renting EVs. A nationwide stated
   preference (SP) survey was conducted to collect information from over
   1000 respondents. Each respondent was presented with six choice
   scenarios, and each scenario featured the following vehicle powertrains:
   internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV), hybrid electric vehicle
   (HEV), plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) and battery electric
   vehicle (BEV). The collected SP responses, along with socio-demo-graphic
   and attitudinal characteristics of the respondents, were analyzed using
   a latent class discrete choice model to identify the potential segments
   with unique features present in the sample population. The model
   identified the following four distinct latent classes: ICEV-oriented
   (22\%), EV-curious (34\%), Cost-sensitive (24\%), and EV-oriented
   (20\%). Based on the empirical analysis, the potential for renting
   electric vehicles among the EV-curious and the EV-oriented classes could
   increase with improvements in vehicle driving range and battery
   recharging time. Further, provision of monetary incentives (e.g., free
   vehicle upgrades, rental discounts and no rental taxes) could also
   increase the probability of renting HEVs by the Cost-sensitive
   consumers.}},

Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2627-2638}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This study investigates how the ecosystem services (ES) linked to
   livestock grazing are perceived across countries. A total of 82 case
   studies collected from 42 countries via survey (53.7\% cases from Europe
   and 46.3\% from outside of Europe) have been analysed through a
   multivariate approach. In all, 18 non-provisioning ES were considered.
   Overall, the reported impacts of livestock grazing on the different ES
   were much more positive than negative. Notably, a large proportion of
   respondents reported either positive or very positive impacts for some
   cultural ES, namely cultural, historic and natural heritage (84\%),
   knowledge systems and educational values (77\%), landscape values
   (74\%), and for some supporting and regulating ES, namely habitat
   provision (66\%), nutrient cycling (65\%), and bush encroachment/fire
   control (66\%). Based on multiple regression analysis, geographic
   origin, stakeholder type and species category, as well as protection
   status of the grazing area, had significant effects on the perception of
   the impacts. Respondents reported those impacts as more positive in
   Europe, in protected areas and where several species were present in the
   grazing area. A significantly larger proportion of respondents reported
   recognition of ES provided by the grazing livestock population in
   European countries (40.9\%) compared with non-European countries
   (23.7\%). Based on the survey responses it appears that in non-European
   countries absence of formal recognition, especially by policy makers, is
   a major challenge for the continued provision of ES in grazing systems.
   In Europe, where such recognition is already often included in
   legislation, the long-term sustainability of related policies and
   incentives to provide such services is viewed as a major issue by the
   respondents.}},

Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{6, SI}},
Pages = {{575-582}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Workplace aggression is a major work health and safety, and
   public health concern. To date, there has been limited investigation of
   population level exposure and responses to workplace aggression from all
   sources, and little evidence on the experiences, reporting and
   support-seeking behaviour of nurses, midwives and care personnel in
   Australian settings.
   Aim: To determine the 12-month prevalence of aggression experienced by
   nurses, midwives and care personnel from sources external and internal
   to the organisation, and the reporting behaviours and support sought
   from employers, health services, Trade Unions, work health and safety
   agencies, police and legal services.
   Methods: An online survey of the membership of the Australian Nursing
   and Midwifery Federation Victorian Branch was conducted between 1 st May
   and 30th June 2017.
   Findings: In the previous 12 months, 96.5\% of respondents experienced
   workplace aggression, with 90.9\% experiencing aggression from external
   sources and 72.3\% from internal sources. A majority indicated they just
   accepted incidents of aggression, and most rarely or never took time off
   work, sought medical or psychological treatment, or sought
   organisational or other institutional support, advice or action. Levels
   of satisfaction with institutional services were mostly neutral to poor.
   Discussion: Victorian nurses, midwives and care personnel work in
   aggressive and violent workplaces. The incivility endemic in health care
   likely sets the climate for the generation of and exposure to so much
   explicit aggression and violence. It appears that any systems or
   processes instituted to protect health care personnel from harm are
   failing.
   Conclusion: More targeted and effectively operationalised legislation,
   incentives and penalties are likely required. Further research may
   elaborate the extent of the impact of exposure to workplace aggression
   over time. (C) 2018 Australian College of Nursing Ltd. Published by

Abstract = {{Objectives: Available published advice on use of incentives is limited

   views of researchers in the field, to provide guidance on acceptable
   incentives. We conducted a literature review and a short online survey

   researchers from 14 different countries indicated that 41\% had used
   incentives to increase participation and 29\% to 73\%, depending on

   Based on the literature review and the survey results, and European

   to the value of 30 Euros, based on average EU income levels, may be
   offered as cash, vouchers, or age-appropriate gifts or toys, in addition
   to reimbursing expenses. Additional incentives may be offered if a study
   includes more burdening procedures, techniques that may appear
   frightening for younger children, or requires sustained participation
   (eg, dietary diaries or activity monitoring). There was agreement that
   it is preferable to give toys or gifts rather than money to younger

Abstract = {{This study presents results from an investigation into the effect of

   the survey data in a multinomial logit model to estimate to what extent

   which incentives they prefer. The model results show that respondents
   who sometimes cycle to work are more positive about incentive schemes
   than respondents who never cycle and that offering an app with in-kind
   gifts is probably most effective. Interestingly, non-cyclists are more
   likely to change their behaviour for a reward if they care about travel
   costs, while occasional cyclists are more likely to cycle more often in
   response to incentives if they care about attributes that are related to
   the cycling itself. This also depends on attitudes towards cycling and

Title = {{The contribution of assets to adaptation to extreme temperatures among
   older adults}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 29}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Climate change and extreme temperatures pose increasing challenges to
   individuals and their health with older adults being one of the most
   vulnerable groups. The aim of this paper is to better understand the
   roles that tangible assets (e.g., physical or financial) and intangible
   assets (e.g., human or social) play in the way older adults adapt to
   extreme temperatures, the types of adaptive responses they implement,
   limits and constraints, as well opportunities for better adaptation.
   Rather than focusing exclusively on extremes of heat, or considering
   each type of asset in isolation, the important and novel contribution of
   this paper is to take an integrated and multi-seasonal qualitative and
   quantitative approach, that conjointly investigates all categories of
   assets in relation to the adaptations that independently-living older
   adults make to both extreme heat and extreme cold.
   Methods and findings
   The paper examines the contribution of assets to adaptation to extreme
   temperatures among older adults living independently in their homes. An
   innovative mixed methods study with an inter-seasonal approach was
   implemented in Lisbon, Portugal with interviews and surveys during
   summer for extreme heat and winter for extreme cold. The ability of
   participants to adapt to extreme temperatures was found to be dependent
   on asset context and diversity, and the dynamics through which extreme
   temperatures enhanced or reduced the stock of assets available. As a
   result, participants engaged in activities of assets replacement,
   exchange or substitutions. Despite this, many participants recognised
   many constraints and limits to their ability to adapt and protect their
   health and well-being ranging from reduced income, high energy costs and
   lack of social networks. Opportunities for improving older adults'
   adaptation were found to exist and strategies, action and investment
   have been identified by older adults which included life-long education,
   incentives to improve insulation and local activities.
   Conclusions
   The paper suggests that the implementation of the proposed asset-based
   approach linking assets and adaptation to extreme temperatures,
   illustrates the key pathway that individuals, their families and carers,
   governments, policymakers, researchers and practitioners can follow to
   ensure effective adaptation and promote health and well-being.
   Supporting older adults' adaptation to extreme temperatures is possible
   and can be complemented with efforts to reduce older adults'
   vulnerability and building resilience to extreme temperatures. These
   findings pose concrete implications for policy and practice, including
   for example the need for implementation of measures and actions to
   reduce poverty, reduce energy costs, improve the quality of the housing
   stock and improve older adults' social networks.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of payment-for-performance (P4P) schemes in the health sector
   has been documented, but there has been little attention to the
   distributional effects of P4P across health facilities. We examined the
   distribution of P4P payouts over time and assessed whether increased
   service coverage due to P4P differed across facilities in Tanzania. We
   used two service outcomes that improved due to P4P {[}facility-based
   deliveries and provision of antimalarials during antenatal care (ANC)],
   to also assess whether incentive design matters for performance
   inequalities. We used data from 150 facilities from intervention and
   comparison areas in January 2012 and 13 months later. Our primary data
   were gathered through facility survey and household survey, while data
   on performance payouts were obtained from the programme administrator.
   Descriptive inequality measures were used to examine the distribution of
   payouts across facility subgroups. Difference-in-differences regression
   analyses were used to identify P4P differential effects on the two
   service coverage outcomes across facility subgroups. We found that
   performance payouts were initially higher among higher-level facilities
   (hospitals and health centres) compared with dispensaries, among
   facilities with more medical commodities and among facilities serving
   wealthier populations, but these inequalities declined over time. P4P
   had greater effects on coverage of institutional deliveries among
   facilities with low baseline performance, serving middle wealth
   populations and located in rural areas. P4P effects on antimalarials
   provision during ANC was similar across facilities. Performance
   inequalities were influenced by the design of incentives and a range of
   facility characteristics; however, the nature of the service being
   targeted is also likely to have affected provider response. Further
   research is needed to examine in more detail the effects of incentive
   design on outcomes and researchers should be encouraged to report on
   design aspects in their evaluations of P4P and systematically monitor
   and report subgroup effects across providers.}},

Abstract = {{Deforestation associated with agricultural expansion, particularly that
   of extensive cattle ranching, remains a pressing challenge for
   sustainable development and climate mitigation efforts in South America.
   In response to these challenges, national and local governments, as well
   as private and non-governmental actors, have developed new forest
   conservation governance mechanisms. In addition to reducing
   deforestation for agricultural expansion, it is hoped that these
   policies may lead to the intensification of existing agricultural
   regions, thereby contributing to global food availability and continued
   rural development. The objective of this study is to understand the
   timing and spatial patterns of crop and pasture intensification in
   agriculture-forest frontiers in the context of changing conservation
   policies and rural development. We focus on Mato Grosso, the largest soy
   and cattle producing state in Brazil, which spans the Cerrado and Amazon
   biomes and has experienced among the highest levels of deforestation for
   agricultural expansion globally. Using econometric analysis of remotely
   sensed and agricultural survey data, we find that cropland and pasture
   intensification are both linked to increasing forest conservation
   restrictions and broader supply chain development. However, the effect
   of conservation restrictions on intensification is lower in regions
   where there is more forest remaining. While crop and pasture area
   dynamics are often coupled in agriculture-forest frontiers, crop
   intensification does not appear to have contributed to pasture
   intensification through animal feed production. Intensification of crop
   and pasture areas was associated with temporary, immediate reductions in
   local deforestation, but crop intensification was associated with
   increased deforestation over longer time periods. These results suggest
   that targeted investments in supply chain infrastructure in the Amazon
   frontier could promote intensification and relieve pressure to clear
   forests, but must be coupled with substantial, long-term negative
   incentives for deforestation, including more effective public forest
   governance and private zero-deforestation commitments.}},

   additionality for nitrogen abatement is 97\% for enrolled farmers when
   only the direct treatment effect on cover crops is taken into account,
   but reductions in vegetative cover (slippage) and indirect effects on
   conservation tillage are consequential. Slippage is particularly large
   among farmers not currently enrolled in the program, indicating that
   loss of vegetative cover may substantially offset pollution abatement if
   cost sharing is extended to this group. These findings suggest that

   species of concern was greater in clearcuts and clearcuts with
   post-harvest treatments. Vegetative features associated with greater
   richness and abundance of spruce-fir birds, such as greater spruce-fir
   composition and smaller tree diameter at breast height, were prominent
   in regenerating clearcuts and post-harvest treatments and suggested that
   these management practices promote local abundances and richness of
   spruce-fir birds. Richness and abundances of spruce-fir birds were least
   in selection, shelterwood, and mature stands, and vegetative features
   associated with greater richness and abundance of spruce-fir birds were
   diminished in these stands. Forestry trends in Maine indicate that the
   extent of the clearcut suite of treatments has decreased on the
   landscape while selection and shelterwood harvests have increased. Thus,
   changes in incentives for managers to apply even-aged management coupled
   with postharvest applications of herbicides or precommercial thinning
   might mitigate further declines in habitat for spruce-fir passerines
   assemblages. A greater ratio of clearcuts with postharvest treatments
   11-40 YSH compared to other treatments (mature forest >= 48 YSH,
   selection and shelterwood 5-41 YSH) would maintain diverse spruce-fir
   bird communities on the landscape. Use of clearcuts with post-harvest
   treatments in the hemiboreal forests of northern New England, southern
   Quebec, and Maritime Provinces of eastern Canada may enhance habitat for
   breeding and post-breeding spruce-fir birds, especially where the
   quantity of conifer forests are declining and residual patches of
   conifers are increasingly fragmented.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The opioid epidemic in the United States is an ongoing public
   health concern. Health care institutions use standardized patient
   satisfaction surveys to assess the patient experience and some offer
   incentives to their providers based on the results. We hypothesized that
   providers who report being incentivized based on patient satisfaction
   surveys are more likely to report an impact of such surveys on their
   opioid prescribing practices.
   Methods: We developed a 23-item survey instrument to assess the
   self-perceived impact of patient satisfaction surveys on opioid
   prescribing practices in primary care and the potential impact of
   institutional incentives. The survey was emailed to all 1404 members of
   the Colorado Academy of Family Physicians.
   Results: The response rate to the online survey was 10.4\% (n = 146).
   Clinical indications for which responders prescribe opioids included
   acute pain (93\%), cancer pain (85\%), and chronic nonmalignant pain
   (72\%). Among physicians using patient satisfaction surveys,
   incentivized physicians reported at least a slight impact on opioid
   prescribing 3 times more often than physicians who were not incentivized
   (36\% vs 12\%, P = .004).
   Conclusions: Efforts to improve patient satisfaction may have
   potentially untoward effects on providers' opioid prescribing behaviors.
   Our results suggest a need to further study the impact of provider
   incentive plans that are based on patient satisfaction scores.}},

Abstract = {{We study the design of incentive contracts based on customer

   principal-agent models to consider budget constraints, survey response
   rates, and correlation between CS measure and demand. We derive the

   contract performance. In contrast to the common belief that customer
   future values are the drivers of CS incentives, we show that CS
   incentives can benefit principals even in a single-period setting where
   customers bring no future value. Improvements can be achieved without
   increasing total reward, because the CS incentive program reveals
   additional information about agents' service effort and diversifies
   their risk. Such effects are overlooked in existing CS research. With
   consideration of correlation between sales and CS measures, we provide a
   metrics selection rule regarding which reward(s)-CS, sales commission,
   or both should be included in an incentive plan. We also study
   cumulative incentive schemes based on commonly used average CS measures

Title = {{Evaluation of non-response to the In-Center Hemodialysis Consumer
   Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (ICH CAHPS) survey}},
Journal = {{BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{OCT 19}},
Abstract = {{Background: The In-Center Hemodialysis Consumer Assessment of Healthcare
   Providers and Systems (ICH CAHPS) Survey is the first patient reported
   outcome measure included in the U.S. Medicare End Stage Renal Disease
   Quality Incentive Program. Administered twice yearly, it assesses
   in-center dialysis experience and survey responses are tied to dialysis
   facility payments. Low response rates, currently approximately 35\%,
   raise concern for possible underrepresentation of patient groups.
   Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of survey administration in 2012 to
   all in-center hemodialysis patients in Dialysis Clinic, Inc. (DCI)
   facilities nationally over 18 years old who received hemodialysis at
   their facility for at least 3 months. Patient-level covariates included
   demographic, clinical, laboratory, and functional characteristics.
   Random effects multivariable logistic regression was used to assess
   survey non-response.
   Results: Among 11,055 eligible patients 6541 (59\%) were non-responders.
   Of the remaining 4514 responders, 549 (14\%) surveys were not usable due
   to presence of proxy help or incomplete responses. Non-responders were
   more likely to be men, non-white, younger, single, dual
   Medicare/Medicaid eligible, less educated, non-English speaking, and not
   active on the transplant list; non-responders had longer ESRD vintage,
   lower body mass index, lower serum albumin, worse functional status, and
   more hospitalizations, missed treatments, and shortened treatments.
   Similar associations were found using more parsimonious multivariable
   analyses and after imputing missing data.
   Conclusions: Non-responders to the ICH CAHPS significantly differed from
   responders, broadly spanning individuals with fewer socioeconomic
   advantages and greater illness burden, raising limitations in
   interpreting facility survey results. Future research should assess
   reasons for non-response to improve ICH CAHPS generalizability and
   utility.}},

Title = {{Risks and rewards of using prepaid vs. postpaid incentive checks on a
   survey of physicians}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{OCT 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: Survey researchers use monetary incentives as a strategy to
   motivate physicians' survey participation. Experiments from general
   population surveys demonstrate that prepaid incentives increase response
   rates and lower survey administration costs relative to postpaid
   incentives. Experiments comparing these two incentive strategies have
   rarely been attempted with physician samples.
   Methods: A nationally representative sample of oncologists was recruited
   to participate in the National Survey of Precision Medicine in Cancer
   Treatment. To determine the optimal strategy for survey incentives,
   sample members were randomly assigned to receive a \$50 prepaid
   incentive check or a \$50 promised (postpaid) incentive check. Outcome
   measures for this incentives experiment include cooperation rates, speed
   of response, check-cashing behavior, and comparison of hypothetical
   costs for different incentive strategies.
   Results: Cooperation rates were considerably higher for sample members
   in the prepaid condition (41\%) than in the postpaid condition (29\%).
   Similar differences in cooperation rates were seen for physicians when
   stratified by region, size of the physician's metropolitan statistical
   area, specialty, and gender by age. Survey responders in the prepaid
   condition responded earlier in the field period than those in the
   postpaid condition, thus requiring fewer contacts. In the prepaid group,
   84\% of sample members who responded with a completed survey cashed the
   incentive check and only 6\% of nonresponders cashed the check. In the
   postpaid condition, 72\% of survey responders cashed the check;
   nonresponders were not given a check. The relatively higher cooperation
   rates and earlier response of the responders in the prepaid condition
   was associated with a 30\% cost savings for the prepaid condition
   compared to the postpaid incentive condition.
   Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that the rewards of
   offering physicians a prepaid incentive check outweigh the possible
   risks of nonresponders cashing the check. The relative cost benefit of
   this strategy is likely to vary depending on the amount of the incentive
   relative to the costs of additional contact attempts to nonresponders.}},

   intervention feasibility and acceptability}},
Journal = {{TRIALS}},

Month = {{OCT 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: Mobile Technology and Incentives (MOTIVES) is a randomized
   pilot study of a mobile technology-based and behavioral
   economics-supported HIV prevention intervention. Behavioral economics
   (BE) uses financial incentives in a way that departs from the
   traditional focus on large monetary payments. Instead, BE suggests that
   relatively small ``nudges{''} can effectively initiate and sustain
   behavior change. This pilot study examines the feasibility and
   acceptability of an HIV prevention intervention that uses text messages
   in combination with BE incentives to improve retention of HIV prevention
   information and increase frequency of HIV testing among Latino/a men who
   have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW). The pilot will also
   estimate mission-critical design parameters with point and confidence
   interval estimates of the intervention to inform a future, fully powered
   effectiveness study.
   Methods: The project will be conducted in collaboration with Bienestar
   Human Services, Inc. (Bienestar), a non-profit community-based service
   organization. The intervention is being tested in a small, randomized
   controlled trial to pilot the intervention's feasibility and
   acceptability among 200 Latino/a MSM and TGW from Bienestar's HIV
   testing sites. Information on feasibility will include recruitment,
   refusal, and retention rates as well as message sending success rates;
   acceptability will include perceived appropriateness based on responses
   to the intervention. Participants will be randomized into either the
   ``information only{''} control group (e.g. receiving text messages with
   HIV prevention information) or the ``information plus{''} intervention
   group (e.g. additionally receiving quiz questions that provide the
   possibility of winning prizes). Participants will be followed for 12
   months from enrollment. In addition to using data abstracted from
   Bienestar's routine data collection mechanisms, we will also collect
   survey data (blinded outcome assessment) from participants at 0, 6, and
   12 months to provide an initial assessment of whether incentives affect
   their level of HIV knowledge and testing frequency.
   Discussion: If shown to be acceptable, feasible, and resource-efficient,
   MOTIVES will provide an innovative way to communicate the latest HIV
   prevention information and support trimestral HIV screening among
   Latino/a MSM and TGW.}},

Journal = {{ECONOMICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{171}},
Pages = {{239-244}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Standard corrections for missing data rely on the strong and generally
   untestable assumption of missing at random. Heckman-type selection
   models relax this assumption, but have been criticized because they
   typically require a selection variable which predicts non-response but
   not the outcome of interest, and can impose bivariate normality. In this
   paper we illustrate an application using a copula methodology which does
   not rely on bivariate normality. We implement this approach in data on
   HIV testing at a demographic surveillance site in rural South Africa
   which are affected by non-response. Randomized incentives are the ideal
   selection variable, particularly when implemented ex ante to deal with
   potential missing data. However, elements of survey design may also
   provide a credible method of correcting for non-response bias ex post.
   For example, although not explicitly randomized, allocation of food gift
   vouchers during our survey was plausibly exogenous and substantially
   raised participation, as did effective survey interviewers. Based on
   models with receipt of a voucher and interviewer identity as selection
   variables, our results imply that 37\% of women in the population under
   study are HIV positive, compared to imputation-based estimates of 28\%.
   For men, confidence intervals are too wide to reject the absence of
   non-response bias. Consistent results obtained when comparing different
   selection variables and error structures strengthen these conclusions.
   Our application illustrates the feasibility of the selection model
   approach when combined with survey metadata. (C) 2018 The Authors.

   AYA is limited.
   Objective: We assessed the feasibility and acceptability of video gaming
   to improve AYA ART adherence.
   Methods: Focus group discussions and surveys were administered to health
   care providers and AYA aged 13 to 24 years living with HIV at a
   pediatric HIV program in Washington, DC. During focus group discussions,
   AYA viewed demonstrations of 3 game prototypes linked to portable

   summarize response frequencies.
   Results: Providers (n=10) identified common adherence barriers and
   strategies, including use of gaming analogies to improve AYA ART
   adherence. Providers supported exploration of digital gaming as an
   adherence intervention. In 6 focus group discussions, 12 AYA

   prototypes were modified accordingly.
   Conclusions: AYA and their providers supported the use of digital games

Title = {{A hierarchical clustering approach to identify repeated enrollments in
   web survey data}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 25}},
Abstract = {{Introduction
   Online surveys are a valuable tool for social science research, but the
   perceived anonymity provided by online administration may lead to
   problematic behaviors from study participants. Particularly, if a study
   offers incentives, some participants may attempt to enroll multiple
   times. We propose a method to identify clusters of non-independent
   enrollments in a web-based study, motivated by an analysis of survey
   data which tests the effectiveness of an online skin-cancer risk
   reduction program.
   Methods
   To identify groups of enrollments, we used a hierarchical clustering
   algorithm based on the Euclidean distance matrix formed by participant
   responses to a series of Likert-type eligibility questions. We then
   systematically identified clusters that are unusual in terms of both
   size and similarity, by repeatedly simulating datasets from the
   empirical distribution of responses under the assumption of independent
   enrollments. By performing the clustering algorithm on the simulated
   datasets, we determined the distribution of cluster size and similarity
   under independence, which is then used to identify groups of outliers in
   the observed data. Next, we assessed 12 other quality indicators,
   including previously proposed and study-specific measures. We summarized
   the quality measures by cluster membership, and compared the cluster
   groupings to those found when using the quality indicators with latent
   class modeling.
   Results and conclusions
   When we excluded the clustered enrollments and/or lower-quality latent
   classes from the analysis of study outcomes, the estimates of the
   intervention effect were larger. This demonstrates how including repeat
   or low quality participants can introduce bias into a web-based study.
   As much as is possible, web-based surveys should be designed to verify
   participant quality. Our method can be used to verify survey quality and
   identify problematic groups of enrollments when necessary.}},

Abstract = {{In response to concerns about rapid climate change and air pollution,
   electric vehicles (EVs) have been diffusing rapidly in some countries
   since the early 2010s. Many researchers have investigated the value
   attributes affecting consumers' attitudes to and behaviors around EVs.
   Little effort has been made, however, to identify the interacting
   factors in the relationship between perceived value and adoption. To
   fill this research gap, we examine the moderating effects of
   environmental traits and government supports on adoption intention.
   Using survey data collected from 285 drivers in Korea, we identify the
   significant impacts of perceived value as a predictor of consumers'
   intention to adopt EVs. Operational economic benefit and charging risk
   are revealed as the main motivators of and barriers to EV diffusion,
   respectively. We also find that environmental concern and financial
   incentives significantly enhance the effects of perceived value on
   adoption intention. The implications of these findings for the success
   of EV market diffusion are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   pharmacists in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 7}},
Abstract = {{Background and objectives
   Practice-based research (PBR) is of pivotal importance for hospital
   pharmacists which not only up-grades the profession but also improves
   the patient care. This study aimed to evaluate the attitude, perception,
   willingness, motivation and barriers to PBR among hospital pharmacists
   in Pakistan.
   Methods
   A descriptive, cross sectional study design was employed. Data were
   collected between 1st December, 2017 and 1st March, 2018 from 130
   hospital pharmacists employed in 41 hospitals of Lahore, Pakistan. A
   survey instrument comprising of six sections was designed to determine
   the attitude, perception, willingness, motivation and barriers to PBR.
   Data were analyzed by using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (IBM
   SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 21.0, Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). The
   normality of the data was determined through Shapiro-Wilks and
   Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. Independent Samples Mann-Whitney U Test and
   Independent Samples Kruskal-Wallis Test were carried out to test if
   there were differences among the characteristics of the hospital
   pharmacists. Logistic regression analysis was used to figure out the
   factors associated with attitude, perceptions, willingness and
   motivation towards PBR. A p-value <0.05 was used for statistical
   significance of differences.
   Results
   A total of 141 pharmacists were approached. Among them, 130 responded to
   the survey (response rate 92\%). Out of a maximum score i.e., 5 (100\%)
   the respondents obtained a median score of 4 (IQR = 0) for attitude,
   perception and motivation towards PBR; whereas, a median score of 4 (IQR
   = 1) was obtained for willingness thus demonstrating fair positive
   attitude, good perceptions, increased motivation and willingness towards
   PBR. The most common barrier limiting the pharmacists' participation in
   PBR was lack of time (23.8\%) followed by lack of incentives (16.2\%)
   and lack of support (14.6\%). Results of the logistic regression
   analysis revealed that hospital pharmacists practicing in the inpatient
   settings had 4.56 times more positive attitude towards PBR (OR = 4.56,
   95\% CI = 1.07 - 19.42, p-value = 0.040) as compared to those practicing
   in the outpatient settings. The male hospital pharmacists (OR = 8.86,
   95\% CI = 1.15-53.74, p-value = 0.017), those practicing in the
   outpatient (OR = 23.51, 95\% CI = 2.04-271.53, p-value = 0.011) and
   inpatient settings had increased motivation towards PBR (OR = 12.24,
   95\% CI = 1.61-94.66, p-value = 0.016).
   Conclusion
   Despite the presence of several barriers, the respondents had fair
   positive attitude, good perceptions, increased motivation and
   willingness towards PBR which is a promising finding.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{203}},
Pages = {{322-332}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This study empirically investigates the relationship between two key
   supplier performance measurement and management practices (i.e.
   monitoring and incentives) and suppliers' operational performance.
   Grounding on agency theory, a theoretical framework is proposed
   identifying the mediation effect of goal congruence and supplier
   opportunism within the direct relationship between monitoring/incentives
   and suppliers' operational performance. Related hypotheses are tested by
   applying structural equation modelling on a final sample of 305
   responses, collected from a cross-country survey. Results uncover a
   nuanced and insightful picture: both monitoring and incentives
   positively affect the suppliers' operational performance. Goal
   congruence does not result as a significant mediator whereas supplier
   opportunism mediates the monitoring-performance relationship and the
   incentives-performance relationship. However, contrary to expectations,
   providing incentives to suppliers increases the chances of opportunistic
   behaviours, which in turn diminishes suppliers' operational performance.
   While the key empirical evidence supports the general positive impact of
   monitoring and incentives on performance, incentives appear as a
   double-edged sword due to their potential counterproductive effect in
   increasing supplier opportunism.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess United States pediatricians' attitudes, beliefs,
   and perceived professional injunctive norms regarding spanking. Method:
   A self-administered questionnaire was mailed to a nationwide random
   sample of 1500 pediatricians in the US, drawn from a database maintained
   by IMS Health. Four survey mailings were conducted and cash incentives
   of up to \$20 were provided. The response rate was 53\% (N = 787).
   Results: Most respondents were members of the American Academy of
   Pediatrics (85\%), had been practicing physicians for 15 years or more
   (66\%), and were white (69\%) and female (59\%). All US regions were
   represented. About 3-quarters of pediatricians did not support the use
   of spanking, and most perceived that their colleagues did not support
   its use either. Pediatricians who were male, black, and/or sometimes
   spanked as children had more positive attitudes toward spanking and
   expected more positive outcomes from spanking than their counterparts.
   Nearly 80\% of pediatricians never or seldom expected positive outcomes
   from spanking, and a majority (64\%) expected negative outcomes some of
   the time. Conclusion: The majority of pediatricians in the US do not
   support the use of spanking with children and are aware of the empirical
   evidence linking spanking with increased risk of poor health outcomes
   for children. Pediatricians are a key, trusted professional source in
   advising parents about child discipline. These findings suggest that
   most pediatricians will discourage the use of spanking with children,
   which over time could reduce its use and associated harms in the
   population. This is of clinical relevance because, despite strong and
   consistent evidence of the harms that spanking raises for children,
   spanking is still broadly accepted and practiced in the US}},

Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{133-149}},

Abstract = {{Willingness-to-accept (WTA) questions have been largely abandoned in
   stated preference empirical work in favor of eliciting
   willingness-to-pay (WTP) responses, mainly due to perceived
   unreliability of questions that ask respondents for compensation
   amounts. This paper reassesses whether stated WTA welfare measures can
   be valid in public and private good contexts. We conduct two sets of
   laboratory experiments to analyze whether elicitation format, survey
   design and framing, and follow-up questions can generate truthful
   responses. For public goods, we adapt the existing WTP incentive
   compatibility theoretical framework to the WTA context and test the
   theory using an experiment involving voting. Results are consistent with
   the WTP literature and suggest that WTA values can be valid as long as
   responses have consequences for respondents. For the private good
   experiment, we focus on whether respondents are motivated to affect the
   price or the provision of the good. We find that strategic behavior is
   present and in the direction expected by theory. Survey framing and the
   use of follow-up questions can provide bounds on the value estimates.
   These findings raise potential concerns with the use of non-incentive
   compatible elicitation mechanisms in WTA contexts. (C) 2018 Elsevier

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Recruiting and retaining community-based pediatricians for
   teaching medical students has been explored through the lens of
   preceptors and educational leaders. The purpose of this study was to
   explore the perspective of pediatric department chairs, a key
   stakeholder group charged with maintaining teaching capacity among a
   faculty.
   METHODS: In 2015, members of the Association of Medical School Pediatric
   Department Chairs and Council on Medical Student Education in Pediatrics
   joint task force disseminated a 20-item survey to pediatric department
   chairs in the United States and Canada. Topics included demographics,
   incentives offered to community pediatricians, and the perceived value
   and feasibility of such incentives. Data were analyzed using descriptive
   statistics and (2) to compare categorical variables.
   RESULTS: Pediatric department chairs from 92 of 145 (63\% response rate)
   medical schools returned the survey. Sixty-seven percent reported
   difficulty recruiting or retaining preceptors, and 51\% reported
   high-reliance on preceptors for the ambulatory portion of the pediatrics
   clerkship. Almost all (92\%) cited competition from other programs for
   the services of community preceptors. The provision of incentives was
   correlated with perceived feasibility (R-2 = 0.65) but not their
   perceived value (R-2 = 0.12). Few (21\%) chairs reported providing
   financial compensation to preceptors. The provision of compensation was
   not related to reliance but did vary significantly by geographical
   region (P < .001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric departments rely heavily on community-based
   pediatricians but face competition from internal and external training
   programs. The perspective of department chairs is valuable in weighing
   interventions to cfacilitate continued recruitment and retention of
   community preceptors.}},

Journal = {{BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{AUG 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: Physician rating websites (PRWs) allow patients to rate,
   comment and discuss physicians' quality online as a source of
   information for others searching for a physician. It is generally
   assumed that PRWs will only be helpful for users, and fair for the
   rated, if there are a high number of ratings. However, the number of
   ratings on PRWs remains low internationally and there is currently a
   lack of research examining the reasons why patients are not rating their
   physicians. The aim of this study is to therefore identify the spectrum
   of factors influencing people's willingness to rate their physician on
   PRWs.
   Methods: A mailed cross-sectional survey sent to a random sample from 4
   North German cities between April and July 2016. Fifty participants who
   had previously used PRWs but not rated a physician provided reasons for
   why that had not rated a physician in a free text response.
   Semi-structured qualitative telephone interviews were then conducted
   with 22 interested participants to explore factors influencing their
   willingness to rate their physician on PRWs in more detail.
   Results: Participants identified a total of 21 distinct incentives and
   disincentives for rating physicians on PRWs, which could be further
   categorised under the headings: user-specific, PRW-specific and
   physician-specific. Two key overarching groups of factors emerged: (1)
   factors concerning the physician-patient relationship, and (2) factors
   issues regarding technical aspects of PRWs.
   Conclusion: These findings will be helpful in guiding future research
   and health policy initiatives to increase the usefulness and fairness of
   PRWs.}},

   care specialty. As part of a study to assess vaccine policy issues, 13
   separate surveys were conducted by internet and mail over the period of
   2008 to 2013. Surveys were conducted among pre-recruited networks of
   pediatricians, family physicians and general internists. Each network
   was active for 2 years and responded to 3-6 surveys. Physicians who
   indicated preference to respond through an online survey received up to
   9 e-mailed requests to complete the questionnaire and up to 2 mailed
   questionnaires. Physicians who chose to respond by mail received up to 3
   mailed questionnaires and a reminder postcard. For 6 of the 13 surveys
   conducted over the 6 year period, an additional mailing using a
   hand-addressed envelope was mailed to non-responders at the end of the
   usual protocol. Effectiveness of survey methods was measured by response
   rates. The overall response rates varied from 66-83\%. Response rates
   declined 17 percentage-points on average between the first and last
   surveys administered within each physician network. The internet group
   consistently had higher response rates than the mail group (74\% vs.

   Methods: This was an ancillary study to a survey of patients subsequent
   to their appointment with a physician investigating physician-patient
   communication. We randomized participants to receive or not receive a
   voucher for a coffee (costs: 1 (sic)) enclosed in the survey package.
   Alternation of groups was performed on a weekly basis. The exact

   Conclusions: A small voucher incentive to increase the response rate in
   a survey investigating physician-patient communication was unlikely to
   have an impact. It can be speculated whether the magnitude of the
   voucher was too low to generate an impact. This should be further
   investigated in future real-world studies.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction Since 2001, the Health Resources and Services
   Administration's Maternal and Child Health Bureau (HRSA MCHB) has funded
   and directed the National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) and the
   National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs (NS-CSHCN),
   unique sources of national and state-level data on child health and
   health care. Between 2012 and 2015, HRSA MCHB redesigned the surveys,
   combining content into a single survey, and shifting from a periodic
   interviewer-assisted telephone survey to an annual self-administered
   web/paper-based survey utilizing an address-based sampling frame.
   Methods The U.S. Census Bureau fielded the redesigned NSCH using a
   random sample of addresses drawn from the Census Master Address File,
   supplemented with a unique administrative flag to identify households
   most likely to include children. Data were collected June 2016-February
   2017 using a multi-mode design, encouraging web-based responses while
   allowing for paper mail-in responses. A parent/caregiver knowledgeable
   about the child's health completed an age-appropriate questionnaire.
   Experiments on incentives, branding, and contact strategies were
   conducted. Results Data were released in September 2017. The final
   sample size was 50,212 children; the overall weighted response rate was
   40.7\%. Comparison of 2016 estimates to those from previous survey
   iterations are not appropriate due to sampling and mode changes.
   Discussion The NSCH remains an invaluable data source for key measures
   of child health and attendant health care system, family, and community
   factors. The redesigned survey extended the utility of this resource
   while seeking a balance between previous strengths and innovations now
   possible.}},

Title = {{Participant Recruitment and Retention in Remote eHealth Intervention
   Trials: Methods and Lessons Learned From a Large Randomized Controlled
   Trial of Two Web-Based Smoking Interventions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{Background: Despite having many advantages, online eHealth trials are
   not without challenges-notably, participant recruitment, and outcome
   data retention. Moreover, publications from these trials rarely provide
   detailed information on the methods used for recruitment and retention
   or discuss implications of the methods for future studies.
   Objective: To address this need for empirical guidance regarding
   recruitment and outcome data retention planning, we aim to describe the
   methods and lessons learned from the recruitment and retention
   procedures used in a large randomized trial of 2 Web-based smoking
   cessation interventions.
   Methods: To ensure a demographically and geographically diverse
   participant sample, we used the recruitment strategies (1) traditional,
   (2) Web-based, and (3) online survey panel methods and adaptively
   modified each in response to recruitment success. At baseline,
   participants indicated how they heard about the study and answered
   demographic questions. To maximize trial retention at each of the 3-,
   6-, and 12-month assessment points, 4 survey modalities (first Web,
   followed by phone, mail, and postcard) were sequentially timed over a
   30-day period. Participants received US \$25 for submitting their
   responses, regardless of modality, and received an additional US \$10
   bonus for completing the Web survey within 24h of electronic
   notification.
   Results: We randomized 2637 smokers in 16 months and achieved 88\%
   retention at 12-months. Participants (79.26\% female, 72.60\% Caucasian)
   were recruited from all 50 states. The majority of participants were
   recruited through Facebook (49.43\%), followed by the survey panel
   (20.85\%), free internet sources (14.54\%), traditional media (11.34\%),
   and Google ads (3.84\%). Descriptively, participant demographics varied
   by recruitment source. Of the completed follow-up surveys, most were
   completed by Web (92\%). Retention rates did not vary by recruitment
   source.
   Conclusions: Continuous monitoring and refinement of multiple
   recruitment methods, particularly of online advertising campaigns,
   allowed us to maximize the effectiveness of recruitment strategies in
   recruiting a large, diverse sample of smokers. Likewise, offering
   multiple follow-up survey modalities in sequential order along with
   time-dependent bonus incentives enabled us to obtain outcome data from a
   very high level of enrolled participants for the duration of the trial
   protocol. These strategies may be similarly useful in other trials.}},

Abstract = {{Michigan's approach to Medicaid expansion, the Healthy Michigan Plan
   (HMP), emphasizes primary care, prevention, and incentives for patients
   and primary care practitioners (PCPs).
   Assess PCPs' perspectives about the impact of HMP on their patients and
   practices.
   In 2014-2015, we conducted semi-structured interviews then a statewide
   survey of PCPs.
   Interviewees came from varied types of practices in five Michigan
   regions selected for racial/ethnic diversity and a mix of rural and
   urban settings. Surveys were sent via mail.
   Interviewees were physician (n = 16) and non-physician practitioners (n
   = 3). All Michigan PCPs caring for ae<yen> 12 HMP enrollees were
   surveyed (response rate 55.5\%, N = 2104).
   PCPs' experiences with HMP patients and recent changes in their
   practices.
   Interviews include examples of the impact of Medicaid expansion on
   patients and practices. A majority of surveyed PCPs reported recent
   increases in new patients (52.3\%) and patients who had not seen a PCP
   in many years (56.2\%). For previously uninsured patients, PCPs reported
   positive impact on control of chronic conditions (74.4\%), early
   detection of serious illness (71.1\%), medication adherence (69.1\%),
   health behaviors (56.5\%), emotional well-being (57.0\%), and the
   ability to work, attend school, or live independently (41.5\%). HMP
   patients reportedly still had more difficulty than privately insured
   patients accessing some services. Most PCPs reported that their
   practices had, in the past year, hired clinicians (53.2\%) and/or staff
   (57.5\%); 15.4\% had colocated mental health care. Few (15.8\%) reported
   established patients' access to urgent appointments worsened.
   PCP reports of patient experiences may not be accurate. Results reflect
   the experiences of PCPs with ae<yen> 12 Medicaid patients. Differences
   between respondents and non-respondents present the possibility for
   response bias.
   PCPs reported improved patient access to care, medication adherence,
   chronic condition management, and detection of serious illness.
   Established patients' access did not diminish, perhaps due to reported
   practice changes.}},

Journal = {{DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{189}},

Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: The US is in the midst of one of the largest public health
   crises in recent history with over 63,000 drug poisoning deaths in 2016
   and a projected annual economic cost of over \$420 billion. With the
   rise of deaths and economic burden related to substance use, it is
   paramount that systemic barriers within the treatment industry be
   identified and resolved.
   Methods: Data were collected from US substance use treatment
   professionals (N = 182) in the fall of 2016. Thematic analysis with
   axial coding was used on anonymized responses to an online open-ended
   survey. Additional ad hoc testing for variance (education, generation,
   regional location, and employment) was completed using Monte Carlo
   chi-square analyses.
   Results: 7 major themes emerged: 1) additional training, education, and
   use of evidence-based practices, 2) expansion of treatment services, 3)
   increased resources, 4) stigma reduction, 5) increased collaboration and
   leadership, 6) reductions in regulations, requirements, and incentives,
   and 7) expansion of recovery support services. Participant response
   yielded a significant relationship between employment type (p = 0.002)
   and regional location (p = 0.046).
   Conclusions: Systemic barriers in the treatment field are prevalent from
   the perspective of professionals engaged in the field. While previously
   identified barriers are still present, newly reported barriers include:
   1) lack of treatment services (e.g., capacity), 2) lack of technological
   resources (e.g., technological support tools), 3) lack of recovery
   support services (e.g., recovery housing), 4) lack of collaboration and
   leadership (e.g., communication and partnership), and 5) increasing
   unethical practices in the field (e.g., incentive-based patient
   brokering).}},

Abstract = {{Study Objective: Resident education in pediatric and adolescent
   gynecology (PAG) is challenging. It encompasses patients from neonates
   to young adults with different disorders involving multiple
   subspecialties. Residents have inadequate exposure to PAG topics and
   report lack of knowledge in this area. The objective of this study was
   to determine if the North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent
   Gynecology (NASPAG) Short Curriculum improves self-reported knowledge in
   PAG among obstetrics and gynecology (ObGyn), family medicine, and
   pediatric residents.
   Design, Setting, Participants, Interventions, and Main Outcome Measures:
   Participants were 47 US ObGyn, family medicine, and pediatric residency
   training programs across a 4-month study window, from September to
   December 2016. The NASPAG Short Curriculum was distributed to them with
   a request to complete a retrospective pre-and post-test survey. Primary
   outcome measure was improvement in self-perceived knowledge after
   exposure to the curriculum.
   Results: Forty-eight programs responded to the study comprising a total
   of 1130 residents. One program was excluded because of logistical
   barriers to the distribution of study incentive. In total, 1080
   residents were invited and 103 chose to participate (10\% response
   rate); 68 residents completed all survey questions to be included in the
   final analysis. After completing the curriculum, self-reported knowledge
   improved in all 10 learning objectives, across all 3 specialties (47\%
   {[}32/68] to 82\% {[}56/68]; P < .01). Pre-test knowledge correlated
   with previous clinical exposure to PAG patients, but did not correlate
   with year of residency training, type of residency, or previous PAG
   lectures.
   Conclusion: Significant deficiencies exist regarding self-reported
   knowledge of core PAG topics among ObGyn, family medicine, and pediatric
   residents. Use of the NASPAG Short Curriculum improves self-reported
   knowledge in PAG trainees across all 3 specialties.}},

Abstract = {{Green buildings or Environmentally Friendly Buildings (EFBs) take into
   account conservation needs and use key resources more efficiently than
   conventional buildings. However, EFBs, often characterized by relatively
   high construction costs, may materialize benefits through long-term
   maintenance and energy savings. Therefore, it is essential to convince
   main players in the construction field, that investment in EFBs is
   justifiable. This paper explores factors influencing investment
   decisions of different interest groups - consumers, architects and
   building developers - in green building. We hypothesis that each
   interest group's different attitude towards EFBs may generate different
   responses to identical incentives. The study is based on internet panel
   and telephone surveys conducted in Israel. The findings reveals that
   requirements of building standards and improving professional image are
   main factors that affect architects' willingness to design EFBs, while
   energy prices increase and striving for innovation are main forces
   behind developers' decisions to promote green construction. By contrast,
   potential energy and maintenance savings, and real estate values
   increase are main factors influencing consumers' decisions to opt for
   EFBs, as opposed to a conventional one. We also find that greater
   familiarity of consumers with the green building concept increases their
   willingness to pay 30\% more for EFBs.}},

Month = {{JUN 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: Alcohol misuse is an important cause of premature disability
   and death. While clinicians are recommended to ask patients about
   alcohol use and provide brief interventions and specialist referral,
   this is poorly implemented in routine practice. We undertook a national
   consultation to ascertain the appropriateness of proposed standards for
   recording information about alcohol use in electronic health records
   (EHRs) in the UK and to identify potential barriers and facilitators to
   their implementation in practice.
   Methods: A wide range of stakeholders in the UK were consulted about the
   appropriateness of proposed information standards for recording alcohol
   use in EHRs via a multi-disciplinary stakeholder workshop and online
   survey. Responses to the survey were thematically analysed using the
   Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research.
   Results: Thirty-one stakeholders participated in the workshop and 100 in
   the online survey. This included patients and carers, healthcare
   professionals, researchers, public health specialists, informaticians,
   and clinical information system suppliers. There was broad consensus
   that the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and
   AUDIT-Consumption (AUDIT-C) questionnaires were appropriate standards
   for recording alcohol use in EHRs but that the standards should also
   address interventions for alcohol misuse. Stakeholders reported a number
   of factors that might influence implementation of the standards,
   including having clear care pathways and an implementation guide,
   sharing information about alcohol use between health service providers,
   adequately resourcing the implementation process, integrating alcohol
   screening with existing clinical pathways, having good clinical
   information systems and IT infrastructure, providing financial
   incentives, having sufficient training for healthcare workers, and
   clinical leadership and engagement. Implementation of the standards
   would need to ensure patients are not stigmatised and that patient
   confidentiality is robustly maintained.
   Conclusions: A wide range of stakeholders agreed that use of AUDIT-C and
   AUDIT are appropriate standards for recording alcohol use in EHRs in
   addition to recording interventions for alcohol misuse. The findings of
   this consultation will be used to develop an appropriate information
   model and implementation guide. Further research is needed to pilot the
   standards in primary and secondary care.}},

Abstract = {{Background Local and national policies to encourage supermarket opening
   or expansion are popular strategies for improving access to healthy food
   for residents in neighborhoods lacking these types of stores, yet few
   evaluations of such initiatives exist.
   Objective Our aim was to test whether a newly opened supermarket in the
   Bronx, NY, changed household availability of healthy and unhealthy food
   items and reported daily consumption of these items among respondents
   residing in close proximity (<= 0.5 mile) to the new supermarket.
   Design This quasi-experimental study evaluated changes in purchasing and
   consumption habits of residents within 0.5 mile of the new supermarket
   as compared to residents living more than 0.5 mile from the supermarket.
   Data were collected through street intercept surveys at three different
   times: once before the store opened (March to August 2011) and in two
   follow-up periods (1 to 5 months and 13 to 17 months after the store
   opened). This study analyzed a subset of successfully geocoded resident
   intersections from the larger study.
   Participants/setting We surveyed 3,998 residents older than the age of
   18 years in two Bronx neighborhoods about their food-purchasing
   behaviors before the store opened and in two follow-up periods.
   Responses from residents whose intersections were successfully geocoded
   (N = 3,378) were analyzed to examine the consumption and purchasing
   behaviors of those in close proximity to the new store.
   Intervention A new supermarket opened in a low-access neighborhood in
   the Bronx with the help of financial incentives through New York City's
   Food Retail Expansion to Support Health (FRESH) program.
   Main outcome measures The primary outcome evaluated was the change in
   percent of respondents reporting that the following food items were
   ``always available{''} in the home: milk, fruit juice, soda, pastries,
   packaged snacks, fruits, and vegetables. As a secondary outcome, we
   explored changes in self-reported daily servings of these items.
   Statistical analysis performed A difference-in-difference analysis was
   performed, controlling for age, education, marital status, income, sex,
   race, and ethnicity.
   Results Residents within 0.5 mile of the store had increased household
   availability of both healthy and unhealthy foods. After the introduction
   of the supermarket, the percent of residents in close proximity to the
   store who reported always having produce available in the home increased
   by 8.8\% compared to those living >0.5 mile from the store in the first
   post-period and by 10.6\% compared to those living >0.5 mile from the
   store in the second post-period. A similar positive increase in
   household availability of salty snacks and pastries was observed.
   Residents living in close proximity also reported greater consumption of
   healthy foods like produce and water, and lower intake of soft drinks
   and pastries.
   Conclusions Given the financial support at the national and local levels
   to encourage supermarket development and expansion in high-need
   communities, it is imperative to evaluate the impact of such
   initiatives. Although the findings have so far been equivocal, our
   findings give weight to the argument that, at a micro-level, the siting
   of a new supermarket can indeed impact local purchasing and consumption
   behavior. Although purchasing for both healthy and unhealthy food items
   increased, reported consumption showed an increase in servings of
   healthy items (water, vegetables, and fruit) and a decrease in servings
   of unhealthy foods (soft drinks, salty snacks, and pastries).}},

Abstract = {{Objectives Our aims were to assess the relationship between workplace
   violence, job satisfaction, burnout, organisational support and turnover
   intention, and to explore factors associated with turnover intention
   among nurses in Chinese tertiary hospitals.
   Methods The purposive sampling method was used to collect data from
   August 2016 through January 2017. A total of 1 761 nurses from 9 public
   tertiary hospitals in 4 provinces (municipalities) located in eastern
   (Beijing), central (Heilongjiang, Anhui) and western (Shaanxi) regions
   of China completed the questionnaires (effective response rate=85.20\%).
   A cross-sectional study was conducted using the Workplace Violence
   Scale, Chinese Maslach Burnout Inventory General Survey, Minnesota Job
   Satisfaction Questionnaire Revised Short Version, Perceived
   Organizational Support-Simplified Version Scale and Turnover Intention
   Scale.
   Results A total of 1216 of 1 706 (69.1\%) participants had high turnover
   intention. During the previous 12 months, the prevalence of physical
   violence and psychological violence towards nurses was 9.60\% and
   59.64\%, respectively. As expected, the level of turnover intention was
   negatively correlated with participants' scores on job satisfaction
   (r=-0.367, p<0.001) and perceived organisational support (r=-0.379,
   p<0.001), respectively. Burnout was positively associated with turnover
   intention (r=0.444, p<0.001). Workplace violence was positively
   associated with turnover intention (beta=0.035, p<0.001) in linear
   regression analysis. The total effect (beta=0.53) of workplace violence
   on turnover intention comprised its direct effect (beta=0.36) and its
   indirect effect (beta=0.17).
   Conclusions Perceived organisational support served as a mediator
   between workplace violence, job satisfaction, burnout and turnover
   intention, and it had a significantly negative impact on turnover
   intention. Therefore, nursing managers should understand the importance
   of the organisation's support and establish a reasonable incentive
   system to decrease turnover intention.}},

Abstract = {{IMPORTA.NCE. Wellness programs have become important strategies to
   combat burnout and depression among residents. However, the resident
   perspective on wellness in ophthalmic graduate medical education has not
   been solicited on a national level.
   OBJECTIVES To report on residents' views of wellness initiatives in
   ophthalmic graduate medical education and identify potential strategies
   for promoting resident wellness.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this national survey of
   ophthalmology residents in the United States, conducted from September
   21 to November 3, 2017, all 1048 ophthalmology residents listed on the
   websites of ophthalmology residency programs accredited by the
   Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education were emailed an
   anonymous online survey consisting of 12 multiple-choice questions with
   options for free-text answers. Residents also received a mailed letter
   with a survey link and a \$1 incentive, as well as 2 reminder emails.
   Survey responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and the
   free-text answers were categorized.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Main outcomes include residents' reports
   regarding their personal experiences with wellness during residency,
   support systems provided by their programs, and opportunities for
   improving wellness in ophthalmic graduate medical education. RESULTS Of
   1048 residents, 241 (23.0\%) responded to the survey. Most respondents
   (121 of 177 {[}68.4\%]) reported that their programs faced an issue
   involving depression, burnout, or suicide among residents within the
   past year; 26.3\% of respondents (61 of 232) reported being involved in
   a case when resident fatigue, burnout, or depression adversely affected
   a medical outcome or judgment. Fewer than half of the respondents (110
   of 241 {[}45.6\%]) reported that their residency programs placed
   moderate or major emphasis on promoting a culture of resident wellness,
   and only 26.7\% (63 of 236) reported that their department had a formal
   resident wellness program. The most commonly cited barrier to resident
   wellness (59 of 236 {[}25.0\%]) was a lack of time to attend wellness
   programs.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These results suggest that there is a
   substantial burden of burnout and depression among US ophthalmology
   residents and that there are opportunities to boost wellness in
   ophthalmic graduate medical education by making wellness curricula more
   accessible to residents and ensuring that residents have time to attend
   wellness programs.}},

Title = {{Factors affecting homebuyers' willingness to pay green building price
   premium: Evidence from a nationwide survey in Israel}},
Journal = {{BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{137}},
Pages = {{280-291}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Green buildings (GBs) bring multiple benefits to homebuyers. However,
   the lack of knowledge or uncertainty about these benefits, combined with
   a nominal price premium (PP) for GBs, may prevent prospective homebuyers
   from entering the GB market. Therefore, governmental incentives may be
   needed. The present study serves the dual purpose of examining the PP
   size that prospective homebuyers in Israel are willing to pay (WTP) for
   GBs, and investigating, for the first time, the potential impact of
   prevalent GB policy instruments on the premium's size. Findings from a
   nationwide online survey indicate an acceptable PP in the range of
   7-10\%. Expected maintenance savings and familiarity with GB concept and
   benefits are found to be positively associated with the size of the
   premium, while counterintuitively, financial incentives, such as tax
   breaks and subsidized loans, are found to result in lesser, rather than
   greater, WTP PP. This indicates that financial incentives to homebuyers
   may be counterproductive by generating emotive and opposite responses,
   and that a long-term governmental commitment to support GB maintenance
   may be more effective. The study suggests a mix of financial and
   non-financial GB incentives to homebuyers. The study mainly contributes
   to better-understanding of how potential homebuyers' GB choice can be
   encouraged by applying informed policy tools. It also emphasizes the
   importance of evaluating unexpected consequences of future interventions
   in the GB market.}},

Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Environmental benefits of riparian forest buffers (trees located along
   streams) are well documented, yet an understanding of factors
   influencing landowner adoption on properties adjacent to agricultural
   fields is limited. Reasons for adoption and non-adoption were examined
   using survey data collected from landowners in Kansas' Tuttle Creek
   Reservoir watershed, an area of high concern for water quality and
   quantity. Survey questionnaires focused on four latent adoption factors:
   attitudes toward trees, economic motivation, knowledge of riparian
   forest buffer benefits, and perceptions of government-funded incentive
   programs. Responses were analyzed with Spearman's correlation
   coefficient to determine whether relationships existed between landowner
   type and each latent adoption factor, Cronbach's alpha for scale
   reliability, and the Mann-Whitney U test for differences between
   adopters and non-adopters. Significant differences between landowner
   types were revealed indicating that riparian forest buffers were not
   likely to be adopted if landowners had unfavorable attitudes toward
   trees, were motivated by economic factors, were unaware of riparian
   forest buffer benefits, or had negative perceptions of the current
   design of government payment programs for establishing trees in riparian
   areas. The following themes were identified for their potential to
   increase adoption: riparian forest buffers need to be perceived as
   profitable; opportunities exist for education; financial and technical
   resources represent major constraints to riparian forest buffer
   adoption; and there is an apparent need to create awareness of financial
   assistance programs.}},

Journal = {{OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT}},

Volume = {{158}},

Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Aquaculture is one of the most dynamic food production systems in the
   world, with a fast expansion, especially in developing countries. Among
   this sector, the Chilean mussel industry has experienced a substantial
   increase, turning Chile into one of the leading producers and global
   exporters of mussels. Among the different links in the mussel production
   chain, the natural seed collection conducted by artisanal fishers of
   southern Chile has been a fundamental pillar for the development of the
   industry. Often, this sub-sector has been thought of as a homogeneous
   group, with similar responses to different challenges and public
   policies. However, this is likely an unrealistic assumption, making it
   necessary to understand the complexity of the local context and the
   heterogeneity of producer groups within the territory. Using surveys and
   multivariate statistical analysis, we explore typologies of artisanal
   mussel seed producers in southern Chile. The results proposed four seed
   producer entrepreneur typologies associated mainly with socioeconomic
   features and their interactions with the environment. These variables
   explain heterogeneity in organizational structures and equipment.
   Spatial location and environmental conditions are important factors that
   directly or indirectly influence the fishers' investment in equipment
   and sales contracts. Our findings suggest that seed producer
   heterogeneity should be considered when designing, implementing, and
   providing policy incentives to support sustainable mussel aquaculture.
   Our results identified groups of fishers whose entrepreneurship capacity
   is vulnerable to environmental and market changes, informing future
   needs for technical assistance and support.}},

Volume = {{147}},
Pages = {{312-321}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The expansion of agricultural land remains one of the main drivers of
   deforestation in tropical regions. Stronger land property rights could
   possibly enable farmers to increase input intensity and productivity on
   the already cultivated land, thus reducing incentives to expand their
   farms by deforesting additional land. This hypothesis is tested with
   data from a panel survey of farm households in Sumatra. The survey data
   are combined with satellite imageries to account for spatial patterns,
   such as historical forest locations. Results show that plots for which
   farmers hold formal land titles are cultivated more intensively and are
   more productive than untitled plots. However, due to land policy
   restrictions, farmers located at the historic forest margins often do
   not hold formal titles. Without land titles, these farmers are less able
   to intensify and more likely to expand into the surrounding forest land
   to increase agricultural output. Indeed, forest closeness and past
   deforestation activities by households are found to be positively
   associated with current farm size. In addition to improving farmer's
   access to land titles for non-forest land, better recognition of
   customary land rights and more effective protection of forest land
   without recognized claims could be useful policy responses.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Incentive spirometry (IS) is widely used to prevent

   effectiveness data and a lack of standardized use protocols. We sought
   to evaluate health care professionals' perspectives on IS effectiveness
   and use procedures. METHODS: An online survey was distributed via social
   media and newsletters to relevant national nursing and respiratory care
   societies. Attitudes concerning IS were compared between the American
   Association for Respiratory Care (AARC) and the nursing societies.
   RESULTS: A total of 1,681 responses (83.8\% completion rate) were
   received. The clear majority of these respondents agreed that IS is
   essential to patient care (92.7\%), improves pulmonary function
   (92.0\%), improves inspiratory capacity (93.0\%), helps to prevent
   (96.6\%) and to reverse (90.0\%) atelectasis, helps to prevent (92.5\%)
   and to reverse (68.4\%) pneumonia, and is as effective as early
   ambulation (74.0\%), deep-breathing exercises (88.2\%), and directed
   coughing (79.8\%). Furthermore, most health care professionals believed
   that IS should be used routinely preoperatively (78.1\%) and
   postoperatively (91.1\%), used every hour (59.8\%), used for an average
   of 9.6 (95\% CI 9.3-9.9) breaths per session, used to achieve breath
   holds of 7.8 (95\% CI 7.4-8.2) s, used to reach an initial target
   inspiratory volume of 1,288.5 (95\% CI 1,253.8-1,323.2) mL, and used to
   achieve a daily inspiratory volume improvement of 525.6 (95\% CI
   489.8-561.4) mL. Of all respondents, 89.6\% believed they received
   adequate IS education and training. Respondents from the AARC endorsed
   significantly less agreement relative to the nursing societies on most
   parameters for IS utility. CONCLUSIONS: There was a major discrepancy
   between health care professionals' beliefs and the published clinical
   effectiveness data supporting IS. Despite reported adequate education on
   IS, variability in what health care professionals believed to be
   appropriate use underscores the literature's lack of standardization and

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Patient adherence is a critical factor for success of
   patient-administered therapies, including incentive spirometry (IS).
   Patient adherence with IS is not known, so we sought to evaluate
   providers' perspectives on the current state of IS adherence and
   elucidate possible factors hindering patient adherence. METHODS:
   Respiratory therapists (RTs) and nurses across the United States were
   surveyed via social media and online newsletters. Surveys were
   distributed to the relevant national RT and nursing societies: the
   American Association for Respiratory Care, the Academy of
   Medical-Surgical Nurses, the American Society of Peri-Anesthesia Nurses,
   and the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses. RESULTS: Responses
   from 1,681 (83.8\% completion rate) RTs and nurses were received. The
   clear majority of all providers agreed that patient adherence is poor
   (86.0\%; 1,416 of 1,647 respondents) and should be improved (95.4\%;
   1,551 of 1,626 respondents). Providers believe that IS adherence is
   hindered by various factors. The most common reasons cited were that
   patients forget to use their ISs (83.5\%; 1,404 of 1,681 respondents),
   do not use them effectively (74.4\%; 1,251 of 1,681 respondents), and do
   not use them frequently enough (70.7\%; 1,188 of 1,681 respondents).
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings from a large national survey of health care

Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{There has been an increased demand by some sections of society for
   higher farm animal welfare standards. In response, a number of
   programmes marketing products of animal origin, produced under higher
   animal welfare standards, have been established on the market in recent
   years. However, the market segments for products from so-called animal
   welfare programmes (AWPs) have remained small. Farmers are considered an
   important stakeholder group for higher market shares of more animal
   welfare-friendly products. Farmers' decision to adapt their production
   to the requirements of AWPs is multi-dimensional, but always linked to
   financial incentives. Since little is known about the financial
   attractiveness of higher animal welfare standards in livestock farming,
   this study investigates the perceived economic success of 579
   conventional farmers keeping livestock on their farms. The survey data
   were analysed using propensity score matching to assess the average
   effect of participation in AWPs on a farm's perceived profitability,
   liquidity and stability from the farmer's point of view. No significant
   effect was found of participation in AWPs on the economic success of
   farmers. The implications of this result are two-fold. On the one hand,
   it suggests that it is of particular importance to create further
   financial incentives to encourage farmers to take part in these
   programmes. On the other, it shows that farmers' concerns that the
   required costly and highly specific investments will pay off are
   unfounded, as farmers participating in AWPs rate their own financial
   situation as equivalent to that of their colleagues not participating in
   AWPs.}},

   response programs}},
Journal = {{ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{158}},
Pages = {{26-36}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{A key component to understanding demand response programs design is
   elasticity, which reflects customer reaction to economic offers. In this
   work, customer elasticity for Incentive Based Demand Response (IBDR)
   programs is estimated using data from two nation wide surveys and
   integrated with a detailed residential load model. In addition,
   incentive based elasticity is calculated at the individual appliance
   level since this is more effective for operations than at an aggregate
   value for a feeder. The concept of appliance base elasticity is derived
   from various contributions of each appliance in the aggregate load
   signal and the necessity of use for the customer. Results show that the
   needed customer incentive for certain loads, such as, lighting and
   washing is less than HVAC, but since the HVAC energy share in total load
   is much higher generally, it has greater elasticity. Considering the
   important role of HVAC in the aggregate load signal, the elasticity is
   studied in more detail using estimates of different thermostat settings.
   Analysis shows that elasticity of HVAC decreases while average power
   increases. To disaggregate the load signal for each appliance, a
   constrained non-negative matrix factorization (CNMF) method is proposed.
   In addition, this method is used to decompose the HVAC signal to
   identify different thermostat settings. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier

   health record {[}EHR] use, and x-ray capability); and payment
   orientation (accountable care organization {[}ACO] and capitation).
   Independently owned practices served 55\% of patients, hospital-owned
   practices served 19\%, and nonprofit/government/academic-owned served
   20\%. Solo practices served 25\% of patients and practices with 2-10
   physicians served 53\% of patients. Forty-one percent of patients were
   served by practices certified as PCMHs. Practices with EHRs cared for
   90\% of patients and could exchange secure messages with 78\% of
   patients. Practices with in-office x-ray capability cared for 34\% of
   patients. Practices participating in ACOs and capitation served 44\% and
   46\% of patients, respectively. Primary care patients in the South,
   compared to the rest of the country, had less access to nearly all
   practice capabilities, including patient care coordination (adjusted
   difference, 13\% {[}95\% CI, 8-18]) and secure EHR messaging (adjusted
   difference, 6\% {[}95\% CI, 1-10]). Uninsured patients were less likely
   to be served at a practice that used an EHR (adjusted difference, 9\%
   {[}95\% CI, 2-16]).
   Participants' primary care practices were mostly independently owned,
   nearly always used EHRs (albeit of varying capability), and frequently
   participated in innovative payment arrangements for a portion of their
   patients. Patient practices in the South had fewer capabilities than the
   rest of the country.}},

Abstract = {{The issues of energy crisis, environmental degradation, and climate
   change present a severe challenge to the sustainable development in
   China. The development of green building (GB) is considered one of the
   most popular strategies toward a sustainable construction industry.
   Apart from advanced green technologies, consumers' purchasing intention
   toward green housing (GH) plays a crucial role in the large-scale
   promotion of GB. However, which determinants significantly affect
   consumers' purchasing intention remain unclear, especially for the young
   generation in developing countries. This study attempts to investigate
   young consumers' purchasing intention of GH in China. On the basis of
   extended theory of planned behavior (TPB), seven constructs are
   identified, and nine hypotheses are proposed. A total of 241 responses
   were collected from the questionnaire survey, and structural equation
   modeling was employed to test the proposed hypotheses. Governmental
   incentives are affirmed to be the most important determinant, followed
   by consumers' attitude toward behavior and subjective norm. Perceived
   behavioral control is an insignificant determinant for young consumers
   to purchase GH. In addition, subjective knowledge has an indirect effect
   through attitude toward behavior. Environmental concern also confirms an
   indirect effect through attitude toward behavior and subjective norm
   toward purchasing intention, respectively. Thus, the government is
   implied to play a crucial role in GH promotion at this stage.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveTo assess the impact of proxy survey responses on cancer care

   Data Sources/Study SettingSecondary analysis of data from Cancer Care
   Outcomes Research and Surveillance (CanCORS). Recruitment occurred from
   2003 to 2005.
   Study DesignThe study was a cross-sectional observational study. The
   respondents were patients with incident colorectal or lung cancer or
   their proxies.
   Data Collection/Extraction MethodsAnalyses used linear regression models
   with an independent variable for proxy versus patient responses as well
   as study site and clinical covariates. The outcomes were experiences
   with medical care, nursing care, care coordination, and care quality
   rating. Multiple imputation was used for missing data.
   Principal FindingsAmong 6,471 respondents, 1,011 (16 percent) were
   proxies. The proportion of proxy respondents varied from 6 percent to 28
   percent across study sites. Adjusted proxy scores were modestly higher
   for medical care experiences (+1.28 points {[}95 percent CI:+ 0.05 to
   +2.51]), but lower for nursing care (-2.81 {[}95 percent CI: -4.11 to
   -1.50]) and care coordination experiences (-2.98 {[}95 percent CI: -4.15
   to -1.81]). There were no significant differences between adjusted
   patient and proxy ratings of quality.
   ConclusionsProxy responses have small but statistically significant
   differences from patient responses. However, if ratings of care are used
   for financial incentives, such differences could be exaggerated across
   practices or areas if proxy use varies.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Social movements and interest groups in developing countries
   increasingly challenge large firms to influence their behavior and make
   direct claims for redistribution of the gains from economic activity. In
   response to such private politics, firms seek to maintain political
   support in the localities in which they operate so that they can avoid
   conflict and secure access to resources. To secure local support and
   defuse opposition, some firms take actions that expand access to
   essential public goods, services, and economic opportunities, while
   others use targeted clientelistic benefits that reward only a few. What
   accounts for this variation? Answering this question is key to
   identifying the development consequences of private politics. This
   article explores this question through a study of multinational mining
   firms operating in Bolivia, drawing on qualitative data from interviews
   as well as an original household survey. It shows that the political
   structures and organization in the localities in which firms operate
   create distinct incentives for firms to distribute benefits in targeted
   or inclusive ways. This finding contributes to studies of the local
   politics of natural resources and firm responses to social contestation.

Abstract = {{Residential direct load control (DLC) is an important type of demand
   response designed to reduce electricity consumption during peak hours
   through utility companies' control over the operation of certain
   household appliances. Despite many benefits of DLC, customers' concern
   for losing control has been hindering its adoption. This study aims to
   investigate U.S. residents' willingness to accept two popular A/C

   or an override option, and to identify the socio-demographic
   characteristics associated with the decisions. Results of an online
   survey among 1482 U.S. residents indicate half of the participants are
   willing to accept DLC without any conditions; however, both an incentive
   of \$30 and an override option boost acceptance rates, Importantly, the
   override option is more effective than the financial incentive.
   Residents who are younger, Democrats, non-Whites, have higher education
   levels, live in larger dwellings, and live with more people are more
   likely to adopt DLC than their counterparts. Residents who are older,
   Republicans, Whites, homeowners, and live in a house preferred an

Abstract = {{Objectives: To ascertain the reasons for, benefits of, and barriers to
   pursuing the American Academy of HIV Medicine (AAHIVM) HIV Pharmacist
   (AAHIVP) credential.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study using an electronic self-administered
   survey was used. Two separate invitations to participate in online
   surveys were sent to pharmacists who practice in HIV-related settings: 1
   to pharmacists with the AAHIVP credential and 1 to members of key
   pharmacy organizations and employers without the credential. The surveys
   assessed demographics, concurrent credentials and certifications, and
   factors influencing the pursuit of and benefits gained from having the
   AAHIVP credential (credentialed population) or barriers to pursuing the
   AAHIVP credential (credentialed and noncredentialed populations).
   Results: There were 192 participants (survey response rate 38.8\%) in
   the credentialed population and 212 participants in the noncredentialed
   population. Perceived recognition as an HIV expert from pharmacist (n =
   174; 90.6\%) and physician (n = 162; 84.4\%) peers was the main reason
   for credentialing; only 20.4\% (n = 23/113) of participants' employers
   reimbursed for the credential. Common reasons for nonpursuit included
   lack of employer incentive (n = 46; 26.6\%) and lack of fee
   reimbursement (n = 38; 21.9\%) in those aware of the credential.
   However, a majority of these noncredentialed participants reported they
   would be interested in pursuing credentialing (n = 152; 80.4\%).
   Conclusion: AAHIVP credentialing is sought and maintained on the basis
   of perceived intangible benefits, such as peer recognition, over
   tangible benefits, such as increased salary and reimbursement by
   third-party payers. Despite interest, a lack of employer reimbursement
   is perceived to be a barrier to AAHIVP credentialing among those who
   have not yet been credentialed. (C) 2018 American Pharmacists

Abstract = {{The public's party-driven misinformation and misperceptions about
   politics has drawn a great deal of attention from scholars over the past
   decade. While much of this research assumes that the misinformation
   documented by survey researchers is an accurate reflection of what
   individuals truly believe, other scholars have suggested that
   individuals intentionally and knowingly provide misinformation to survey
   researchers as a way of showing support for their political side. To
   date, it has been difficult to adjudicate between these two contrasting
   explanations for misperceptions. However, in this note, we provide such
   a test. We take advantage of a controversy regarding the relative sizes
   of crowds at the presidential inaugurations of Donald Trump in 2017 and
   Barack Obama in 2009 to ask a question where the answer is so clear and
   obvious to the respondents that nobody providing an honest response
   should answer incorrectly. Yet, at the same time, the question taps into
   a salient political controversy that provides incentives for Trump
   supporters to engage in expressive responding. We find clear evidence of
   expressive responding; moreover, this behavior is especially prevalent
   among partisans with higher levels of political interest. Our findings
   provide support for the notion that at least some of the misinformation
   reported in surveys is the result of partisan cheerleading rather than
   genuinely held misperceptions.}},

Abstract = {{Energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generally aim to (i) reduce

   analyses of their effectiveness thus rely crucially on understanding how
   consumers respond to pricing schemes, taxes, and other policies. This
   paper presents an overview of the challenges faced when empirically
   estimating household energy demand. It describes the difficulties
   associated with estimating the price elasticity of demand, discussing
   behavioral responses that may make consumers relatively insensitive to
   price changes or taxes. It also surveys empirical evidence about
   non-price policies, such as clearer information or real-time feedback

Abstract = {{Purpose: To explore combinations of worksite supports (WSS) for physical
   activity (PA) that may assist employees in meeting PA recommendations
   and to investigate how availability of WSS differs across industries and
   occupations.
   Design: Cross-sectional.
   Setting: Several Missouri metropolitan areas.
   Participants: Adults employed >20 h/wk outside the home.
   Measures: Survey utilized existing self-reported measures (eg, presence
   of WSS for PA) and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire.
   Analysis: Logistic regression was conducted for 2 outcome variables:
   leisure and transportation PA. Independent variables included 16 WSS. Of
   particular interest were interaction effects between WSS variables.
   Analyses were stratified by 5 occupation and 7 industry types.
   Results: Overall, 2013 people completed the survey (46\% response rate).
   Often, availability of 1 WSS did not increase the likelihood of meeting
   PA recommendations, but several pairs of WSS did. For example, in
   business occupations, the odds of meeting PA recommendations through
   transportation PA increased when employees had access to showers and
   incentives to bike/walk (odds ratio {[}OR] - 1.6; 95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI] - 1.16-2.22); showers and maps (OR - 1.25; 1.02-1.55);
   maps and incentives to bike/walk (OR - 1.48; 1.04-2.12).
   Conclusion: Various combinations of WSS may increase the likelihood that
   employees will meet PA recommendations. Many are of low or no cost,
   including flexible time for exercise and maps of worksite-adjacent
   walk/bike routes. Findings may be instructive for employers seeking to
   improve employee health through worksite PA.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{212}},
Pages = {{1333-1344}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Understanding homeowners' renovation decisions is essential for policy
   and business activity to improve the efficiency of owner-occupied
   housing stock. This paper develops, validates and applies a novel
   modelling framework for explaining renovation decisions, with an
   emphasis on energy-efficiency measures. The framework is tested using
   quantitative data from a nationally-representative survey of
   owner-occupied households in the UK (n = 1028).
   The modelling advances formal representations of renovation decisions by
   including background conditions of domestic life to which renovating is
   an adaptive response. Path analysis confirms that three conditions of
   domestic life are particularly influential on renovation decisions:
   balancing competing commitments for how space at home is used;
   signalling identity through homemaking activities; and managing physical
   vulnerabilities of household members. These conditions of domestic life
   also capture the influence of property characteristics (age, type) and
   household characteristics (size, composition, length of tenure) on
   renovation decisions but with greater descriptive realism.
   Multivariate probit models are used to provide rigorous, transparent and
   analytically tractable representations of the full renovation decision
   process. Model fits to the representative national sample of UK
   homeowners are good. The modelling shows that renovation intentions
   emerge initially from certain conditions of domestic life, at which
   point energy efficiency is not a distinctive type of renovation. The
   modelling also shows clearly that influences on renovation decisions
   change through the decision process. This has important implications for
   policy and service providers. Efficiency measures should be bundled into
   broader types of home improvements, and incentives should target the
   underlying reasons why homeowners decide to renovate in the first place.}},

   incentive compensation systems (ICSs) to ICS satisfaction, motivation,
   and retention among academic family medicine faculty.
   METHODS: The Council of Academic Family Medicine (cAFM) Educational
   Research Alliance (CERA) conducted a nationwide survey of its members in
   2013. This study reports the results of the incentive compensation
   question subset of the larger omnibus survey.
   RESULTS: The overall response rate was 53\%. The majority (70\%
   {[}360/511]) of academic faculty reported that they are eligible for
   some type of incentive compensation. The faculty reported moderate
   satisfaction, with only 38\% being satisfied or highly satisfied with
   their ICS. Overall mean motivation and intent to remain in their current
   position were similar. The percentage of total income available as an
   incentive explained less than 10\% of the variance of those outcomes.
   Faculty perceptions of appropriateness of the measures, understanding of
   the measurement and reward systems, and perception of due process are
   all related to satisfaction with the ICS, motivation, and retention.
   CONCLUSIONS: ICSs are common in academic family medicine, yet most
   faculty do not find them to motivate their choice of activities or
   promote staying in their current position. Design and implementation are
   both important in promoting faculty satisfaction with the ICS,
   motivation, and retention.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose There are currently no evidence-based indications for surgical
   stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF) in patients without flail chest.
   The purpose of this survey was to identify patients for whom there is
   relative equipoise (operative vs. non-operative) in order to assist in
   designing a randomized clinical trial.
   Methods Members of the Chest Wall Injury Society were sent an online
   survey, in which 18 patient scenarios were presented. The baseline
   patient had >= three displaced, contiguous fractures and had no other
   contraindications for surgery. This default scenario was then varied
   based upon patient age, degree of traumatic brain injury (TBI), fracture
   series location, and number of abnormal pulmonary physiologic variables
   (oxygen requirement, respiratory rate, incentive spirometry ability,
   cough, and numeric pain score).
   Results Thirty respondents provided a total of 540 answers. Overall, the
   majority of responses were in favor of SSRF (n = 413, 84.1\%).
   Furthermore, the vast majority of responses indicated that some degree
   of pulmonary compromise was necessary to recommend SSRF (n = 44,
   90.4\%), with >= two abnormal parameters being the most common threshold
   (n = 156, 31.8\%). Decision to recommend SSRF varied significantly by
   number of abnormal clinical variables, age, and degree of TBI, but not
   by fracture series location. Patients aged 85 years old and those with
   moderate TBI were the least likely to be recommended for SSRF,
   regardless of abnormal pulmonary physiologic variables. The most
   appropriate cutoff for equipoise appeared to be a patient aged 21-79
   years old, with no or mild TBI, >= two abnormal pulmonary parameters,
   and regardless of fracture location (44.8\% consensus for SSRF).
   Conclusion SSRF was recommended for most patients with non-flail,
   displaced rib fractures. However, this recommendation was contingent
   upon patient age, degree of TBI, and pulmonary clinical status. Results
   of this survey may be used to inform inclusion criteria for a future
   randomized, clinical trial.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives-There are sparse data on the career pathways of graduates of
   emergency ultrasound fellowships. The authors sought to define the
   characteristics of graduates and their reported career paths after
   training through this survey study.
   Methods-A 26-question anonymous survey was emailed to 597 graduates of
   70 fellowships over a 4-week period. No incentives were provided for
   completion of the questionnaire. Descriptive statistics are reported.
   For qualitative data, open- and axial-coding methods were used.
   Results-A total of 336 participants completed the study for a response
   rate of 56\%. The average age of respondents was 36.4 years, and 58\%
   were male. Most graduates had MD degrees (89\%) or DO degrees (10\%).
   Sixty percent of graduates attended a 3-year emergency medicine
   residency, and 29\% attended a 4-year residency. Only 11\% pursued
   additional fellowship training, most commonly pediatric emergency
   medicine (n=14). After fellowship, 63\% (95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI], 62.9, 63.1) of graduates began working full-time in an academic
   setting, whereas 24\% (95\% CI, 23.9, 24.1) worked full-time in a
   community setting. Thirty-three percent (95\% CI, 32.7, 33.3) took an
   immediate position as ultrasound division director, whereas 4\% (95\%
   CI, 3.7, 4.3) became fellowship directors and 3\% (95\% CI, 2.7, 3.3)
   became ultrasound medical student directors. Currently, 67\% (95\% CI,
   66-68\%) identify ultrasound as their leading academic focus.
   Conclusions-Although not all fellowship graduates pursue academic
   positions, most note the impact of fellowship on their career paths.
   Graduates hold a variety of leadership positions. Approximately two
   thirds still consider ultrasound as their academic focus.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 31}},
Abstract = {{Free or subsidised mosquito net (MN) distribution has been an
   increasingly important tool in efforts to combat malaria in recent
   decades throughout the developing world, making great strides towards
   eradicating this hugely detrimental disease. However, there has been
   increasing concern in the natural resource management and healthcare
   communities over alternative use of MNs, particularly in artisanal
   fisheries where it has been suggested they pose a threat to
   sustainability of fish stocks. So far, little evidence has been
   presented as to the global prevalence and characteristics of MN fishing,
   limiting global management initiatives and incentives for action across
   disciplines. We conducted a rapid global assessment of mosquito net
   fishing (MNF) observations from expert witnesses living and/or working
   in malarial zones using an internet survey. MNF was found to be a
   broadly pan-tropical activity, particularly prevalent in sub-Saharan
   Africa. MNF is conducted using a variety of deployment methods and
   scales including seine nets, scoop/dip nets, set nets and traps. MNF was
   witnessed in a broad range of marine and freshwater habitats and was
   seen to exploit a wide range of taxa, with capture of juvenile fish
   reported in more than half of responses. Perceived drivers of MNF were
   closely related to poverty, revealing potentially complex and arguably
   detrimental livelihood and food security implications which we discuss
   in light of current literature and management paradigms. The key
   policies likely to influence future impacts of MNF are in health,
   regarding net distribution, and natural resource management regarding
   restrictions on use. We outline critical directions for research and
   highlight the need for a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach to
   development of both localised and broad-scale policy.}},

   quality directors at Turkish hospitals}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{JAN 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: We aimed to determine availability of core Hospital
   Information Systems (HIS) functions implemented in Turkish hospitals and
   the perceived importance of these functions on quality and patient
   safety.
   Methods: We surveyed quality directors (QDs) at civilian hospitals in
   the nation of Turkey. Data were collected via web survey using an
   instrument with 50 items describing core functionality of HIS. We
   calculated mean availability of each function, mean and median values of
   perceived impact on quality, and we investigated the relationship
   between availability and perceived importance.
   Results: We received responses from 31\% of eligible institutions,
   representing all major geographic regions of Turkey. Mean availability
   of 50 HIS functions was 65.6\%, ranging from 19.6\% to 97.4\%. Mean
   importance score was 7.87 (on a 9-point scale) ranging from 7.13 to
   8.41. Functions related to result management (89.3\%) and decision
   support systems (52.2\%) had the highest and lowest reported
   availability respectively. Availability and perceived importance were
   moderately correlated (r = 0.52).
   Conclusion: QDs report high importance of the HIS functions surveyed as
   they relate to quality and patient safety. Availability and perceived
   importance of HIS functions are generally correlated, with some
   interesting exceptions. These findings may inform future investments and
   guide policy changes within the Turkish healthcare system. Financial
   incentives, regulations around certified HIS, revisions to accreditation
   manuals, and training interventions are all policies which will help
   integrate HIS functions to support quality and patient safety in Turkish
   hospitals.}},

Title = {{Why are experienced users of WeChat likely to continue using the app?}},
Journal = {{ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF MARKETING AND LOGISTICS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1013-1039}},
Abstract = {{Purpose Mobile social apps permeate every facet of daily life through
   the pervasive use of smartphones. Customer retention with mobile social
   apps has become extremely important for app-related companies. The
   purpose of this paper is to explore why experienced users in mobile
   social apps (e.g. WeChat) are likely to continue using the app.
   Design/methodology/approach This study proposed a conceptual model to
   identify key determinants of continuance intention of WeChat users and
   highlight the effects of individual experience. Data were collected from
   WeChat users, which is one of the most popular mobile social apps in
   China. The study employed partial least squares regression to test the
   research model based on a survey of 295 valid responses.
   Findings Results showed that trust, which was driven by user
   satisfaction and perceived critical mass, played a critical role in
   influencing the continuance intention of WeChat users. Moreover, tie
   strength exerted a negative moderating effect on the relationship
   between trust and continuance intention. Specifically, tie strength and
   perceived critical mass had strong impacts on the continuance intention
   of low-experience users. In addition, the effect of frequency was
   closely associated with the continuance intention of high-experience
   users.
   Research limitations/implications This study addressed the issue of
   mobile social app continuance intention by providing an innovative means
   to explore the key antecedents of user continuance intention from the
   experience perspective. The findings not only prove that trust plays a
   central role in influencing the continuance intention of experienced
   users but also reveal that the determinants of continuance intention
   vary among users with different experience. The results provide insights
   into the key antecedents of experienced WeChat user continuance
   intention and contribute to the literature on mobile social apps and
   individual differences.
   Practical implications The results provide suggestions for mobile social
   app practitioners to effectively plan mobile social app retention
   practices and to set up appropriate incentive mechanisms for retaining
   users with different experiences.
   Originality/value Although abundant studies have focused on the adoption
   of media users, few studies have investigated the post-adoption behavior
   of experienced users in the context of mobile social apps. This study
   revealed the key determinants of the continuance intention of WeChat
   users and pinpointed the different impacts of these antecedents on users
   with different levels of experience. It also provides useful guidelines
   for practitioners to effectively retain users with different levels of
   experience.}},

Journal = {{SUBSTANCE USE \& MISUSE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1324-1330}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: We sought to understand how pharmacists viewed and used a
   newly implemented prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP). We also
   sought to understand pharmacist orientation toward dispensing of
   controlled substances and the people who obtain them. Methods: We
   conducted three mini focus groups. The focus group findings were used to
   inform the design of a structured survey. We emailed a survey to 160
   pharmacists who were employed in one statewide community chain store; we
   obtained 48 survey responses. Results: Focus groups findings suggested
   that, in relation to the dispensing of scheduled prescription
   medication, pharmacists were either healthcare oriented, law-enforcement
   oriented, or an orientation that combined these two perspectives.
   Surveys suggested that pharmacists found PDMPs easy to use and that they
   used them frequently - often to contact physicians directly. Surveys
   suggested that pharmacists were typically either healthcare oriented or
   mixed (combined perspectives). Pharmacist orientation was associated
   with the frequency with which they counseled patients about medication
   risk and the frequency with which they used the PDMP as the basis for
   contacting prescribers. Conclusions: Ongoing tracking of pharmacists'
   use of PDMPs is important both at the implementation stage and as PDMPs
   develop over time. The orientation construct developed here is useful in
   understanding pharmacist behavior and attitudes towards patients
   potentially at risk for misuse of controlled substance medications.
   Further research on this construct could shed light on barriers and
   incentives for pharmacist PDMP participation and use and provide
   guidance for pharmacist training, ultimately enhancing patient care.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The majority of U.S. teens admit to handheld cellphone use
   while driving, an increasingly common cause of crashes. Attitudes toward
   novel cellphone applications and settings that block use while driving
   are poorly understood, potentially limiting uptake. We examined teens'
   willingness to reduce cellphone use while driving and perceptions of
   potential strategies to limit this behavior.Methods: Teen drivers (n =
   153) aged 16-17 who owned smartphones and admitted to texting while
   driving completed an online survey. Survey instruments measured
   willingness to give up cellphone use and perceptions of technological
   and behavioral economic strategies to reduce cellphone use while
   driving. We used chi-square tests to test the hypothesis that
   willingness to give up certain types of cellphone use while driving and
   the perceptions of strategies to reduce cellphone use while driving
   would differ by self-reported frequency of texting while driving in the
   past 30days (low {[}1-5days] vs. high {[}6 or more days]).Results: Most
   teens were willing or somewhat willing to give up reading texts (90\%),
   sending texts (95\%), and social media (99\%) while driving. However,
   they were not willing to give up navigation (59\%) and music
   applications (43\%). Those who engaged in high-frequency texting while
   driving were more likely to say that they were not willing to give up
   navigation applications (73vs. 44\%, P <.001), music applications (54vs.
   32\%, P <.001), and reading texts (15vs. 4\%, P =.029). Overall, the
   following strategies where rated as likely to be very effective for
   reducing texting while driving: gain-framed financial incentives (75\%),
   loss-framed financial incentives (63\%), group-based financial
   incentives (58\%), insurance discounts (53\%), automatic phone locking
   while driving (54\%), e-mail notifications to parents (47\%), automated
   responses to incoming texts (42\%), peer concern (18\%), and parental
   concern (15\%). Those who engaged in high-frequency texting while
   driving were less likely to say that following strategies would be very
   effective: automated responses to incoming texts (33vs. 53\%, P =.016),
   peer concern (9vs. 29\%, P =.002), and parental concern (9vs. 22\%, P
   =.025). The strongest perceived benefit of cellphone blocking apps was
   decreasing distraction (86\%). The predominant reason for not wanting to
   use this technology was not wanting parents to monitor their behavior
   (60\%).Conclusions: Promising strategies for increasing acceptance of
   cellphone blocking technology among teen drivers include automated
   screen locking and permitting hands-free navigation and music combined
   with behavioral economic incentives to sustain engagement.}},

Journal = {{GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{48}},
Pages = {{206-215}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Cropping system diversity can help build greater agroecosystem
   resilience by suppressing insect, weed, and disease pressures while also
   mitigating effects of extreme and more variable weather. Despite the
   potential benefits of cropping systems diversity, few farmers in the US
   Corn Belt use diverse rotations. This study examines factors that may
   influence farmers' decisions to use more diversified crop rotations in
   the US Corn Belt through a parallel convergent mixed methods approach,
   using a multi-level analysis of Corn Belt farmer survey data (n = 4,778)
   and in-depth interviews (n = 159). Analyses were conducted to answer
   questions regarding what factors influence farmers' use of extended crop
   rotations in intensive corn-based cropping systems and to explore
   whether farmers in the Corn Belt might use extended crop rotations in
   response to climatic changes. Findings suggest that path dependency
   associated with the intensive corn-based cropping system in the region
   limits farmers' ability to integrate more diverse crop rotations.
   However, farmers in more diversified watersheds, those who farm marginal
   land, and those with livestock are more likely to use extended
   rotations. Additionally, farmers who currently use more diverse
   rotations are also more likely to plan to use crop rotations as a
   climate change adaptation strategy. If more diverse cropping systems are
   desired to reduce climate risks, in addition to reducing the negative
   impacts associated with industrial agricultural production, then further
   efforts must be made to facilitate more diverse crop rotations in the
   U.S. Corn Belt. This may be achieved by adjusting policy and economic
   incentives that presently discourage cropping system diversity in the
   region.}},

   older used illicit drugs in the past 30 days.(1) Outpatient treatment
   delivered in community-based settings is the dominant modality for
   addiction treatment, typically involving weekly psychosocial counseling
   sessions in an individual and/or group format.(2,3) Unfortunately,
   relapse and premature treatment discontinuation are quite common in
   outpatient treatment.(3-5)Objectives: This is a pilot proof of concept
   feasibility study involving clients presenting for outpatient SUD
   treatment. This study sought to examine the feasibility and
   acceptability of the Daily Progress System (DPS), a telephone-based
   software program, using interactive voice response (IVR), designed to
   enhance quality care and improve client outcomes. Methods: Individuals
   who presented at the participating treatment clinic, who met study
   eligibility criteria, and who provided written informed consent to
   participate were included in the study (N = 15; 53.3\% females).
   Incentives were paid to participants for calls completed. Results:
   Participants completed 65\% of scheduled daily call-ins, representing
   273 person-days of data on client cravings, mood, substance use, and
   involvement in recovery support activities. The average call duration
   was approximately 2 minutes and 42 seconds. There was a high degree of
   client and counselor acceptance and satisfaction using the system.
   Conclusions and Clinical Significance: Findings suggest that the DPS
   appears to be a feasible means of potentially addressing relapse and
   treatment engagement issues based on client and counselor engagement and
   satisfaction with the system.}},

Abstract = {{Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) represent a promising solution to
   carbon emissions within the transportation sector, but relatively little
   is known about how limited-range vehicles will change consumer behavior.
   This study evaluates the impact of large-scale introduction of BEVs on
   the new car market in Norway, and seeks to determine whether BEVs lead
   to an increase in household vehicle ownership. Analysis of online survey
   responses from 4405 new car owners suggests that BEVs lead to an
   increase in household vehicle ownership of approximately 15-20\%. We
   arrive at this finding using three independent methods: logistic
   regression of the likelihood of replacing a vehicle on vehicle type,
   analysis of correlation between the rate of vehicle replacement and BEV
   market share across municipalities, and linear regression of changes in
   total new car sales on changes in BEV sales across counties and years.
   Survey responses on driving habits also suggest that BEV purchases lead
   to a moderate increase in vehicle miles traveled. These results suggest
   that real-world emissions savings may be somewhat less than those
   predicted by life-cycle analysis. Policy recommendations include
   focusing incentives for BEVs on those bought as replacements for a
   conventional vehicle.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To report on the status of residency-based wellness
   initiatives in ophthalmic graduate medical education and identify
   strategies for promoting ophthalmology resident wellness by surveying US
   ophthalmology program directors (PDs).
   DESIGN: The PDs were each sent an e-mail containing a link to an
   anonymous online 15-question survey. The PDs also received a letter with
   the survey link and a \$1 incentive. After 2 weeks, nonresponders
   received 2 weekly reminder e-mails and phone calls. Descriptive
   statistics were used to analyze the multiple choice responses and
   categorize the free response answers.
   SETTING: National survey.
   PARTICIPANTS: All 111 US ophthalmology PDs were invited to participate.
   RESULTS: Of 111 PDs, 56 (50\%) responded; 14 (26\%) of 53 respondents
   reported that their programs faced an issue involving resident
   depression, burnout, or suicide within the last year; 25 (45\%) of 56
   reported that their department had a resident wellness program.
   Respondents without wellness programs reported a shortage of time
   (19/30; 63\%) and lack of training and resources (19/30; 63\%) as
   barriers to instituting these programs. Respondents reported that the
   Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education could better
   promote resident wellness by providing training resources for burnout
   and depression screening (35/53; 66\%), resilience skills building
   (38/53; 72\%), and wellness program development (36/53; 68\%).
   CONCLUSIONS: This survey suggests that there is a substantial burden of
   burnout and depression among residents in ophthalmic graduate medical
   education and that this burden can be addressed by promoting the
   training of educators to recognize the signs of burnout and depression,
   and providing resources to develop and expand formal wellness programs.

Abstract = {{Out-of-class learning with technology comprises an essential context of

   experiences, with different incentives and different emotional and
   behavioral manifestations, were identified based on the interview
   responses of 21 university foreign language learners. Structural
   equation modeling analysis of 439 survey responses indicated that the
   three types of technological experiences were influenced differently by
   various attitudinal and support factors. Instruction-oriented
   technological experiences were influenced the most by learners'
   perception of the usefulness of the technological experience for
   language learning, and entertainment-and information-oriented
   technological experiences were the only technological experiences that
   were influenced directly by perceived ease of the technological
   experience for language learning. Social-oriented technological
   experiences were influenced by myriad factors. Furthermore, it was found
   that the influencing factors for these experiences varied for learners

   Testing the extended parallel process model}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{32-47}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - A planet that can no longer sustain life is a frightening
   thought - and one that is often present in mass media messages.
   Therefore, this study aims to test the components of a classic fear
   appeal theory, the extended parallel process model (EPPM) and to
   determine how well its constructs predict sustainability behavioral
   intentions. This study also strove to uncover students' motivations and
   attitudes that are not present in the EPPM.
   Design/methodology/approach - An online survey of 779 college students
   was conducted.
   Findings - Results reveal that both threat and efficacy are significant
   predictors of behavioral intention, consistent with the EPPM. However,
   an analysis of open-ended comments reveals that subjective normative
   influence and incentives also play a key role in students performing
   future sustainable behaviors.
   Practical implications - These findings provide a framework to educators
   and message designers of sustainability groups on college campuses
   highlighting the importance of including multiple constructs in their
   messages to students. Threatening messages will not be enough to
   increase behavioral intentions. Fear inducing messages must be combined
   with messages to increase self-and response efficacy. Education is also
   not the only piece of the puzzle. Students state difficulty in
   performing some sustainable behaviors as a key barrier, indicating a
   need to incorporate infrastructure changes at campuses to facilitate
   greater ease among students to act sustainably.
   Originality value - This study tests the EPPM's utility in helping to
   find the most effective ways to influence college students' future
   behavioral intentions toward acting sustainably.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundPrimary care physicians (PCPs) are essential for healthcare
   delivery but can be difficult to recruit to health research. Low
   response rates may impact the quality and value of data collected. This
   paper outlines participant and study design factors associated with
   increased response rates among PCPs invited to participate in a
   qualitative study at Sydney Children's Hospital, Australia.
   ProcedureWe invited 160 PCPs by post, who were nominated by their
   childhood cancer patients in a survey study. We followed-up by
   telephone, email, or fax 2weeks later.
   ResultsWithout any follow-up, 32 PCPs opted in to the study. With
   follow-up, a further 42 PCPs opted in, with email appearing to be the
   most effective method, yielding a total of 74 PCPs opting in (46.3\%).
   We reached data saturation after 51 interviews. On average, it took 34.6
   days from mail-out to interview completion. Nonrespondents were more
   likely to be male (P=0.013). No survivor-related factors significantly
   influenced PCPs' likelihood of participating. Almost double the number
   of interviews were successfully completed if scheduled via email versus
   phone. Those requiring no follow-up did not differ significantly to late
   respondents in demographic/survivor-related characteristics.
   ConclusionPCP factors associated with higher opt in rates, and early
   responses, may be of interest to others considering engaging PCPs and/or
   their patients in cancer-related research, particularly qualitative or
   mixed-methods studies. Study resources may be best allocated to email
   follow-up, incentives, and personalization of study documents linking
   PCPs to patients. These efforts may improve PCP participation and the
   representativeness of study findings.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyses doctors' supply of after-hours care (AHC), and how
   it is affected by personal and family circumstances as well as the
   earnings structure. We use detailed survey data from a large sample of
   Australian General Practitioners (GPs) to estimate a structural,
   discrete choice model of labour supply and AHC. This allows us to
   jointly model GPs' decisions on the number of daytime-weekday working
   hours and the probability of providing AHC. We simulate GPs' labour
   supply responses to an increase in hourly earnings, both in a
   daytime-weekday setting and for AHC. GPs increase their daytime-weekday
   working hours if their hourly earnings in this setting increase, but
   only to a very small extent. GPs are somewhat more likely to provide AHC
   if their hourly earnings in that setting increase, but again, the effect
   is very small and only evident in some subgroups. Moreover, higher
   earnings in weekday-daytime practice reduce the probability of providing
   AHC, particularly for men. Increasing GPs' earnings appears to be at
   best relatively ineffective in encouraging increased provision of AHC
   and may even prove harmful if incentives are not well targeted.

Abstract = {{With proliferation of web surveys, the relative affordability of

   nonprobability methods are increasingly being considered by researchers
   and government offices alike. However, research needs to more fully
   understand how the demographic characteristics of respondents may depend
   heavily on the source of sample, mode of recruitment, and context of the
   survey experience. As a first step in exploring the potential
   implications of recruitment source on response quality, we use data from
   a web survey fielded in 2013 to compare data quality indicators in
   survey data from the two recruitment platforms (Google and Facebook
   advertisements). In so doing, taking into account demographic
   differences that may arise from various steps in the recruitment
   process, we explore the effect of demographics, device and technology
   usage, incentives, and recruitment platform on data quality and response
   strategy. Our results show differences between platforms in
   comparability to national benchmarks, breakoffs, completion time,
   nonsubstantive answers, and numeric response strategies. Importantly,
   some variation in substantive responses was explained by demographic
   differences related to mobile device usage, which varied by recruitment
   platform. With the use of nonprobability samples on the rise, future
   work should build from these results to more directly assess the role of
   recruitment source in data quality.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we focused on summarizing the principles of green marketing

   In order to prove the relationship between the implementation of green

Abstract = {{ObjectivesResponse rates to health-related surveys are declining. This
   study tested two strategies to improve the response rate to a health
   psychology survey mailed through English general practices: (1) sending
   a shortened questionnaire and (2) offering a monetary incentive to
   return a completed questionnaire.
   DesignRandomized controlled trial.
   MethodsAdults (n=4,241) aged 45-59years, from four General Practices in
   South-East England, were mailed a survey on attitudes towards bowel
   cancer screening. Using a 2x4 factorial design, participants were
   randomized to receive a short' (four A4 pages) or a long' (seven A4
   pages) questionnaire, and one of four monetary incentives to return a
   completed questionnaire - (1) no monetary incentive, (2) 2.50 shop
   voucher, (3) 5.00 shop voucher, and (4) inclusion in a 250 shop voucher
   prize draw. Age, gender, and area-level deprivation were obtained from
   the General Practices.
   ResultsThe overall response rate was 41\% (n=1,589). Response to the
   short' questionnaire (42\%) was not significantly different from the
   long' questionnaire (40\%). The 2.50 incentive (43\%) significantly
   improved response rates in univariate analyses, and remained significant
   after controlling for age, gender, area-level deprivation, and
   questionnaire length. The 5.00 (42\%) and 250 prize draw (41\%)
   incentives had no significant impact on response rates compared to no
   incentive (38\%).
   ConclusionsA small monetary incentive (2.50) may slightly increase
   response to a mailed health psychology survey. The length of the
   questionnaire (four pages vs. seven pages) did not influence response.
   Although frequently used, entry into a prize draw did not increase
   response. Achieving representative samples remains a challenge for

Abstract = {{Background: The hypothesis is that decision-making for transfusion
   varies considerably among gastroenterologists. The aim is to identify
   preferences and predictors of transfusion decision-making in chronic
   anemia.
   Study design and methods: Between February and April of 2015, a
   computerized adaptive choice-based conjoint survey was administered to
   gastroenterologists in the Netherlands. The survey included seven
   patient attributes: hemoglobin levels, hemoglobin stability, age, iron
   indices, the presence of anemia-related symptoms, cardiovascular
   comorbidities, and the number of transfusions in the past half year.
   Predictors of transfusion preferences were assessed by multivariable
   regression.
   Results: 113 gastroenterologists completed the survey (response
   rate=29\%; mean age=47 years; 24\% women). Absolute hemoglobin level was
   the most important incentive of transfusion, accounting for 42\% of
   decision-making, followed by age (15\%), hemoglobin stability (12\%),
   anemia-related symptoms (10\%), and cardiovascular comorbidities (10\%).
   A hemoglobin level > 9.6g/dL is an inflection point, where
   gastroenterologists would not prescribe transfusions. Age of the patient
   is more important in the decision-making process to younger
   gastroenterologists (OR -2.9, 95\% CI -5.3 to -0.5).
   Conclusion: Absolute hemoglobin level is the most important factor to
   transfusion decision-making. This is contradictory to transfusion
   guidelines for chronic anemia which address the importance of symptoms.}},

   of such items include questions about experiences with multiple health

   of time required to complete the interviews. We tested whether such bias
   occurred from data collected in northwest Ghana by contrasting group
   learning with individual learning. The results provided mixed evidence

   survey in the Netherlands}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},

Volume = {{203}},

Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Building energy flexibility might play a crucial role in demand side
   management for integrating intermittent renewables into smart grids. The
   potential of building energy flexibility depends not only on the
   physical characteristics of a building but also on occupant behaviour in
   the building. Building users will have to adopt smart technologies and
   to change their daily energy use behaviours or routines, if energy
   flexibility is to be achieved. The willingness of users to make changes
   will determine how much demand flexibility can be achieved in buildings
   and whether energy flexible buildings can be realized. This will have a
   considerable impact on the transition to smart grids. This study is thus
   to assess the perception of smart grids and energy flexible buildings by
   building users, and their readiness for them on a large scale. We
   attempted to identify the key characteristics of the ideal user of
   flexible buildings. A questionnaire was designed and administered as an
   online survey in the Netherlands. The questionnaire consisted of
   questions about the sociodemographic characteristics of the current
   users, house type, household composition, current energy use behaviour,
   willingness to use smart technologies, and willingness to change energy
   use behaviour. The survey was completed by 835 respondents, of which 785
   (94\%) were considered to have provided a genuine response. Our analysis
   showed that the concept of smart grids is an unfamiliar one, as more
   than 60\% of the respondents had never heard of smart grids. However,
   unfamiliarity with smart grids increased with age, and half of the
   respondents aged 20-29 years old were aware of the concept. Monetary
   incentives were identified as the biggest motivating factor for adoption
   of smart grid technologies. It was also found that people would be most
   in favour of acquiring smart dishwashers (65\% of the respondents) and
   refrigerator/freezers (60\%). Statistical analysis shows that people who
   are willing to use smart technologies are also willing to change their
   behaviour, and can thus be categorised as potentially flexible building
   users. Given certain assumptions, 11\% of the respondents were found to
   be potentially flexible building users. To encourage people to be
   prepared for energy flexible buildings, awareness of smart grids will
   have to be increased, and the adoption of smart technologies may have to
   be promoted by providing incentives such as financial rewards. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Objective: To describe the design, implementation, and consumer response
   to a coupon-style intervention aimed to increase Supplemental Nutrition
   Assistance Program (SNAP) use at a farmers' market (FM) among Temporary
   Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) participants.
   Design: A quasi-experimental trial to evaluate redemption response to 2
   coupon interventions; baseline surveys characterized coupon redeemers
   and non-redeemers.
   Setting: Urban.
   Participants: The TANF recipients were assigned to either a plain (n =
   124) or targeted marketing coupon intervention (n = 130).
   Intervention(s): Both groups received 10 \$2 coupons to double fruit and
   vegetable SNAP purchases at the FM. The targeted marketing group also
   received an oral presentation designed to reduce perceived barriers to
   FM use.
   Main Outcome Measure: Coupon redemption.
   Analysis: The researchers used t tests and chi-square/Fisher exact tests
   to examine associations between redeemers and non-redeemers; logistic
   regression was used to adjust for the intervention.
   Results: No male and few female participants redeemed coupons (6.3\%).
   Among women, those with knowledge of vegetable preparation were 3 times
   more likely to redeem coupons than were those with little or no
   knowledge (odds ratio = 3.77; 95\% confidence interval, 1.03-13.77).
   Conclusions and Implications: Stand-alone coupon incentive programs may
   not be a high-reach strategy for encouraging FM use among the population
   using TANF. Complementary strategies to build vegetable preparation
   knowledge and skills are needed.}},

Abstract = {{Those examining climate compatible development and triple-win policy
   efforts that simultaneously negotiate sustainable development, climate
   change mitigation, and climate change adaptation considerations are on
   the cutting edge of exploring why and how policymakers address complex
   social problems that require balancing considerations about multiple,
   interrelated policy issues. Enhancing understanding of factors
   underlying the emergence of these efforts can help strengthen incentives
   for action, address implementation challenges, and anticipate
   inequities. This paper uses survey responses from 287 cities and
   logistic regression analyses to explore conditions and policy actions
   associated with potential climate compatible development efforts when
   economic development, sustainability, climate change mitigation, and
   climate change adaptation considerations overlap. It finds evidence that
   potential climate compatible development efforts were present in 10\% of
   the cities studied. Adaptation was the issue most likely to act as the
   missing link when each of these other issues influenced city policy
   actions, and mitigation was the least likely. Contextual factors
   associated with these efforts included budget stress, leadership from a
   policy entrepreneur, higher college degree attainment rates, having an
   environmental department or commission, and the area of the city
   composed of water versus land. Examining factors associated with these
   issues acting as missing links revealed contradictions that highlight
   the necessity of further exploration of processes affecting the pursuit

Abstract = {{To mitigate the potentially harmful effects of nonresponse, most surveys
   repeatedly follow up with nonrespondents, often targeting a response
   rate or predetermined number of completes. Each additional recruitment
   attempt generally brings in a new wave of data, but returns gradually
   diminish over the course of a fixed data collection protocol, as each
   subsequent wave tends to consist of fewer responses than the last.
   Consequently, point estimates begin to stabilize. This is the notion of
   phase capacity, suggesting some form of design change is in order, such
   as switching modes, increasing the incentive, or, as is considered
   exclusively in this research, discontinuing the nonrespondent follow-up
   campaign altogether. A previously proposed test for phase capacity calls
   for multiply imputing nonrespondents' missing data to assess,
   retrospectively, whether the most recent wave of data significantly
   altered a key, nonresponse-adjusted point estimate. This study
   introduces a more flexible adaptation amenable to surveys that instead
   reweight the observed data to compensate for nonresponse. Results from a
   simulation study and application indicate that, all else equal, the
   weighting version of the test is more sensitive to point estimate
   changes, thereby dictating more follow-up attempts are warranted.}},

Abstract = {{One objective of adaptive data collection is to secure a better balanced
   survey response. Methods exist for this purpose, including balancing
   with respect to selected auxiliary variables. Such variables are also
   used at the estimation stage for (calibrated) nonresponse weighting
   adjustment.
   Earlier research has shown that the use of auxiliary information at the
   estimation stage can reduce bias, perhaps considerably, but without
   eliminating it. The question is: would it have contributed further to
   bias reduction if, prior to estimation, that information had also been
   used in data collection, to secure a more balanced set of respondents?
   If the answer is yes, there is clear incentive, from the point of view
   of better accuracy in the estimates, to practice adaptive survey design,
   otherwise perhaps not.
   A key question is how the regression relationship between the survey
   variable and the auxiliary vector presents itself in the sample as
   opposed to the response. Strength in the relationship is helpful but is
   not the only consideration. The dilemma with nonresponse is one of
   inconsistent regression: a regression model appropriate for the sample
   often fails for the responding subset, because nonresponse is selective,
   non-random.
   In this article, we examine how nonresponse bias in survey estimates
   depends on regression inconsistency, both seen as functions of response
   imbalance. As a measure of bias we use the deviation of the calibration
   adjusted estimator from the unbiased estimate under full response. We
   study how the deviation and the regression inconsistency depend on the
   imbalance. We observe in empirical work that both can be reduced, to a
   degree, by efforts to reduce imbalance by an adaptive data collection.}},

Abstract = {{Survey researchers have been investigating alternative approaches to

   bias or to produce more accurate estimates within the same budget.
   Responsive or adaptive design has been suggested as one means for doing
   this. Falling survey response rates and the need to find effective ways
   of implementing responsive design has focused attention on the
   relationship between response rates and nonresponse bias. In our
   article, we re-examine the data compiled by Groves and Peytcheva (2008)
   in their influential article and show there is an important
   between-study component of variance in addition to the within-study
   variance highlighted in the original analysis. We also show that theory
   implies that raising response rates can help reduce the nonresponse bias
   on average across the estimates within a study. We then propose a
   typology of response propensity models that help explain the empirical
   findings, including the relative weak relationship between nonresponse
   rates and nonresponse bias. Using these results, we explore when
   responsive design tools such as switching modes, giving monetary
   incentives, and increasing the level of effort are likely to be
   effective. We conclude with some comments on the use of responsive

Abstract = {{Background: The ESMO Designated Centres (ESMO-DCs) of Integrated
   Oncology and Palliative Care (PC) Incentive Programme has grown

   education and research at ESMO-DCs.
   Methods: We sent all 184 ESMO-DCs an electronic survey consisting of 78
   questions examining the DC characteristics, palliative care clinical
   programme (structure, processes, and outcomes), primary PC delivery by
   oncologists, education, research and attitudes and beliefs towards the
   ESMO-DC programme.
   Results: The response rate was 83\% (152/184). 115 (76\%) ESMO-DCs were
   from Europe, 87 (57\%) were tertiary care centres. 136 (90\%) had
   inpatient consultation teams, 135 (89\%) had outpatient PC clinics, 107
   (71\%) had dedicated acute care beds, and 75 (50\%) offered
   community-based PC. An estimated 70\% (interquartile range {[}IQR]
   28-80\%) of patients with advanced cancer had a PC consultation before
   death, occurring 90 days before death (median, IQR 40-150 days) for
   outpatients and 21 days (IQR 1445 days) for inpatients. 59 (39\%)
   offered PC fellowship programme; 47 (32\%) had mandatory PC rotations

   oncologists. 118 (78\%) of the ESMO-DCs reported that routine symptom
   screening was offered in the oncology clinic and 30\% of patients had
   documented end-of-life discussions by their oncologists. Most centres
   (>80\%) perceived the ESMO-DC programme to increase their status.
   Conclusions: The ESMO-DCs had a high level of PC infrastructure and
   provided access to a large proportion of patients with advanced cancer.
   The survey supports that the 13 criteria required for ESMO designation

Abstract = {{Loss of natural heritage is a problem that is particularly prevalent in
   areas of high population density. We used a survey to understand the
   factors that drive environmental behavior of landowners in southwestern
   Ontario, Canada. The survey, which contained questions about
   environmental attitude, pro-environmental behavior and demographics, was
   mailed to 18,090 rural route addresses, and we received 3256 completed
   surveys (18\% response rate). Two types of environmental behavior,
   namely voluntarily increasing the area of land set aside for
   conservation, and enrollment in a conservation stewardship program, were
   significantly correlated with a positive attitude towards conservation.
   Financial considerations also played a role. We showed that the biggest
   motivator to enroll in a wetland enhancement program was access to `more
   information on how the decline in wetland area affects them personally',
   while `public recognition' was the least motivating factor. We suggest
   that enrollment in voluntary land stewardship programs might be
   increased by providing information about the effects of ecosystem loss,
   and by providing financial incentives for participation. In a larger
   social context, outreach programs by government agencies could focus on
   improving pro-environmental attitudes, which in turn is likely to result
   in more pro-environmental behavior of landowners.}},

Month = {{AUG 22}},
Abstract = {{Authorship of peer-reviewed journal articles and abstracts has become
   the primary currency and reward unit in academia. Such a reward is
   crucial for students and postdocs who are often under-compensated and
   thus highly value authorship as an incentive. While numerous scientific
   and publishing organizations have written guidelines for determining
   author qualifications and author order, there remains much ambiguity
   when it comes to how these criteria are weighed by research faculty.
   Here, we sought to provide some initial insight on how faculty view the
   relative importance of 11 criteria for scientific authorship. We
   distributed an online survey to 564 biomedical engineering, biology, and
   bioengineering faculty members at 10 research institutions across the
   United States. The response rate was approximately 18\%,resulting in a
   final sample of 102 respondents. Results revealed an agreement on some
   criteria, such as time spent conducting experiments, but there was a
   lack of agreement regarding the role of funding procurement. This study
   provides quantitative assessments of how faculty members in the
   biosciences evaluate authorship criteria. We discuss the implications of
   these findings for researchers, especially new graduate students, to
   help navigate the discrepancy between official policies for authorship
   and the contributions that faculty truly value.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectivesThe present study aimed to determine major factors that
   influence blood donation in China.
   BackgroundFactors affecting blood donation often vary in various
   populations.
   MethodsThis cross-sectional study used self-administered, standardised,
   structured questionnaires to survey selected donors and non-donors in
   Guangzhou, China between 10 December 2013 and 25 June 2014.
   ResultsAmong the 1080 questionnaires collected, 1034 (957\%)
   questionnaires were valid for this analysis, including 602 donors and
   432 non-donors. Results revealed that helping patients (n = 405, 682\%)
   was the main objective of blood donation, and self-perception of poor
   health (n = 138, 331\%) was the main reason for not donating. Responses
   to questions raised by donors and inquiring about a donor's physical
   condition were thought to be the most important blood donation routines
   (n = 302, 655\%). For non-donors, 903\% (n = 390) expressed their
   intention to donate blood in the future, and usage of blood (n = 182,
   467\%) was the most asked question. Prepaid cellular phone cards were
   the most popular incentives. Raising the awareness of blood donation was
   the most effective way of enhancing blood donation programmes, and
   television ads and the internet were the most effective means.
   ConclusionHelping patients was the main objective of blood donation in
   China. However, self-perception of poor health was a major barrier to
   donating blood. Raising the awareness of blood donation in combination
   with multiple aspects of campaigns that target different populations
   with potential blood donors is critical. Television and the internet are
   the most effective tools for promotion of and recruitment for blood
   donation.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: This study investigates student and stakeholder perceptions
   of the role of the dental hygienist in Nepal. The impact of these
   perceptions on the professionalization of dental hygienists is described
   whilst exploring the consequences for oral health workforce planning.
   Methods: Dentistry and dental hygiene students from one dental college
   in Nepal were asked to complete an anonymous questionnaire; 171 students
   returned the questionnaire containing a mix of forced response and
   open-ended items. Quantitative data were analysed using SPSS (R) 22.
   These data were complemented with qualitative information from survey
   open questions and from semi-structured interviews with key informants
   from several relevant organizations. Qualitative data were manually
   analysed and coded. Data were triangulated to contextualize quantitative
   data. Results: A high level of positive regard for the role of the
   dental hygienist in Nepal was evident amongst dentistry and dental
   hygiene students in this college. Both groups believe that the dental
   hygienist can play a major role in raising oral health awareness in
   Nepal. The scope of practice of the dental hygienist was unclear with
   issues surrounding the scope of practice and reports of illegal practice
   by dental hygienists. Significant differences (P < 0.001) were noted
   between dental hygiene and dentistry students in relation to their
   opinion regarding independent practice and the need of supervision by a
   dentist. Discussion and conclusion: Supervision of the dental hygienist
   by dentists and issues surrounding the scope of practice are polarizing
   the relationship between dentists, dental hygienists and the relevant
   professional organizations. This could hinder cooperation between these
   oral health professionals and might lead to underutilization of the
   dental hygienist. To improve the understanding about the roles of each
   oral health professional, establishing functional relationships and
   intraprofessional education involving dentistry and dental hygiene
   students needs to be introduced. This will benefit the introduction of
   preventative oral health services in Nepal. Government jobs and
   incentives to increase the retention and distribution of oral health
   professionals should be created. The government and professional
   organizations need to consider professionalizing the dental hygiene
   workforce and formalize the scope of practice. The unique demographic
   details of Nepal require a paradigm shift in oral health workforce
   management in Nepal.}},

Journal = {{HEALTH ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{962-979}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{After a period of steady decline, out-of-pocket (OOP) costs for general
   practitioner (GP) consultations in Australia began increasing in the
   mid-1990s. Following the rising community concerns about the increasing
   costs, the Australian Government introduced the Strengthening Medicare
   reforms in 2004 and 2005, which included a targeted incentive for GPs to
   charge zero OOP costs for consultations provided to children and
   concession cardholders (older adults and the poor), as well as an
   increase in the reimbursement for all GP visits. This paper examines the
   impact of those reforms using longitudinal survey and administrative
   data from a large national sample of women. The findings suggest that
   the reforms were effective in reducing OOP costs by an average of
   \$A0.40 per visit. Decreases in OOP costs, however, were not evenly
   distributed. Those with higher pre-reform OOP costs had the biggest
   reductions in OOP costs, as did those with concession cards. However,
   results also reveal increases in OOP costs for most people without a
   concession card. The analysis suggests that there has been considerable
   heterogeneity in GP responses to the reforms, which has led to
   substantial changes in the fees charged by doctors and, as a result, the
   OOP costs incurred by different population groups. Copyright (c) 2016

Journal = {{IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Background: Patients on chronic warfarin therapy require regular
   laboratory monitoring to safely manage warfarin. Recent studies have
   challenged the need for routine monthly blood draws in the most stable
   warfarin-treated patients, suggesting the safety of less frequent
   laboratory testing (up to every 12 weeks). De-implementation efforts aim
   to reduce the use of low-value clinical practices. To explore barriers
   and facilitators of a de-implementation effort to reduce the use of
   frequent laboratory tests for patients with stable warfarin management
   in nurse/ pharmacist-run anticoagulation clinics, we performed a
   mixed-methods study conducted within a state-wide collaborative quality
   improvement collaborative.
   Methods: Using a mixed-methods approach, we conducted
   post-implementation semi-structured interviews with a total of eight
   anticoagulation nurse or pharmacist staff members at five participating
   clinic sites to assess barriers and facilitators to de-implementing
   frequent international normalized ratio (INR) laboratory testing among
   patients with stable warfarin control. Interview guides were based on
   the Tailored Implementation for Chronic Disease (TICD) framework.
   Informed by interview themes, a survey was developed and administered to
   all anticoagulation clinical staff (n = 62) about their self-reported
   utilization of less frequent INR testing and specific barriers to
   de-implementing the standard (more frequent) INR testing practice.
   Results: From the interviews, four themes emerged congruent with TICD
   domains: (1) staff overestimating their actual use of less frequent INR
   testing (individual health professional factors), (2) barriers to
   appropriate patient engagement (incentives and resources), (3) broad
   support for an electronic medical record flag to identify potentially
   eligible patients (incentives and resources), and (4) the importance of
   personalized nurse/ pharmacist feedback (individual health professional
   factors). In the survey (65\% response rate), staff report offering less
   frequent INR testing to 56\% (46-66\%) of eligible patients. Most survey
   responders (n = 24; 60\%) agreed that an eligibility flag in the
   electronic medical record would be very helpful. Twenty-four (60\%)
   respondents agreed that periodic, personalized feedback on use of less
   frequent INR testing would also be helpful.
   Conclusions: Leveraging information system notifications, reducing
   additional work load burden for participating patients and providers,
   and providing personalized feedback are strategies that may improve
   adoption and utilization new policies in anticoagulation clinics that
   focus on de-implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Farm businesses face increasing challenges in the face of policy reform
   which envisages multifunctional rural economies with objectives which
   span the environmental, the social as well as the production of food.
   This leads to uncertainties and ambiguities in the way in which farms
   respond to incentives and pressures to become entrepreneurial, to
   diversify, to become more efficient at food production and to adopt new
   technology. This paper examines these tensions in the context of upland
   agricultural business in rural Wales. Qualitative and quantitative
   results support a conclusion of significant heterogeneity in farm
   response, and highlight tensions between maintaining a focus towards
   current on-farm activity or pursuing entrepreneurial diversification, as
   well as differing levels of technology adoption in support of these
   income streams. Supported by a descriptive cluster analysis based on
   survey data, the paper proposes a new conceptual categorisation of
   entrepreneurial strategy, distinguished on the basis of attitudes
   towards on- and off-farm income generation and on stated stance towards
   current and future policy grant streams. The paper discusses some of the
   factors that may determine how particular farmers and farming businesses

Abstract = {{Due to the increasing amount of electronic waste (e-waste) generated in
   Nigeria, challenges such as consumer disposal behaviors have emerged. An
   understanding of consumers' intentions to participate in formal e-waste
   collections is key in increasing the level of participation in an
   e-waste collection scheme. The theory of planned behavior (TPB) creates
   an applicable platform for identifying the determinants of recycling
   intention. Based on the TPB, we develop a theoretical framework to study
   how influencing factors such as attitude, subjective norm, perceived
   behavioral control and environmental knowledge influence intentions to
   participate in formal e-waste collections. Additionally, we extend the
   research framework to examine whether the factors of infrastructure and
   economic incentive moderate the relationships between the influencing
   factors and intention. Using an empirical survey conducted in Onitsha
   with 384 usable questionnaire responses, we observe that attitude,
   subjective norm, and environmental knowledge directly influence
   consumers' intentions. Statistical results also show that only the
   factor of infrastructure moderates the relationship between two
   influencing factors (attitude and subjective norm) and intention. The
   resulting negative coefficients of regression for the interactions
   indicate that the introduction of infrastructure will result in a weaker
   influencing ability of attitude and subjective norm on intention. Thus,
   the implications of this study in motivating consumers' intentions
   suggest it would be beneficial for the government to provide functional
   and adequately managed infrastructure situated close to the community,
   such that it can be easily accessed by household consumers.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we analyse the effect of an incentive experiment on
   German consumers' recording behaviour on the basis of a one-week diary
   of their point-of-sale expenditure. Part of the experiment, which was
   carried out shortly before the consumers began filling in their payment
   diaries, involved consumers rolling a die with a chance of winning
   either EUR 20 or nothing, that is, they were randomly assigned an
   incentive. We ask whether respondents' recording behaviour differs
   depending on whether individuals win or lose. We argue that winners
   attach a more positive feeling to the survey than losers and therefore
   show a stronger commitment to the diary. As the incentive experiment is
   part of a larger experiment to elicit respondents' risk preferences, we
   also provide evidence on the effect of conducting up-front behavioural
   experiments in representative surveys. Our results indicate that the
   outcome of the lottery (rolling of the die) has an impact on the
   quantity of transactions recorded, but does not affect other aspects of
   respondents' recording behaviour, such as item nonresponse or rounding.
   It also has a negligible impact on substantive measures, such as the

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{154}},
Pages = {{1-12}},

Abstract = {{Tropical land use is one of the leading causes of global environmental
   change. Sustainable agricultural development aims to reduce the negative
   environmental impacts of tropical land use whilst enhancing the
   well-being of the smallholder farmers residing in those areas.
   Interventions with this goal are typically designed by scientists
   educated in the Western tradition, and often achieve lower than desired
   uptake by smallholder farmers. We build on work done in farm type
   classification and studies of factors that influence adaptation,
   trialling a suite of household survey questions to elucidate the
   motivational factors that influence a farmer's willingness to adapt to
   external change. Based on a sample of 1015 households in the rubber
   growing region of Xishuangbanna, South-west China, we found that farm
   types based on structural characteristics (e.g. crops, livelihoods)
   could not be used to accurately predict farmers' motivations to adapt.
   Amongst all six farm types identified, the full range of motivational
   typologies was found. We found six motivational types, from most to
   least likely to adapt, named: Aspirational Innovators, Conscientious,
   Copy Cats, Incentive-centric, Well Settled, and Change Resistant. These
   groups roughly corresponded with those identified in literature
   regarding diffusion of innovations, but such classifications are rarely
   used in development literature. We predict that only one third of the
   population would be potentially willing to trial a new intervention, and
   recommend that those sectors of the population should be identified and
   preferentially targeted by development programs. Such an approach
   requires validation that these motivational typologies accurately
   predict real behaviour perhaps through a panel survey approach.
   Dedicated data gathering is required, beyond what is usually carried out
   for ex-ante farm typologies, but with some refinements of the
   methodology presented here the process need not be onerous. An improved
   suite of questions to appraise farmers' motivations might include value
   orientations, life satisfaction, and responses to various scenarios, all
   phrased to be locally appropriate, with a scoring system that uses the
   full range of potential scores and a minimum of follow up and peripheral
   questions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   and 6 months, respectively, were as follows: English speakers, 58.6\%
   vs. 52.9\%, 62.1\% vs. 52.9\%, and 68.9\% vs. 47.1\%; Spanish speakers,
   50.0\% vs. 35.7\%, 33.3\% vs. 21.4\%, and 33.3\% vs. 7.1\%. The number
   of participants who completed follow-up assessments only after being
   called at 1-, 3- and 6 months was 2 (14.3\%), 0 (0\%), and 3 (25.0\%)
   for English speakers, and 2 (18.9\%), 0 (0\%), and 1 (7.7\%) for Spanish
   speakers. The number of phone calls made to achieve one completed
   follow-up was 58.8 in the English sample and 57.7 and Spanish-speaking
   sample.
   Conclusions: Adding phone call contacts to email reminders and monetary
   incentives did increase follow-up rates. However, the rate of response
   to follow-up was low and the number of phone calls required to achieve
   one completed follow-up raises concerns about the utility of adding
   phone calls. We also discuss difficulties with using financial
   incentives and their implications. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{This essay focuses on the impact of recent changes in corporate
   governance on ethical behaviour within the public corporation. It argues
   that a style of corporate behaviour-one characterized by a risk
   tolerant, even reckless, pursuit of short-term profits and a disregard
   for the interests of non-shareholder constituencies-is attributable in
   significant part to recent changes in corporate governance, including
   the rise of hedge fund activism, greater use of incentive compensation,
   and the appearance of blockholder directors. This trend will only be
   accelerated by the election of Donald Trump as President of the United
   States, because the consensus view is that `tone at the top' is a
   critical factor in shaping law compliance and business ethics within
   corporations. This essay then surveys feasible responses intended to
   strengthen the role of the board as the corporation's conscience and
   superego. Given the difficulty of reform, it predicts that the problems
   identified are likely to get worse before they get better.}},

Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{This paper argues that some women in developing countries use domestic
   labor as a tool to incentivize husbands. A theoretical model is derived
   based on the traditions of rural Malawi, where men often supplement farm
   income with wage labor. As wage labor is not observed by the wife, this
   creates moral hazard: husbands may not make enough effort to bring home
   wages. The model predicts that women overcome this by using domestic
   labor as an incentive device: they increase their domestic labor and
   reduce their leisure in response to good consumption outcomes, but only
   if they cannot rely on divorce threat as an alternative source of
   incentives. This prediction is confirmed using survey data from Malawi.
   Identification is based on the fact that Malawi's kinship traditions
   exogenously determine women's accessibility to divorce. Where divorce is
   not an option, women make inefficient labor choices in order to provide
   incentives.}},

Abstract = {{Early childhood educators worldwide all strive to improve the quality of
   care and education for young children through sustainable pathways. One
   such pathway is professional development (PD). In the United States,
   ongoing PD has been recognized as critical to enhancing practitioners'
   professional competence. Situated within the broader context of early
   childhood professional development systems, this study examined the New
   Jersey Infant/Toddler Credential (NJITC) as a case of PD. Specifically,
   we evaluated the effectiveness of the NJITC as PD by investigating its
   process as well as impact on the participating practitioners'
   professional growth and practice from multiple perspectives: written
   reflections from a course instructor and a childcare center director;
   survey reflective responses from 12 practitioners; and informal
   conversations with childcare center directors, course instructors, field
   supervisors, and practitioners. The findings revealed that having the
   NJITC coursework offered through an onsite PD model and supported by a
   state-based scholarship program provided much needed incentives to
   encourage participation. It also resulted in improved professional
   growth and practice among the participating practitioners. However, it
   is only to the extent that the infant/toddler practitioners continue to
   engage in continuous PD beyond the ITC coursework will they be able to
   keep themselves abreast of the state of knowledge and best practices
   from which to further enhance their professional competence. In light of

Volume = {{63}},
Pages = {{21-33}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Due to the increasing amount of global waste generated over the years,
   most countries have the urgency to implement effective household waste
   recycling to solve this problem. In order to develop the policy that
   regulates waste recycling behaviour, it is important to investigate on
   the external factors that may influence an individual's waste sorting
   behaviour and participation rate. In this paper, we examined how four
   possible external factors namely market incentives, market facilitators
   such as informal recycling market, government incentive and government
   facilitators influence waste separation behaviour of Hangzhou's
   residents in China. The survey questionnaire was designed based on the
   extension of an extant theoretical framework and literature review, and
   then disseminated to the households through systematic sampling in JB
   Street of Hangzhou, resulting in a sample size of 631 valid responses.
   The partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was
   conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of each construct. Our results
   revealed a significant and positive correlation between all the
   constructs to waste separation intention except the path from market
   incentive to intention. We further discussed on the moderating effect of
   the social-demographic variables such as social influence, gender and
   income on recycling intention and waste separation behaviour. This study
   expands the understanding on perceived effectiveness of external factors
   that influence residents' waste separation behaviour. The findings can
   be extrapolated to other countries to implement effective household
   waste management policies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   to Maximize Uptake Among High School Learners in South Africa: What

Journal = {{SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Background: Increasing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing in
   South Africa is vital for the HIV response. Targeting young people is
   important as they become sexually active and because HIV risk rapidly
   increases as youth enter their 20s. This study aims to increase the
   understanding of high school learners' preferences regarding the
   characteristics of HIV testing service delivery models and to inform
   policy makers and implementers regarding potential barriers to and
   facilitators of HIV testing.
   Methods: An attitudinal survey was used to examine HIV testing
   preferences among 248 high school learners in KwaZulu-Natal. Statistical
   tests were used to identify the most favored characteristics of testing
   service delivery models and examine key differences in preferences based
   on demographic characteristics and testing history.
   Results: Most learners were found to prefer testing offered at a clinic
   on a Saturday (43\%), using a finger prick test (59\%), conducted by a
   doctor (61\%) who also provides individual counselling (60\%). Shorter
   testing times were preferred, as well as a monetary incentive to cover
   any associated expenses. Time, location, the type of test, and who
   conducts the test were most important. However, stratified analysis
   suggests that preferences diverge, particularly around gender, grade,
   but also sexual history and previous testing experience.
   Conclusions: Human immunodeficiency virus testing services can be
   improved in line with preferences, but there is no single optimal design
   that caters to the preferences of all learners. It is unlikely that a
   ``one-size-fits-all{''} approach will be effective to reach HIV testing
   targets. A range of options may be required to maximize coverage.}},

Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{3, S}},
Pages = {{S279+}},
Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To determine factors that encourage physicians to establish
   collaborative practice agreements with community pharmacists.
   Methods: A 20-item cross-sectional survey was mailed to a random sample
   of 1000 family medicine physicians practicing in North Carolina. Two
   weeks after the initial mailing, a reminder was sent to physicians.
   Physicians were entered into a drawing to receive a gift card as an
   incentive for survey completion. The questionnaire collected demographic
   information, factors important to physicians for collaboration with a
   community pharmacist, and physician perceptions of pharmacist
   qualifications. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze patterns in
   the Likert scale survey responses.
   Results: Of the 1000 mailed surveys, 67 were returned as undeliverable,
   resulting in a final sample size of 933 surveys. One hundred forty-six
   family medicine physicians responded to the survey, yielding a 15.6\%
   response rate. Respondents were 58\% male, 73\% had been practicing
   longer than 10 years, and 60\% had an academic affiliation. Our results
   indicate that an established relationship with a community pharmacist is
   the most important factor when considering a collaborative practice
   agreement. At least 90\% of physicians reported that the most important
   pharmacist contributions were drug therapy adverse effect management,
   drug interaction management, medication access assistance, prescription
   counseling, and medication adherence. A majority of physicians reported
   that community pharmacists improve quality outcomes and metrics (74\%
   and 72\%, respectively).
   Conclusion: Physicians in North Carolina recognize the value of the
   services a pharmacist can provide to their patients. Developing
   relationships between community pharmacists and physicians and
   describing the value of additional credentialing in the provision of
   patient care will be integral in establishing collaborative practice
   agreements in the community setting. (c) 2017 American Pharmacists

Title = {{The effectiveness of a monetary incentive offer on survey response rates
   and response completeness in a longitudinal study}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{APR 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: Achieving adequate response rates is an ongoing challenge
   for longitudinal studies. The World Trade Center Health Registry is a
   longitudinal health study that periodically surveys a cohort of similar
   to 71,000 people exposed to the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York City.
   Since Wave 1, the Registry has conducted three follow-up surveys (Waves
   2-4) every 3-4 years and utilized various strategies to increase survey
   participation. A promised monetary incentive was offered for the first
   time to survey non-respondents in the recent Wave 4 survey, conducted
   13-14 years after 9/11.
   Methods: We evaluated the effectiveness of a monetary incentive in
   improving the response rate five months after survey launch, and
   assessed whether or not response completeness was compromised due to
   incentive use. The study compared the likelihood of returning a survey
   for those who received an incentive offer to those who did not, using
   logistic regression models. Among those who returned surveys, we also
   examined whether those receiving an incentive notification had higher
   rate of response completeness than those who did not, using negative
   binomial regression models and logistic regression models.
   Results: We found that a \$ 10 monetary incentive offer was effective in
   increasing Wave 4 response rates. Specifically, the \$ 10 incentive
   offer was useful in encouraging initially reluctant participants to
   respond to the survey. The likelihood of returning a survey increased by
   30\% for those who received an incentive offer (AOR = 1.3, 95\% CI: 1.1,
   1.4), and the incentive increased the number of returned surveys by
   18\%. Moreover, our results did not reveal any significant differences
   on response completeness between those who received an incentive offer
   and those who did not.
   Conclusions: In the face of the growing challenge of maintaining a high
   response rate for the World Trade Center Health Registry follow-up
   surveys, this study showed the value of offering a monetary incentive as
   an additional refusal conversion strategy. Our findings also suggest
   that an incentive offer could be particularly useful near the end of
   data collection period when an immediate boost in response rate is
   needed.}},

Title = {{Changing the Education Workforce? The Relationships Among Teacher
   Quality, Motivation, and Performance Pay}},
Journal = {{TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Background/Context: With a growing body of evidence to support the
   assertion that teacher quality is vital to producing better student
   outcomes, policymakers continue to seek solutions to attract and retain
   the best educators. Performance-based pay is a reform that has become
   popular in K-12 education over the last decade. This strategy
   potentially produces positive impacts on student achievement in two
   ways: better alignment of financial incentives with desired outcomes and
   improved the composition of the teacher workforce. While evaluations
   have primarily focused on the former result, there is little research on
   whether the longer-term implementation of these polices can attract more
   effective teachers.
   Purpose: In this study we aim to provide evidence for potential
   long-term impacts that performance-based pay can have on the composition
   of the teacher workforce by addressing two questions: Does
   performance-based pay attract fundamentally different individuals, as
   measured by their risk preferences, to the teaching profession? Are
   stated preferences for a particular pay format correlated to measures of
   teacher quality?
   Research Design: We apply methods from experimental economics and
   conduct surveys with 120 teachers from two school districts who have
   experienced performance pay. We compare the risk preferences of teachers
   hired under the two pay formats to test the hypothesis that
   performance-based pay attracts individuals with different
   characteristics to the profession. We also analyze teachers' survey
   responses on their preferences for performance-based pay to determine
   their relationships to two measures of teacher quality: student
   test-score gains and principal evaluations.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: We find mixed results regarding the ability
   of performance-based pay to alter the composition of the teacher
   workforce. Teachers hired with performance-based pay in place are no
   different from their colleagues. However, teachers claiming to seek
   employment in districts with performance-based pay in place appear
   significantly less risk averse. Surprisingly, additional analyses
   indicate that teachers' value-added scores and performance evaluations
   do not predict a positive disposition towards merit pay. Thus, while
   these results indicate the possibility for performance-based pay to
   attract different individuals to teaching, they do not provide evidence
   that such change would necessarily improve the composition of the
   workforce. Policymakers should take this potential tradeoff into
   consideration when considering the expansion of performance pay
   policies.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Healthcare facilities internationally have grown outpatient
   parenteral antibiotic administration services for the last few decades.
   The literature contains publications from dozens of countries describing
   systematized processes with specialist oversight and their levels of
   service provision and outcomes. Such descriptions are absent in the
   majority of Asian countries. We sought to elucidate the extent and
   nature of outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy (OPAT) in Asia and to
   consider the ramifications and opportunities for improvement
   Methods: Utilizing colleagues and their personal networks, we surveyed
   healthcare facilities across 17 countries in Asia to ascertain the
   current means (if any) of providing OPAT. In that survey we also sought
   to explore the capacity and interest of these facilities in developing
   systematized OPAT services.
   Results: Responses were received from 171 different healthcare
   facilities from 17 countries. Most (97/171, 57\%) stated that they
   administer outpatient parenteral antibiotics, but only 5 of 162
   facilities (3\%) outside of Singapore described comprehensive services
   with specialist oversight.
   Conclusions: There is very likely a large unrecognized problem of
   unchecked outpatient parenteral antibiotic administration in Asia.
   Developing comprehensive and systematized OPAT in Asia is needed as a
   priority in an environment in which the infectious diseases community is
   demanding broad stewardship approaches. There are nonetheless challenges
   in establishing and sustaining OPAT programmes. Local champions and
   leverage off identified local incentives and needs are key to regional
   advancement.}},

Abstract = {{While impacts of climate change on agricultural systems have been widely
   researched, there is still limited understanding of what agricultural
   innovations have evolved over time in response to both climatic and
   non-climatic drivers. Although there has been some progress in
   formulating national adaptation policies and strategic planning in
   different countries of South Asia, research to identify local-level
   adaptive strategies and practices is still limited. Through eight case
   studies and a survey of 300 households in 15 locations in India, Nepal
   and Bangladesh, this paper generates empirical evidence on emerging
   agricultural innovations in contrasting socio-economic, geographical and
   agro-ecological contexts. The study demonstrates that several farm
   practices (innovations) have emerged in response to multiple drivers
   over time, with various forms of institutional and policy support,
   including incentives to reduce risks in the adoption of innovative
   practice. It further shows that there is still limited attempt to
   systematically mainstream adaptation innovations into local, regional
   and national government structures, policies and planning processes. The
   paper shows that the process of farm-level adaptation through innovation
   adoption forms an important avenue for agricultural adaptation in South
   Asia. A key implication of this finding is that there is a need for
   stronger collaborations between research institutions, extension
   systems, civil society and the private sector actors to enhance emerging
   adaptive innovations at the farm level.}},

Abstract = {{The extent of United States Great Plains grass agriculture has ebbed and
   flowed over decades in response to market incentives, government
   policies, technological innovations and weather patterns. Our thesis is
   that the land most responsive to these drivers is at the economic margin
   between grass-based production and cropping. Much of the eastern Dakotas
   is such an area, primarily under crop-based agriculture although grass
   remains an important land use. We surveyed land operators in the area on
   their views about motivators for land use choices. Their views are
   largely consistent with the economic margin viewpoint. The importance of
   crop output prices, crop input prices, innovations in cropping equipment
   and weather patterns on land use decisions grow as one moves north
   toward the economic margin. Land in more highly sloped areas is more
   sensitive to crop prices and crop.insurance policies. Consistent with
   human capital theory, older operators are generally less responsive to
   factors that affect land use. Those renting more land, being more
   exposed to market forces, are more responsive. As farm size increases,
   respondents declared higher land use sensitivity to policy issues and
   technological innovations, suggesting that scale effects render land
   units more sensitive to land use change drivers. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Research investigating the relationship between physical environments
   and various aspects of quality of life have found that people who live
   or work near natural areas have improved health and increased levels of
   satisfaction at home, work, andwith life in general. Research has also
   shown that workers who performed their job function in offices with
   windows or interior plants had higher job satisfaction. The purpose of
   the current study was to investigate the relationship between the use of
   green spaces and public gardens in thework place onmentalwell-being,
   overall quality of life, and job satisfaction. The sample for this study
   was drawn from participants whowere on the contact list of public garden
   employees and volunteers for awinter inservice training hosted by the
   Smithsonian Gardens (Washington, DC). Participants were e-mailed asking
   for their participation in the survey. An incentive of winning a
   greenhouse tourwas used to improve the response rate. A total of 105
   usable surveys were received out of 423 invitations that were sent for a
   response rate of 24.8\%. Participants were asked to respond to questions
   regarding their work environment, mental well-being, overall quality of
   life, and job satisfaction. Differences were identified based on whether
   the participant was a paid employee or unpaid worker. Based on time
   spent outdoors during the workday, the only difference within the
   overall group existed with regard to how frequently the participant ate
   outdoors and their reported mental well-being. On the quality of life
   questions, differences for the overall sample, the paid group, and the
   unpaid group were found for having window views of plants or nature. On
   the job satisfaction question, differences were identified in the
   overall sample and the paid group for having awindowin their immediate
   office or workplace. Several variables did not identify any
   statistically significant difference, which might result from this
   sample being already largely connected to nature due to their employment
   or volunteer work within a public garden.}},

Title = {{An examination of the causes, consequences, and policy responses to the
   migration of highly trained health personnel from the Philippines: the
   high cost of living/leaving-a mixed method study}},
Journal = {{HUMAN RESOURCES FOR HEALTH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{MAR 31}},
Abstract = {{Background: Dramatic increases in the migration of human resources for
   health (HRH) from developing countries like the Philippines can have
   consequences on the sustainability of health systems. In this paper, we
   trace the outflows of HRH from the Philippines, map out its key causes
   and consequences, and identify relevant policy responses.
   Methods: This mixed method study employed a decentered, comparative
   approach that involved three phases: (a) a scoping review on health
   workers' migration of relevant policy documents and academic literature
   on health workers' migration from the Philippines; and primary data
   collection with (b) 37 key stakeholders and (c) household surveys with
   seven doctors, 329 nurses, 66 midwives, and 18 physical therapists.
   Results: Filipino health worker migration is best understood within the
   context of macro-, meso-, and micro-level factors that are situated
   within the political, economic, and historical/colonial legacy of the
   country. Underfunding of the health system and un- or underemployment
   were push factors for migration, as were concerns for security in the
   Philippines, the ability to practice to full scope or to have
   opportunities for career advancement. The migration of health workers
   has both negative and positive consequences for the Philippine health
   system and its health workers. Stakeholders focused on issues such as on
   brain drain, gain, and circulation, and on opportunities for knowledge
   and technology transfer. Concomitantly, migration has resulted in the
   loss of investment in human capital. The gap in the supply of health
   workers has affected the quality of care delivered, especially in rural
   areas. The opening of overseas opportunities has commercialized health
   education, compromised its quality, and stripped the country of skilled
   learning facilitators. The social cost of migration has affected emigres
   and their families. At the household level, migration has engendered
   increased consumerism and materialism and fostered dependency on
   overseas remittances. Addressing these gaps requires time and resources.
   At the same time, migration is, however, seen by some as an opportunity
   for professional growth and enhancement, and as a window for drafting
   more effective national and inter-country policy responses to HRH
   mobility.
   Conclusions: Unless socioeconomic conditions are improved and health
   professionals are provided with better incentives, staying in the
   Philippines will not be a viable option. The massive expansion in
   education and training designed specifically for outmigration creates a
   domestic supply of health workers who cannot be absorbed by a system
   that is underfunded. This results in a paradox of underservice,
   especially in rural and remote areas, at the same time as
   underemployment and outmigration. Policy responses to this paradox have
   not yet been appropriately aligned to capture the multilayered and
   complex nature of these intersecting phenomena.}},

Abstract = {{As smartphones are being replaced at an increasing rate, it becomes more
   and more important to find ways to reuse (parts of) existing phones.
   This research investigates the potential of selling refurbished
   smartphones using a quantitative study. An online survey was conducted
   questioning 250 respondents, in which the perceived consumer risks and
   benefits associated with refurbished phones were investigated.
   Furthermore, we studied the impact of various incentives that companies
   can employ to improve consumers' purchase intention of refurbished
   phones. Through a cluster analysis six distinct customer groups were
   identified. Our sample demonstrated a positive attitude towards
   refurbished smartphones, with most potential for three out of our six
   customer groups (46\% of our sample). This indicates that refurbished
   smartphones can be a market success. It was found that perceived
   environmental benefits and awareness of refurbishing have a positive
   impact on the consumers' purchase intention for refurbished smartphones.
   Most of the highest scoring incentives for purchasing refurbished
   smartphones were product-related and included improved battery life,
   guaranteed software updates and upgraded performance, indicating a need
   for continued performance. This research contributes to our theoretical
   understanding of consumer responses to refurbished smartphones and can
   help companies in launching these products successfully. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: In the current health-care environment, respiratory care may
   need to make significant changes to academic preparation and clinical
   practice. The purpose of this research was to assess current needs of
   respiratory therapists (RTs) in New York State and to understand how RTs
   perceive their future clinical and academic roles. METHODS: This study
   employed a descriptive, cross-sectional non-experimental design. Between
   October and December 2014, a 32-item online survey was distributed via
   e-mail to the 2,170 members of the New York State Society of Respiratory
   Care. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize responses, and
   bivariate analyses were assessed using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U
   tests. RESULTS: The response rate was 22\% and resulted in 435 valid
   surveys returned. Seventy percent of 415 respondents agreed that the
   practice of respiratory care is at risk of losing practitioners. The
   most important incentive for retention of practitioners in the field was
   professional growth and an expanded scope of clinical practice.
   Specifically, the most important of these roles was gaining the ability
   to assess patients, develop a plan of care, and receive reimbursement
   for services. Sixty-four percent of 415 respondents strongly agreed that
   the minimum academic standard for RTs should be raised to the
   baccalaureate level. Of 415 respondents, the majority (78\%) agreed that
   it is important for therapists to remain in the profession and to be an
   active member of the American Association for Respiratory Care (83\%).
   CONCLUSIONS: These data are useful to the profession, notably for
   academic programs that must meet the need for a more highly prepared and
   skilled workforce. The findings emphasize that viability of the
   profession in the current health-care environment calls for the
   evolution of a more autonomous RT who can be reimbursed for services and
   obtain salaries that are competitive with other health professions. (C)

Title = {{Ecological Momentary Assessment in Behavioral Research: Addressing
   Technological and Human Participant Challenges}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) assesses individuals' current
   experiences, behaviors, and moods as they occur in real time and in
   their natural environment. EMA studies, particularly those of longer
   duration, are complex and require an infrastructure to support the data
   flow and monitoring of EMA completion.
   Objective
   Our objective is to provide a practical guide to developing and
   implementing an EMA study, with a focus on the methods and logistics of
   conducting such a study.
   Methods
   The EMPOWER study was a 12-month study that used EMA to examine the
   triggers of lapses and relapse following intentional weight loss. We
   report on several studies that informed the implementation of the
   EMPOWER study: (1) a series of pilot studies, (2) the EMPOWER study's
   infrastructure, (3) training of study participants in use of smartphones
   and the EMA protocol and, (4) strategies used to enhance adherence to
   completing EMA surveys.
   Results
   The study enrolled 151 adults and had 87.4\% (132/151) retention rate at
   12 months. Our learning experiences in the development of the
   infrastructure to support EMA assessments for the 12-month study spanned
   several topic areas. Included were the optimal frequency of EMA prompts
   to maximize data collection without overburdening participants; the
   timing and scheduling of EMA prompts; technological lessons to support a
   longitudinal study, such as proper communication between the Android
   smartphone, the Web server, and the database server; and use of a phone
   that provided access to the system's functionality for EMA data
   collection to avoid loss of data and minimize the impact of loss of
   network connectivity. These were especially important in a 1-year study
   with participants who might travel. It also protected the data
   collection from any server-side failure. Regular monitoring of
   participants' response to EMA prompts was critical, so we built in
   incentives to enhance completion of EMA surveys. During the first 6
   months of the 12-month study interval, adherence to completing EMA
   surveys was high, with 88.3\% (66,978/75,888) completion of random
   assessments and around 90\% (23,411/25,929 and 23,343/26,010) completion
   of time-contingent assessments, despite the duration of EMA data
   collection and challenges with implementation.
   Conclusions
   This work informed us of the necessary preliminary steps to plan and
   prepare a longitudinal study using smartphone technology and the
   critical elements to ensure participant engagement in the potentially
   burdensome protocol, which spanned 12 months. While this was a
   technology-supported and -programmed study, it required close oversight
   to ensure all elements were functioning correctly, particularly once
   human participants became involved.}},

Abstract = {{Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is now accepted as the standard of care
   for axillary staging in women with node-negative breast cancer.
   Currently, dye, radioisotope (RI), and fluorescence indocyanine green
   (fICG) are tracers available. Importance of these three tracers has been
   recognized for SLN biopsy but the trend for SLN mapping has not been
   reported. Aim of this national wide survey was to evaluate practice
   patterns of SLN biopsy in Japan.
   This survey was conducted to examine the clinical practice of SLN biopsy
   in centers where one or more Japanese Breast Cancer Society (JBCS)
   board-certified surgeons practice breast cancer care. Their responses
   were recorded from 1 to 30 Oct 2014 and received by mail or fax in
   Japan. The questionnaire included three items: the number of breast
   cancer patients treated per year, the number of SLN biopsy procedures in
   a single year, and the methods for SLN detection.
   A total of 412 responses excluding the 63 centers that do not perform
   the surgery were analyzed. Out of them, 206 (50 \%) centers had a gamma
   probe, 118 (29 \%) had an NIR fluorescence imaging system, and both were
   available at 49 (12 \%) of the centers. Neither RI nor fICG was
   available in 137 (33 \%). The dye method was preferentially used in
   private hospitals. In 412 centers, a total of 36,221 patients underwent
   SLN biopsy per year and 23,038 (64 \%) received radioactive tracer. fICG
   was co-applied with RI in 83 and 13 \% of patients, respectively. Single
   mapping with RI alone was used in only 4 \% of patients. The
   non-radioactive method was used for routine SLN biopsy in 13,183 (36 \%)
   patients {[}8533 (24 \%) for dye alone and 4650 (12 \%) for fICG alone].
   A radioactive tracer was used in 64 \% of women with early breast cancer
   for SLN biopsy while approximately 24 \% received dye alone, which was
   especially prevalent in PHs. The fICG was used in only 12 \% as a
   non-radioactive method but incentive package for fICG by national health
   insurance plan could increase the number of NIR imaging systems and
   improve the sensitivity for SLN biopsy in Japan.}},

Abstract = {{Objective
   This study assesses dental clinicians' pre-and post-implementation
   attitudes, skills, and experiences with three clinical decision support
   (CDS) tools built into the electronic health record (EHR) of a
   multi-specialty group dental practice.
   Methods
   Electronic surveys designed to examine factors for acceptance of
   EHR-based CDS tools including caries management by risk assessment,
   (CAMBRA), periodontal disease management by risk assessment (PEMBRA) and
   a risk assessment-based Proactive Dental Care Plan (PDCP) were
   distributed to all Willamette Dental Group employees at 2 time points; 3
   months pre-implementation (Fall 2013) and 15 months after implementation
   (winter 2015). The surveys collected demographics, measures of job
   experience and satisfaction, and attitudes toward each CDS tool. The
   baseline survey response rate among clinicians was 83.1\% (n 567) and
   follow-up survey response rate was 63.2\% (n = 508). Among the 344
   clinicians who responded to both before and after surveys, 27\% were
   general and specialist dentists, 32\% were dental hygienists, and 41\%
   were dental assistants.
   Results
   Adherence to the CDS tools has been sustained at 98\%+ since roll-out.
   Between baseline and follow-up, the change in mean attitude scores
   regarding CAM BRA reflect statistically significant improvement in
   formal training, knowing how to use the tools, belief in the science
   supporting the tools, and the usefulness of the tool to motivate
   patients. For PEMBRA, statistically significant improvement was found in
   formal training, knowing how to use the tools, belief in the science
   supporting the tools, with improvement also found in belief that the
   format and process worked well. Finally, for the PDCP, significant and
   positive changes were seen for every attitude and skill item scored. A
   strong and positive correlation with post-implementation attitudes was
   found with positive experiences in the work environment, whereas a
   negative correlation was found with workload and stress. Clinicians
   highly ranked a commitment to evidence-based care and sense that the
   tools were helping to improve patient care, health, and experience as
   motivations to use the tools. Peer pressure, fears about malpractice,
   and incentive pay were rated the lowest among the motivation factors.
   Conclusion
   This study shows that CDS tools built into the EHR can be successfully
   implemented in a dental practice and widely accepted by the entire
   clinical team. Achieving a high level of adherence to use of CDS can be
   done through adequate training, alignment with the mission and purpose
   of the organization, and is compatible with an improved work environment
   and clinician satisfaction.}},

   Address It?}},
Journal = {{MILBANK QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{95}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{117-135}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Congress has expressed concern about electronic health record (EHR)
   vendors and health care providers knowingly interfering with the
   electronic exchange of patient health information. These information
   blocking practices would privately benefit vendors and providers but
   limit the societal quality and efficiency benefits from EHR adoption. We
   found that information blocking is reported to frequently occur among
   EHR vendors as well as hospitals and health systems, and that it is
   perceived to be motivated by opportunities for revenue gain. Because
   information blocking is largely legal today, the most effective policy
   response likely involves a combination of direct enforcement and the
   altering of market conditions that promote information blocking.
   ContextCongress has raised concerns about providers and electronic
   health record (EHR) vendors knowingly engaging in business practices
   that interfere with electronic health information exchange (HIE). Such
   information blocking is presumed to occur because providers and vendors
   reap financial benefits, but these practices harm public good and
   substantially limit the value to be gained from EHR adoption. Crafting a
   policy response has been difficult because, beyond anecdotes, there is
   no data that captures the extent of information blocking.
   MethodsWe conducted a national survey of leaders of HIE efforts who work
   to enable HIE across provider organizations. We asked them about the
   frequency of information blocking, its specific forms, and the
   effectiveness of various policy strategies to address it. We received
   responses from 60 individuals (57\% response rate). We calculated
   descriptive statistics across responses.
   FindingsHalf of respondents reported that EHR vendors routinely engage
   in information blocking, and 25\% of respondents reported that hospitals
   and health systems routinely do so. Among EHR vendors, the most common
   form of information blocking was deploying products with limited
   interoperability. Among hospitals and health systems, the most common
   form was coercing providers to adopt particular EHR or HIE technology.
   Increasing transparency of EHR vendor business practices and product
   performance, stronger financial incentives for providers to share
   information, and making information blocking illegal were perceived as
   the most effective policy remedies.
   ConclusionsInformation blocking appears to be real and fairly
   widespread. Policymakers have some existing levers that can be used to
   curb information blocking and help information flow to where it is
   needed to improve patient care. However, because information blocking is
   largely legal today, a strong response will involve new legislation and
   associated enforcement actions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel simulator of energy consumption patterns

   isolated microgrid (Huatacondo, Chile) that has a particular DSM
   strategy without economic incentives. The simulator uses Markov chains
   to generate data characterizing consumption patterns without DSM and
   Bayesian networks for cases in which the users respond to the DSM
   strategy. Data obtained from the simulator are used to derive a response
   model of the consumers to the DSM interface, which can be included for
   the energy management system design. Results show that the implemented

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE Despite the significant contribution of surgical spending to
   health care costs, most surgeons are unaware of their operating room
   costs. OBJECTIVE To examine the association between providing surgeons
   with individualized cost feedback and surgical supply costs in the
   operating room.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The OR Surgical Cost Reduction (OR
   SCORE) project was a single-health system, multihospital,
   multidepartmental prospective controlled study in an urban academic
   setting. Intervention participants were attending surgeons in orthopedic
   surgery, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, and neurological surgery
   (n = 63). Control participants were attending surgeons in cardiothoracic
   surgery, general surgery, vascular surgery, pediatric surgery,
   obstetrics/ gynecology, ophthalmology, and urology (n = 186).
   INTERVENTIONS From January 1 to December 31, 2015, each surgeon in the
   intervention group received standardized monthly scorecards showing the
   median surgical supply direct cost for each procedure type performed in
   the prior month compared with the surgeon's baseline (July 1, 2012, to
   November 30, 2014) and compared with all surgeons at the institution
   performing the same procedure at baseline. All surgical departments were
   eligible for a financial incentive if theymet a 5\% cost reduction goal.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomewas each group's median
   surgical supply cost per case. Secondary outcome measures included total
   departmental surgical supply costs, case mix index-adjusted median
   surgical supply costs, patient outcomes (30-day readmission, 30-day
   mortality, and discharge status), and surgeon responses to a
   postintervention study-specific health care value survey.
   RESULTS The median surgical supply direct costs per case decreased
   6.54\% in the intervention group, from \$1398 (interquartile range
   {[}IQR], \$ 316-\$5181) (10 637 cases) in 2014 to \$1307 (IQR,
   \$319-\$5037) (11 820 cases) in 2015. In contrast, the median surgical
   supply direct cost increased 7.42\% in the control group, from \$712
   (IQR, \$202-\$1602) (16 441 cases) in 2014 to \$765 (IQR, \$233-\$1719)
   (17 227 cases) in 2015. This decrease represents a total savings of
   \$836 147 in the intervention group during the 1-year study. After
   controlling for surgeon, department, patient demographics, and clinical
   indicators in a mixed-effects model, there was a 9.95\%(95\% CI,
   3.55\%-15.93\%; P =.003) surgical supply cost decrease in the
   intervention group over 1 year. Patient outcomes were equivalent or
   improved after the intervention, and surgeons who received scorecards
   reported higher levels of cost awareness on the health care value survey
   compared with controls.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Cost feedback to surgeons, combined with a
   small departmental financial incentive, was associated with
   significantly reduced surgical supply costs, without negatively
   affecting patient outcomes.}},

Title = {{Readiness for Delivering Digital Health at Scale: Lessons From a
   Longitudinal Qualitative Evaluation of a National Digital Health
   Innovation Program in the United Kingdom}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{Background: Digital health has the potential to support care delivery
   for chronic illness. Despite positive evidence from localized
   implementations, new technologies have proven slow to become accepted,
   integrated, and routinized at scale.
   Objective: The aim of our study was to examine barriers and facilitators
   to implementation of digital health at scale through the evaluation of a
   37m pound national digital health program: Delivering Assisted Living
   Lifestyles at Scale{''} (dallas) from 2012-2015.
   Methods: The study was a longitudinal qualitative, multi-stakeholder,
   implementation study. The methods included interviews (n=125) with key
   implementers, focus groups with consumers and patients (n=7), project
   meetings (n=12), field work or observation in the communities (n=16),
   health professional survey responses (n=48), and cross program
   documentary evidence on implementation (n=215). We used a sociological
   theory called normalization process theory (NPT) and a longitudinal (3
   years) qualitative framework analysis approach. This work did not study
   a single intervention or population. Instead, we evaluated the processes
   (of designing and delivering digital health), and our outcomes were the
   identified barriers and facilitators to delivering and mainstreaming
   services and products within the mixed sector digital health ecosystem.
   Results: We identified three main levels of issues influencing readiness
   for digital health: macro (market, infrastructure, policy), meso
   (organizational), and micro (professional or public). Factors hindering
   implementation included: lack of information technology (IT)
   infrastructure, uncertainty around information governance, lack of
   incentives to prioritize interoperability, lack of precedence on
   accountability within the commercial sector, and a market perceived as
   difficult to navigate. Factors enabling implementation were: clinical
   endorsement, champions who promoted digital health, and public and
   professional willingness.
   Conclusions: Although there is receptiveness to digital health, barriers
   to mainstreaming remain. Our findings suggest greater investment in
   national and local infrastructure, implementation of guidelines for the
   safe and transparent use and assessment of digital health,
   incentivization of interoperability, and investment in upskilling of
   professionals and the public would help support the normalization of
   digital health. These findings will enable researchers, health care
   practitioners, and policy makers to understand the current landscape and
   the actions required in order to prepare the market and accelerate
   uptake, and use of digital health and wellness services in context and
   at scale.}},

Title = {{Price elasticity of the demand for soft drinks, other sugar-sweetened
   beverages and energy dense food in Chile}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{FEB 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Chile is the second world's largest per capita consumer of
   caloric beverages. Caloric beverages are associated with overweight,
   obesity and other chronic diseases. The objective of this study is to
   estimate the price elasticity of demand for soft drinks, other
   sugar-sweetened beverages and high-energy dense foods in urban areas in
   Chile in order to evaluate the potential response of households'
   consumption to changes in prices.
   Methods: We used microdata from the VII Family Budget Survey 2012-2013,
   which collects information on expenditures made by Chilean urban
   households on items such as beverages and foods. We estimated a Linear
   Approximation of an Almost Ideal Demand System Model to derive own and
   cross price elasticities of milk, coffee, tea and other infusions, plain
   water, soft drinks, other flavored beverages, sweet snacks, sugar and
   honey, and desserts. We considered the censored nature of the data and
   included the Inverse Mills Ratio in each equation of the demand system.
   We estimated a Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System and a two-part model
   as sensitivity analysis.
   Results: We found an own price-elasticity of -1.37 for soft drinks. This
   implies that a price increase of 10\% is associated with a reduction in
   consumption of 13.7\%. We found that the rest of food and beverages
   included in the demand system behave as substitutes for soft drinks. For
   instance, plain water showed a cross-price elasticity of 0.63: a 10\%
   increase in price of soft drinks could lead to an increase of 6.3\% of
   plain water. Own and cross price elasticities were similar between
   models.
   Conclusions: The demand of soft drinks is price sensitive among Chilean
   households. An incentive system such as subsidies to non-sweetened
   beverages and tax to soft drinks could lead to increases in the
   substitutions for other healthier beverages.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   To establish a baseline overall response rate for surveys of health
   professions trainees, determine strategies associated with improved
   response rates, and evaluate for the presence of nonresponse bias.
   Method
   The authors performed a comprehensive analysis of all articles published
   in Academic Medicine, Medical Education, and Advances in Health Sciences
   Education in 2013, recording response rates. Additionally, they reviewed
   nonresponse bias analyses and factors suggested in other fields to
   affect response rate including survey delivery method, prenotification,
   and incentives.
   Results
   The search yielded 732 total articles; of these, 356 were research
   articles, and of these, 185 (52.0\%) used at least one survey. Of these,
   66 articles (35.6\%) met inclusion criteria and yielded 73 unique
   surveys. Of the 73 surveys used, investigators reported a response rate
   for 63.0\% of them; response rates ranged from 26.6\% to 100\%, mean
   (standard deviation) 71.3\% (19.5\%). Investigators reported using
   incentives for only 16.4\% of the 73 surveys. The only survey
   methodology factor significantly associated with response rate was
   single-vs. multi-institutional surveys (respectively, 74.6\% {[}21.2\%]
   vs. 62.0\% {[}12.8\%], P = .022). Notably, statistical power for all
   analyses was limited. No articles evaluated for nonresponse bias.
   Conclusions
   Approximately half of the articles evaluated used a survey as part of
   their methods. Limited data are available to establish a baseline
   response rate among health professions trainees and inform researchers
   which strategies are associated with higher response rates. Journals
   publishing survey-based health professions education research should
   improve reporting of response rate, nonresponse bias, and other survey
   factors.}},

Title = {{Perceived Barriers to Implementing Individual Choosing Wisely(A (R))
   Recommendations in Two National Surveys of Primary Care Providers}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{While some research has examined general attitudes about efforts to
   reduce overutilization of services, such as the Choosing Wisely(A (R))
   (CW) initiative, little data exists regarding primary care providers'
   attitudes regarding individual recommendations.
   We sought to identify whether particular CW recommendations were
   perceived by primary care providers as difficult to follow, difficult
   for patients to accept, or both.
   Two national surveys, one by mail to a random sample of 2000 U.S.
   primary care physicians in November 2013, and the second electronically
   to a random sample of 2500 VA primary care providers (PCPs) in
   October-December 2014.
   A total of 603 U.S. primary care physicians and 1173 VA primary care
   providers. Response rates were 34 and 48 \%, respectively.
   PCP ratings of whether 12 CW recommendations for screening, testing and
   treatments applicable to adult primary care were difficult to follow and
   difficult for patients to accept; and ratings of potential barriers to
   reducing overutilization.
   For four recommendations regarding not screening or testing in
   asymptomatic patients, less than 20 \% of PCPs found the CW
   recommendations difficult to accept (range 7.2-16.6 \%) or difficult for
   patients to follow (12.2-19.3 \%). For five recommendations regarding
   testing or treatment for symptomatic conditions, however, there was both
   variation in reported difficulty to follow (9.8-32 \%) and a high level
   of reported difficulty for patients to accept (35.7-87.1 \%). The most
   frequently reported barriers to reducing overuse included malpractice
   concern, patient requests for services, lack of time for shared decision
   making, and the number of tests recommended by specialists.
   While PCPs found many CW recommendations easy to follow, they felt that
   some, especially those for symptomatic conditions, would be difficult
   for patients to accept. Overcoming PCPs' perceptions of patient
   acceptability will require approaches beyond routine physician
   education, feedback and financial incentives.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is
   the largest federal food assistance program designed to alleviate food
   insecurity and improve dietary intake. This study assessed the opinions
   of SNAP participants and food-insufficient nonparticipants on their
   perceptions of the program and strategies to improve its nutritional
   impact.
   Methods: This study surveyed 387 individuals via Amazon Mechanical Turk,
   of whom 118 were SNAP participants and 269 were food insufficient but
   not enrolled in SNAP (nonparticipants). Open-ended questions were coded
   and analyzed for thematic content. For closed-ended questions, response
   frequencies were compared using chi-square tests. Data were analyzed in
   2016.
   Results: SNAP participants reported that the program successfully served
   its primary purpose: to allow individuals to buy enough food to make
   ends meet and reduce food insecurity. Importance was placed on buying
   food for their children/families and the ability to allocate money for
   other expenses. To improve the nutritional impact, SNAP participants
   suggested more nutrition education, increasing the benefit allotment,
   incentivizing healthful foods, and excluding unhealthful foods for
   purchase with SNAP. When participants and nonparticipants were asked to
   choose between SNAP and a nutritionally enhanced program combining
   healthy incentives with exclusions for sugary beverages (i.e., SNAP+),
   68\% of participants and 83\% of nonparticipants chose SNAP+. Of those
   who initially chose SNAP, 68\% of participants and 64\% of
   nonparticipants chose SNAP+ if paired with a 50\% increase in total
   benefits.
   Conclusions: SNAP participants and food-insufficient nonparticipants

   purchases of unhealthful foods, specifically sugary beverages. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{To assess both the behaviors and social variables related to
   antimicrobial therapy for clinical mastitis, we sent a survey to 1,700
   dairy farms in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Florida in January and
   February 2013. The survey included questions related to 7 major areas:
   sociodernographic and farm characteristics, milking proficiency, milking
   systems, cow environment, infected cow monitoring and treatment, farm
   labor, and attitudes toward mastitis and related antimicrobial use. The
   overall response rate was 41\% (21\% in Florida, 39\% in Michigan, and
   45\% in Pennsylvania). Herd size ranged from 9 to 5,800 cows. Only a
   small proportion of herds frequently or always cultured milk samples for
   bacteriology from cows with a high somatic cell count (17\%), cows with
   clinical mastitis (18\%), or bulk tank milk (13\%). Likewise, only 56\%
   of herds frequently or always maintained records of all treated cows and
   49\% reviewed records before administering mastitis treatments.
   Multivariate analysis determined that use of treatment records was
   associated with increased likelihood of frequent use for both
   intramammary (IMA) and systemic (SYA) administration of antimicrobial
   drugs for therapy of clinical mastitis. As would be expected, use of
   natural (organic) therapies was associated with decreased use of IMA, as
   was the respondent being a member of an Amish community. Lower levels of
   education and the use of bacterins to control Staphylococcus aureus
   mastitis were also associated with decreased IMA, whereas increased use
   of IMA at dry off and the belief that ``bad luck{''} plays a role in
   mastitis problems were associated with increased IMA. Use of an internal
   teat sealant, the respondent being the sole proprietor, being from
   Michigan, use of conductivity to measure subclinical mastitis, the
   respondent placing increasing importance on decreasing antibiotic
   residues in cull Cows, and having financial incentives for employees
   linked to somatic cell count were associated with increased use of SYA
   for the treatment of clinical mastitis. Use of sand or mattresses for
   bedding were associated with decreased SYA. These findings highlight the
   need to improve the acceptance of practices that are consistent with
   prudent antimicrobial use for the treatment of clinical mastitis on
   dairy farms. Additionally, the willingness of dairy farmers to
   administer antimicrobial drugs for the treatment of clinical mastitis is
   associated with other mastitis-related practices and attitudes.}},

Title = {{Recreational fishing in a time of rapid ocean change}},
Journal = {{MARINE POLICY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{76}},
Pages = {{169-177}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Fishing is an important recreational activity for many Australians, with
   one in every four people participating every year. There are however
   many different pressures exerted on Australian fish stocks, including
   climate related changes that drive changes in local fish abundances. It
   is inevitable that recreational fishers will need to adapt to these
   changes. When resource abundance alters substantially, user adaptation
   to the new situation is required and policies and incentives may need to
   be developed to encourage behaviour change. It is important to correctly
   anticipate fisher's response to these policies and incentives as much as
   possible. Improved understanding of recreational fisher's likely
   adaptation decisions and the nature and timing of these decisions can
   help avoid unintended consequences of management decisions. Based on a
   survey of recreational fishers in the south-east Australian climate
   hotspot, we identify 4 relevant dimensions to recreational fisher's
   behavioural adaptation. There are differences in adaptation timing
   (early, late, and non-adaptors). Non-adaptors are characterised by
   greater cultural attachment to fishing and stronger perceptions of the
   factors that influence abundance change. The fisher's preferred
   adaptation responses and the timing of the behavioural response differs
   between decreasing versus increasing fish abundance. Insight into
   perspectives and expectations on how recreational fishers might adapt to
   changes is useful to develop a set of behavioural incentives that appeal
   to different groups but remain efficient and effective in their
   implementation. Such knowledge can create new pathways to achieve
   meaningful and targeted adaptation responses for different types of
   recreational fishers.}},

Abstract = {{Use of zinc (Zn) fertilisers may be cost-effective in increasing crop
   yields and in alleviating dietary Zn deficiency. However, Zn fertilisers
   are underutilised in many countries despite the widespread occurrence of
   Zn-deficient soils. Here, increased Zn fertiliser-use scenarios were
   simulated for wheat production in Punjab and Sindh Provinces, Pakistan.
   Inputs and outputs were valued in terms of both potential yield gains as
   well as health gains in the population.
   The current dietary Zn deficiency risk of 23.9 \% in Pakistan was based
   on food supply and wheat grain surveys. ``Disability-adjusted life years
   (DALYs) lost{''} are a common metric of disease burden; an estimated
   245,000 DALYs y(-1) are lost in Punjab and Sindh due to Zn deficiency.
   Baseline Zn fertiliser-use of 7.3 kt y(-1) ZnSO4.H2O was obtained from
   published and industry sources. The wheat area currently receiving Zn
   fertilisers, and grain yield responses of 8 and 14 \% in Punjab and
   Sindh, respectively, were based on a recent survey of > 2500 farmers.
   Increased grain Zn concentrations under Zn fertilisation were estimated
   from literature data and converted to improved Zn intake in humans and
   ultimately a reduction in DALYs lost.
   Application of Zn fertilisers to the area currently under wheat
   production in Punjab and Sindh, at current soil: foliar usage ratios,
   could increase dietary Zn supply from similar to 12.6 to 14.6 mg capita
   (-1) d(-1), and almost halve the prevalence of Zn deficiency, assuming
   no other changes to food consumption. Gross wheat yield could increase
   by 2.0 and 0.6 Mt. grain y(-1) in Punjab and Sindh, respectively,
   representing an additional return of US\$ > 800 M and an annual
   increased grain supply of 19 kg capita (-1).
   There are potential market- and subsidy-based incentives to increase Zn
   fertiliser-use in Pakistan. Benefit-Cost Ratios (BCRs) for yield alone
   are 13.3 and 17.5 for Punjab and Sindh, respectively. If each DALY is
   monetised at one to three fold Gross National Income per capita on
   purchasing power parity (GNI(PPP)), full adoption of Zn fertiliser for
   wheat provides an additional annual return of 405-1216 M International
   Dollars (I\$) in Punjab alone, at a cost per DALY saved of I\$ 461-619.}},

Title = {{Rural Household Preferences for Active Participation in ``Payment for
   Ecosystem Service{''} Programs: A Case in the Miyun Reservoir Catchment,
   China}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Many payment for ecosystem services (PES) programs, such as the Slope
   Land Conversion Program (SLCP), are passive and require full
   participation by impacted households. In contrast, this study considers
   the alternative of ``active and incomplete{''} participation in PES
   programs, in which participants are not obliged to contract their own
   land, and have the right to select into the program or not. This type of
   program has been popular over the last decade in China; however, there
   have been few studies on the characteristics of willingness to
   participate and implementation. As such, this paper uses the Choice
   Experiment (CE) method to explore ways for inducing effective program
   participation, by analyzing the effects of different regime attributes.
   The case study used to analyze participation utility was the Jing-Ji
   Afforestation Program for Ecological and Water Protection (JAPEWP), a
   typical active-participation forestry PES program, and a key source of
   water near Beijing in the Miyun Reservoir Catchment (MRC). Analyzing
   rural household survey data indicated that the program faces a variety
   of challenges, including long-term maintenance, implementation
   performance, costeffectiveness, and monitoring approaches. There are
   also challenges with one-size-fits-all payment strategies, due to
   ineffective program participation or imperfect implementation regimes.
   In response, this study proposes several policies, including providing
   secure and complete land tenure to the participants, creating more local
   off-farm employment opportunities, designing performance-based
   monitoring systems that are integrated with financial incentives,
   applying differentiated payment strategies, providing capacity building
   to support forestation activities, and establishing a comprehensive
   implementation regime that would address these challenges. These policy
   conclusions provide valuable lessons for other active-participation PES
   programs as well.}},

Journal = {{ONLINE INFORMATION REVIEW}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{691-709}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Based upon social cognition and social exchange theories, the
   purpose of this paper is to develop and test a conceptual model,
   suggesting that customer psychological capitals (CPCs) affect their
   knowledge sharing behavior (KSB) within a virtual innovation community
   (VIC) under the influence of material reward (MR) and reciprocal
   relationship (RR).
   Design/methodology/approach - The sample comprises of valid responses
   collected from 516 customers in five virtual innovation communities via
   an online survey. The authors adopted the hierarchical regression method
   to mitigate any concerns relating to endogeneity within the models, and
   also to test the relationships among the variables.
   Findings - CPC, MR and RR are found to have a profound impact on their
   enthusiasm to share knowledge. Environmental factors play an important
   role in shaping the effects of CPC on KSB. MR tends to weaken the
   positive effect of CPC on KSB, whilst RR tends to strengthen the
   positive effect.
   Practical implications - To effectively manage a VIC, firms should make
   full use of the positive impact of CPC on KSB, set up appropriate
   incentive mechanisms and create a virtuous community atmosphere to
   encourage knowledge sharing.
   Originality/value - This study integrates two theoretical perspectives
   to examine which types of psychological and environmental factors, and
   which combinations of these factors, affect innovative customers to
   share knowledge. It offers useful guidelines for firms to engage in
   effective customer-driven products, services and/or processes

Title = {{Corporate social responsibility disclosure Perspectives from sell-side
   and buy-side financial analysts}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING MANAGEMENT AND POLICY JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{2-19}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine the usage of
   non-financial information related to corporate social responsibility
   (CSR) issues from the perspective of sell-side analysts (SSAs) and
   buy-side analysts (BSAs) employed in Poland-based financial
   institutions.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors conducted a survey among
   financial analysts with the use of the computer-assisted telephone
   interview ( CATI) method and an online questionnaire. The adopted
   methods included purposeful, quota sampling and snowball sampling.
   Findings - Results indicate that financial analysts make use of CSR
   disclosures very rarely and attribute little importance to such
   information. Despite the limited use of CSR information and negative
   assessments of its quality, respondents are in favor of making a more
   frequent use of CSR disclosures. Finally, except for an analyst's
   attitude toward the ``comparability in time{''} information
   characteristic, results do not indicate any significant differences
   between SSAs' and BSAs' responses.
   Research limitations/implications - The limited number of questionnaires
   prevented the use of more sophisticated statistical methods and the
   formulation of conclusions that could apply to the entire population. In
   addition, although the adopted CATI method provides a number of
   advantages, it also has its limitations interviews had limited time and
   the questions along with the answers had to take into account the
   respondents' limited perception ability.
   Practical implications - The results of this study suggest that CSR
   disclosures have limited usage for financial analysts, at least in the
   Polish context. Further, not only do respondents rarely make use of CSR
   disclosures but they also give low assessments to their quality. This
   implies that the concept of CSR remains relatively far from becoming a
   priority; hence, some measures and incentives may be necessary.
   Originality/value - The paper adds to a relatively small number of
   studies that have dealt with the issue of non-financial information and
   its usefulness for SSAs and BSAs in Central and Eastern Europe.}},

   Record: A Follow-Up Study}},
Journal = {{APPLIED CLINICAL INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1044-1053}},
Abstract = {{Background There is continuing interest in how physicians are responding
   to the meaningful use of the electronic health record (EHR) incentive
   program. However, little research has been done on physician beliefs
   about the meaningful use of the EHR.
   Objective This study aims to conduct a follow-up study of physician
   beliefs about the meaningful use of the EHR.
   Methods Online survey of physicians at two academic medical centers
   (AMCs) in the northeast who were participating in the meaningful use of
   the EHR incentive program and were using an internally developed EHR was
   conducted.
   Results Of the 2,033 physicians surveyed, 1,075 completed the survey for
   an overall response rate of 52.9\%. Only one-fifth (20.5\%) of the
   physicians agreed or strongly agreed that meaningful use of the EHR
   would help them improve quality of care, and only a quarter (25.2\%)
   agreed or strongly agreed that the meaningful use of the EHR would
   improve the care that their organization delivers. Physician
   satisfaction with the outpatient EHR was the strongest predictor of
   self-efficacy with achieving stage 2 of the meaningful use of the EHR
   incentive program (odds ratio: 2.10, 95\% confidence interval: 1.61,
   2.75, p < 0.001). Physicians reported more negative beliefs in stage 2
   than stage 1 across all belief items. For example, 28.1\% agreed or
   strongly agreed that the meaningful use of the EHR would decrease
   medical errors in stage 2 as compared with 35.9\% in stage 1 (p <
   0.001).
   Conclusion Only one-fifth of the physicians in our study believed that
   the meaningful use of the EHR would improve quality of care,
   patient-centeredness of care, or the care they personally provide.
   Primary care physicians expressedmore negative beliefs about the
   meaningful use of the EHR in stage 2 than in stage 1. These findings
   show that physicians continue to express negative beliefs about the
   meaningful use of the EHR. These ongoing negative beliefs are concerning
   for both implementation and policy.}},

Pages = {{165-176}},
Abstract = {{Effective climate change mitigation and adaptation in agriculture
   requires farmers to gain sufficient information to plan and implement
   practical climate-related actions. Science-based knowledge that meets
   actors' needs supports proactive action taking. The aim of this study
   was to characterize the views of farmers and other rural stakeholders
   regarding farmers' climate change information needs, and to identify
   potential barriers to and necessary incentives for applying climate
   change mitigation and adaptation in practice. Data were collected by
   conducting an internet survey in Finland for which 340 responses from
   farmers, farm advisers and other rural stakeholders were received.
   Applying cluster analysis, 5 information need profiles were identified:
   `information highlighters', `globally and nationally oriented',
   `livestock oriented', `plant production oriented' and `no interest'.
   Half of the respondents believed that climate change would affect their
   activities in the near future. Among respondent groups, farmers
   themselves perceived the information on climate change as most
   uninteresting. The complexity of the current climate change
   communication and potential economic costs associated with proactivity
   were found to hinder both mitigation and proactive adaptation actions.
   Based on our study, climate change communication needs to be
   practice-oriented and tailored to fit the needs of farmers representing
   different lines of agricultural production and regional locations. Such
   information, plus an integration of an assessment of the effects of
   proactive action taking on farm profitability, is needed to encourage
   climate change mitigation and adaptation actions on Finnish farms.}},

   small-scale fishery}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the cross-scale nature of how natural resource trading
   links to local extraction patterns remains a topic of great relevance to
   stewardship and sustainable use of ecological systems. Microeconomic
   influences on a society's pattern of small-scale natural resources
   utilization can exacerbate resource overuse, especially under increased
   population pressure. In many rural communities that are based on a
   limited diversity of resource industries, quantifying the response of
   extractors and traders to market and environmental fluctuations is
   critical to understanding management constraints. We examine the fishing
   practices of a small lake in Uganda, East Africa, from the dual
   perspectives of the traders and the fishers using a Bayesian Belief
   Network approach based on detailed interview surveys. Fishers in this
   small lake target Nile perch (Lates niloticus) and Nile tilapia
   (Oreochromis niloticus), two fish species of high commercial and food
   security significance in East Africa. We combined data on financial,
   social, and ecological systems to understand how aspects of trading
   quantitatively relate to fish extraction patterns in Lake Nabugabo
   Uganda. Importantly, we find that the patron-client type relationships
   generate incentives to extract specific fish, whereas ``freelancer{''}
   independent fishers are able to create responsive and flexible
   extraction practices that match market and environmental fluctuations.
   Management of fishing administered by local Beach Management Units will
   likely have a higher probability of success when in synchrony with
   trading relationships and ecological dynamics. We use this study in
   Uganda to reflect on methodological challenges and opportunities of
   combining multiple types of data sets for cross-scale analysis of
   social-ecological system dynamics.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Objective: In this paper we present lessons learned from an online study
   assessing couples' health behaviors. Methods: We conducted an online
   cross-sectional study to assess health behaviors of dual-smoker couples.
   Participants were recruited via passive and targeted methods. Data were
   collected from 77 (pre-safeguard) and 197 (post-safeguard) participants.
   Safeguards included: (1) changing the incentive from prepaid card to
   raffle; (2) allowing only one IP address per response; (3) masking
   eligibility; (4) adding multiple questions to ensure consistency in
   responses; and (5) emphasizing data surveillance. We computed
   descriptive statistics using SAS 9.4 to compare enrollment rates and
   validity of data between the pre-and post-safeguard participants.
   Results: Although 77 entries were collected within 24 hours
   (pre-safeguards), 5 responses were ineligible and excluded. Among the
   remaining 72 entries, 68.1\% were fraudulent as either multiple data
   entries (24.5\%) and/or conflict in responses to similar survey items

Abstract = {{Under what conditions are foreign aid donors willing to suspend foreign
   aid to punish political transgressions, such as election fraud,
   corruption scandals or political repression? Prior scholarship has
   emphasized that political sanctions, including foreign aid suspensions,
   are constrained by the geostrategic considerations of donor countries.
   However, foreign aid suspensions often occur in strategically important
   countries, and donors respond differently to different types of
   political transgressions within the same county. To shed light on this
   puzzle, in this article, I present evidence from an original survey of
   top-level donor representatives in 20 African countries, including a
   list experiment designed to elicit truthful responses about the
   conditions under which donors are willing to suspend foreign aid. I
   argue that the likelihood of a foreign aid suspension depends not only
   on the strategic considerations of the donor government, but also on the
   institutional incentives of the donor agency. A donor agency's
   institutional incentives are shaped by the agency's organizational
   design, as well as by its foreign aid portfolio in the recipient

Journal = {{CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{18-31}},
Abstract = {{A key message of the 2014 US 3rd National Climate Assessment report is
   that climate change poses threats to agriculture and will require
   adaptation and mitigation by farmers. In the upper Midwest, the increase
   in total precipitation and a 37\% increase in very heavy precipitation
   over the past 40 years are expected to continue and affect the
   productivity of corn-based cropping systems. The current situation and
   weather projections suggest that in the future, significant degradation
   of soil and water resources can be expected. While a number of adaptive
   management strategies have potential to address soil erosion, poor water
   quality, and production losses, farmer responses to a changing climate
   are not well understood. The research presented here examines how
   farmers' self-identity as ``a good farmer{''} can translate into
   specific incremental and transformative adaptations of farming
   strategies. Analysis of a 2012 survey of 4778 upper Midwest farmers
   finds that three nodes in the identity control model, the biophysical
   situation, reflected appraisals comprised of a set of beliefs which are
   sources of information input, and a farmer's identities, influence
   variations in selected adaptive management practices. The biophysical
   situation (flooding, drought, saturated soils, and/or having a river run
   through the farm) are significant explanatory variables in seven of the
   eight models and farmer's identities, conservationist and/or
   productivist,are significant in all models. This is evidence that
   farmers are paying attention to the biophysical situation as well as
   being guided by their own understandings of themselves as good farmers
   in making decisions about their farm operation. More research is needed
   to better understand what activates identities, core values and beliefs
   and how some values are privileged over others in adaptive decisions.
   This work suggests that educators and policymakers should focus on
   interventions, incentives and policies that activate the farmer's
   conservationist identity to increase adaptations that protect the
   agroecosystem in the longer term. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This article seeks to address an old and recurring theme in development
   economics-the slow adoption of new technologies by farmers in many
   developing countries. We explore a somewhat novel explanation for this
   puzzle-the link between market access and the incentives to adopt a new
   technology when there are non-convexities. We develop a theoretical
   model to guide the empirical analysis that uses spatially disaggregated
   agricultural production data from the International Food Policy Research
   Institute and Living Standards Measurement Study survey data for
   Nigeria. We estimate the impact of transport costs on crop production,
   adoption of modern technologies, and the differential impact on returns
   of modern versus traditional farmers. To overcome the limitation of data
   availability on travel costs for much of Africa, we combine road survey
   data and GIS roads networks to generate the most thorough and accurate
   road network available, to our knowledge. Using these data and the
   Highway Development Management Model (HDM-4), we compute minimum travel
   costs from each location to the market. Consistent with our theory we
   find that transportation costs are critical in determining technology
   choices, with a greater responsiveness among farmers who adopt modern
   technologies, and at times a perverse (negative) response to lower
   transport costs among those who employ more traditional techniques. In
   sum, we present compelling evidence that the constraints to the adoption
   of modern technologies and access to markets are interconnected, and so
   should be targeted jointly.}},

   ascertains the environmental attitudes and opinions of the residents and
   investigates their behavioral responses to waste management initiatives.
   Practical implications for enhancing sustainable waste management are
   discussed in this paper.
   Design/methodology/approach - Demonstration projects on waste
   segregation and recycling, as well as waste a reduction campaign, were
   set up on the campus to ascertain people's attitudes and investigate
   their behavioral responses toward 3R practices. Data were collected
   through a questionnaire survey, observations, interviews and the
   project's document review. A waste audit and waste composition analysis
   was carried out to assess waste flows and actual waste management
   behaviors and measure the change in the recycling rate.
   Findings - 3R waste management initiatives had positive effects on
   people's attitudes about resources, waste management and consciousness
   of the need to avoid waste, but these initiatives did not affect
   recycling and waste management behavior. A voluntary approach-only
   cannot bring about behavioral change. Incentive measures showed a
   greater positive effect on waste reduction to landfills. Nevertheless,
   the demonstration projects helped to increase the overall campus
   recycling from 10 to 12 per cent.
   Originality/value - This paper addresses a literature gap about the 3R
   attitudes and resulting behavior as part of campus sustainability of
   higher education institutions in a developing country. The authors'
   results revealed hurdles to be overcome and presents results that can be
   compared to behavioral responses of people from other developed
   countries. These findings can be used as a guide for higher education
   institution's policy-makers, as they indicate that voluntary instruments
   alone will not yield effective results, and other mechanisms that have
   an impact on people's behavior are required.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Despite the benefits of early planning for business succession,
   and plan implementation, many owners/managers fail to act expeditiously.
   Factors such as a reluctance to accept ageing, a concern over the risks
   involved and inappropriate objectives may be causative. This research
   moves towards explaining this reluctance and, consequently, suggesting
   ways to reduce the problem. Design/approach/methodology: Using the
   literature outlining the variables associated with succession, a
   hypothesis using the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) is developed to
   explain the differences between planned and actual asset transfer (using
   a structural equation model of the TPB). Data to explore the problem and
   test the model were obtained from a postal survey of 2300 New Zealand
   farms (36\% response). Findings: The results show manager attitudes
   related to their personality and objectives are the main causes of
   reluctance. The financial benefits from successful succession also need
   determining to provide incentives. Practical applications: Support
   systems are required to modify farmer attitudes and consequently reduce
   the reluctance. Originality/value: This work presents one of the first
   attempts to quantify and systems model (using the TPB) the succession
   process in a rural setting, and provides clear conclusions on reducing
   succession reluctance. Theoretical implications: Farming is controlled
   by humans reinforcing that farm studies must include the personal
   aspects of the decision-makers.}},

   of private investment?}},
Journal = {{FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{40-48}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Cost sharing has been widely used to encourage the management of
   privately owned forests. While there is evidence of its capacity to
   promote management activities, it still remains open whether cost
   sharing induces additional private investments or whether it substitutes
   public funds for private capital. This study re-examines the latter
   issue in the case of Finnish family forest owners' pre-commercial and
   restoration thinnings using data from a nation-wide survey (n = 3801). A
   two-step model of cost-share participation and stand improvements is
   used to account for the endogeneity of cost-share participation.
   Cost-share participation was related to personal assistance and clearly
   encouraged forest owners' engagement in and extent of stand
   improvements. The inducement or crowding out of private capital is
   analytically shown to depend on the relative magnitude of forest owners'
   response to cost-share incentives in each specific situation. In the
   present case evidence suggests that cost sharing has had an inducement
   effect on private investment. This is likely related to the advanced
   personal assistance that has promoted the knowledge of and participation
   in cost sharing. The findings suggest that cost sharing can be a useful
   component in a balanced policy mix especially when combined with
   informational instruments. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A new team learning assessment process was designed and tested in a

   process involves randomly dividing students into teams of four to work
   on a physics experiment and, at the end of the laboratory session,
   randomly selecting only one team member to carry out a post-laboratory
   session performance task. The results indicate that learning outcomes
   were not compromised in the new assessment process and that peer
   instruction was employed to a greater extent compared to our standard
   process. Student responses from a post-assessment survey revealed that
   76\% of students considered our new assessment process to be fair,

Abstract = {{Objective. Performance thresholds are commonly used in
   pay-for-performance (P4P) incentives, where providers receive a bonus
   payment for achieving a prespecified target threshold but may produce
   discontinuous incentives, with providers just below the threshold having
   the strongest incentive to improve and providers either far below or
   above the threshold having little incentive. We investigate the effect
   of performance thresholds on provider response in the setting of nursing
   home P4P.
   Data Sources. The Minimum Data Set (MDS) and Online Survey,
   Certification, and Reporting (OSCAR) datasets.
   Study Setting and Design. Difference-in-differences design to test for
   changes in nursing home performance in three states that implemented
   threshold-based P4P (Colorado, Georgia, and Oklahoma) versus three
   comparator states (Arizona, Tennessee, and Arkansas) between 2006 and
   2009.
   Principal Findings. We find that those farthest below the threshold
   (i.e., the worst-performing nursing homes) had the largest improvements
   under threshold-based P4P while those farthest above the threshold
   worsened. This effect did not vary with the percentage of Medicaid
   residents in a nursing home.
   Conclusions. Threshold-based P4P may provide perverse incentives for
   nursing homes above the performance threshold, but we do not find
   evidence to support concerns about the effects of performance thresholds
   on low-performing nursing homes.}},

Abstract = {{Successful deployment of smart grids necessitates experimental
   validation of their state-of-the-art designs in two-way communications,
   real-time demand response, and monitoring of consumers' energy usage
   behavior. The objective is to observe consumers' energy usage pattern
   and exploit this information to assist the grid in designing incentives,
   energy management mechanisms, and real-time demand response protocols,
   so as help the grid achieve lower costs and improve energy supply
   stability. Further, by feeding the observed information back to the
   consumers instantaneously, it is also possible to promote energy
   efficient behavior among users. To this end, this paper performs a
   literature survey on smart grid testbeds around the world, and presents
   the main accomplishments toward realizing a smart grid testbed at the
   Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). The testbed is
   able to monitor, analyze, and evaluate smart grid communication network
   design and control mechanisms, and test the suitability of various
   communications networks for both residential and commercial buildings.
   The testbeds are deployed within the SUTD student dormitories and the
   main university campus to monitor and record end-user energy consumption
   in real-time, which will enable us to design incentives, control
   algorithms, and real-time demand response schemes. The testbed also
   provides an effective channel to evaluate the needs of communication
   networks to support various smart grid applications. In addition, our
   initial results demonstrate that our testbed can provide an effective
   platform to identify energy waste, and prompt the needs of a secure
   communications channel as the energy usage pattern can provide privacy
   related information on individual users.}},

Abstract = {{Modern society is driven by data. Data storage is practically unlimited
   with today's technology, and analytical tools make it easy to find
   patterns and make predictions in a way that is very useful for private
   businesses and governments. These uses of digital data can raise
   considerable privacy issues that are of great concern to consumers. In
   this Article, we present and analyze the results of an extensive survey
   that we conducted to explore what people know, what people do, and what
   people want when it comes to privacy online.
   Our survey is the first comprehensive examination of the intersection of
   knowledge and opinions on topics including online privacy, law, and the
   data practices of both the private sector and the government. Our survey
   results indicate that consumers often want more options than the market
   gives them. Over 80\% of our survey participants, for example, indicated
   that on some occasion they have submitted information online when they
   wished that they did not have to do so. One of the possible reasons why
   consumers still participate in these markets is that they do not have
   any meaningful alternatives. The private sector currently has very
   little incentive to provide these alternatives because consumers have
   been responding to unattractive business practices with complacency.
   Responses to our survey also indicate a low level of trust of the
   government as a data collector and data keeper.
   Our results indicate that significant changes are needed to increase
   consumer engagement in the online marketplace and improve trust between
   the government and its citizens. These improvements should begin by
   empowering users and giving them more control over their digital data,
   and we present ambitious proposals to this end. The long-term solution
   that we propose would involve an overhaul of current data privacy laws
   and the creation of a centralized profile repository that would serve a
   purpose similar to credit reporting bureaus. Through this repository,
   consumers could view and challenge most information that private
   businesses and the government hold about them. Dramatic changes are
   necessary in order to ensure that consumers can have empowering and
   engaging experiences in today's world of digital data.}},

Abstract = {{Heatwaves are the most dangerous natural hazard to health in Australia.
   The frequency and intensity of heatwaves will increase due to climate
   change and urban heat island effects in cities, aggravating the negative
   impacts of heatwaves. Two approaches exist to develop population heat
   stress resilience. Firstly, the most vulnerable social groups can be
   identified and public health services can prepare for the increased
   morbidity. Secondly, the population level of adaptation and the heat
   stress resistance of the built environment can be increased. The
   evaluation of these measures and their efficiencies has been fragmented
   across research disciplines. This study explored the relationships
   between the elements of heat stress resilience and their potential
   demographic and housing drivers and barriers.
   The responses of a representative online survey (N = 393) about heat
   stress resilience at home and work from Adelaide, South Australia were
   analysed. The empirical findings demonstrate that heat stress resistant
   buildings increased adaptation capacity and decreased the number of
   health problems. Air-conditioning increased dependence upon it, limited
   passive adaptation and only people living in homes with whole-house
   air-conditioning had less health problems during heatwaves. Tenants and
   respondents with pre-existing health conditions were the most
   vulnerable, particularly as those with health conditions were not aware
   of their vulnerability. The introduction of an Energy Performance
   Certificate is proposed and discussed as an effective incentive to
   increase the heat stress resistance of and the general knowledge about

Abstract = {{Intensive agriculture with high inputs has resulted in rapid development
   of crop production in China, accompanied by negative environmental
   effects such as serious non-point source agricultural pollution.
   Implementation of environmentally-friendly agricultural practices can
   effectively prevent such pollution. However, the acceptance and adoption
   of such practices are related not only to associated risks and potential
   benefits, but also to farmers' attitudes to and knowledge of
   scientifically validated practices. In the presented study we surveyed
   views of a stratified sample of 150 smallholder farmers and 10 extension
   service experts from Xinxiang, a high grain-producing county in Henan
   Province, China. Their opinions were explored in personal interviews
   using a questionnaire with three sections. The first section mainly
   sought informationpn surveyed farmers' demographic characteristics like
   gender, age and education. The second section concemed their awareness
   of the environmental problems and losses of yields associated with
   customary over-fertilization practices, and their main concerns about
   new practices. The third section addressed farmers' attitudes to, and
   the extension service experts' professional evaluations of, five
   selected practices in terms of the importance of seven factors (time
   demands, costs, risks, compatibility, complexity, trialability and
   observability). Acceptance indices were calculated from the responses to
   rank farmers' willingness to accept the five environmentally-friendly
   agricultural practices, and thus identify the most appropriate to
   promote in the study area. The results show that costs, followed by
   risks and observability, are the more important factors affecting
   farmers' decisions to adopt a practice. The results also indicate that
   no or minimum tillage and returning straw to the field are the most
   appropriate practices to promote initially at large scale in Xinxiang.
   The others could be popularized gradually after providing effective
   incentives and training. The finding that cost is the main factor
   influencing Chinese farmer contrasts with reports that EU farmers rank
   risk and observability as most important, possibly due to differences in
   income. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY POLICY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{98}},
Pages = {{108-120}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Whilst tariff-based approaches to load-shifting are common in the
   residential sector, incentive-based approaches are rare. This is so,
   even though providing customers incentives to shape their power
   consumption patterns has substantial potential. This paper presents
   findings from an exploratory UK pilot study that trials financial
   payments and detailed energy feedback to incentivise load-shifting of
   residential electricity consumption.
   An intervention study was implemented measuring actual energy use by
   individual households as well as conducting surveys and interviews.
   From the trials it was found that the approaches resulted in reductions
   in peak time energy use. Evidence from the study found that the
   incentives-based approaches were able to overcome some of the barriers
   to response experienced in Time-of-Use studies, though less good on
   others. Interestingly, the height of the barriers varied by the
   electricity-using practice and the incentivising approach applied. The
   height of the barriers also varied by participant.
   The study concludes by identifying that broad participation in demand
   response is likely to require a suite of incentivising approaches that
   appeal to different people, a key policy finding of interest to
   international agencies, government, public and private sector entities.

Abstract = {{Public policy programs must often impose limits on who may be eligible
   for benefits. Despite research on the impact of exclusion in developed
   countries, there is little evidence on how people react to being
   excluded from benefits in developing societies. Utilizing repeated waves
   of data from an experimental evaluation of Mexico's foundational
   PROGRESA antipoverty program, we examine the impact of exclusion and
   distinguish two separate forms. ``Statistical exclusion{''} occurs where
   determination of benefits is based on randomized assignment to a
   treatment and control group. ``Needs-based exclusion{''} occurs when
   benefits programs are designed to be selective rather than universal,
   basing eligibility on characteristics, like relative poverty, that are
   difficult to measure simply and accurately. Focusing on temporal
   variation in survey non-response as our behavioral outcome, we show that
   needs-based exclusion has much greater negative effects on continued
   participation than statistical exclusion. We also show that these
   effects are concentrated among the wealthy, that is, those furthest from
   the eligibility cut-off line.. These findings reinforce general concerns
   about the validity of evaluation studies when incentives are at work. We
   discuss both the behavioral explanations that might underlie these
   findings as well as some potential approaches to reduce threats to
   evaluation validity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Shortages of health workers in low-income countries are
   exacerbated by the international migration of health workers to more
   affluent countries. This problem is compounded by the active recruitment
   of health workers by destination countries, particularly Australia,
   Canada, UK and USA. The World Health Organization (WHO) adopted a
   voluntary Code of Practice in May 2010 to mitigate tensions between
   health workers' right to migrate and the shortage of health workers in
   source countries. The first empirical impact evaluation of this Code was
   conducted 11-months after its adoption and demonstrated a lack of impact
   on health workforce recruitment policy and practice in the short-term.
   This second empirical impact evaluation was conducted 4-years
   post-adoption using the same methodology to determine whether there have
   been any changes in the perceived utility, applicability, and
   implementation of the Code in the medium-term.
   Methods: Forty-four respondents representing government, civil society
   and the private sector from Australia, Canada, UK and USA completed an
   email-based survey evaluating their awareness of the Code, perceived
   impact, changes to policy or recruitment practices resulting from the
   Code, and the effectiveness of non-binding Codes generally. The same
   survey instrument from the original study was used to facilitate direct
   comparability of responses. Key lessons were identified through thematic
   analysis.
   Results: The main findings between the initial impact evaluation and the
   current one are unchanged. Both sets of key informants reported no
   significant policy or regulatory changes to health worker recruitment in
   their countries as a direct result of the Code due to its lack of
   incentives, institutional mechanisms and interest mobilizers.
   Participants emphasized the existence of previous bilateral and regional
   Codes, the WHO Code's non-binding nature, and the primacy of competing
   domestic healthcare priorities in explaining this perceived lack of
   impact.
   Conclusions: The Code has probably still not produced the tangible
   improvements in health worker flows it aspired to achieve. Several
   actions, including a focus on developing bilateral codes, linking the
   Code to topical global priorities, and reframing the Code's purpose to
   emphasize health system sustainability, are proposed to improve the
   Code's uptake and impact.}},

Title = {{Sliding-scale environmental service payments and non-financial
   incentives: Results of a survey of landowner interest in Costa Rica}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{130}},
Pages = {{252-262}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This study presents the results from a survey of landowner interest in a
   propositional payment modality for Costa Rica's Pagos por Servicios
   Ambientales (PSA) program that is based on a sliding-scale payment
   scheme. This payment scheme would transition from higher monetary
   payments per hectare per year for the first units of land invested, to
   lower payments per hectare per Year for additional units of land
   invested; however, as payments per hectare decrease, monetary payments
   would be supplemented with non-financial rewards. This program structure
   is designed to 1) offer higher per-hectare financial incentives to
   smaller scale landowners, who would otherwise face steep trade-off costs
   by transitioning to conservation-based land-use, and 2) offer greater
   non-financial incentives to larger-scale landowners, who face less sharp
   trade-off costs, and who might be more interested in prestige- and
   status-based non-financial incentives than the currently meager PSA
   payments. I found support for the proposed program modality across all
   classes of landowners. Interest in PSA participation by small- and
   medium-scale landowners showed sensitivity to proposed payments, with
   landowners indicating a strong desire to participate in conservation
   land-use as soon as the proposed financial incentives were sufficient to
   cover their opportunity costs. Large-scale landowners showed little
   sensitivity to payment size, and in general-with mode=10 and median=7
   responses on a 10 point Likert-scale-indicated strong willingness to
   participate in the PSA program under the proposed structure, even if
   financial incentives per hectare were decreased significantly for large
   investments of land, but prestige- and status-based awards were
   introduced. These results are discussed in the context of an emerging
   literature on signaling theory, conspicuous conservation, and the
   interaction of financial incentives and social norms. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Community coalitions are a prominent organizational structure through
   which community-based substance abuse prevention efforts are
   implemented. There is little empirical evidence, however, regarding the
   association between coalition attributes and success in achieving
   community-level reductions in substance abuse behaviors. In this study,
   we assessed the relationship between coalition capacity, based on
   coalition coordinator responses to 16 survey items, and reductions in
   underage drinking prevalence rates. The coalitions were funded through
   the federally sponsored Strategic Prevention Framework State Incentive
   Grant (SPF SIG). We first examined whether coalition capacity increased
   over the life of the projects. Mean capacity scores increased for all 16
   capacity items examined (N = 318 coalitions), the majority of which were
   statistically significant. Analysis of the associations between capacity
   and reductions in underage drinking was limited to coalitions that
   targeted underage drinking and provided usable outcome measures based on
   student survey data for either past 30-day alcohol use (N = 129) or
   binge drinking (N = 100). Bivariate associations between the capacity
   items and prevalence reductions for each outcome were consistently
   positive, although many were not statistically significant. Composite
   measures of correlated items were then created to represent six
   different capacity constructs, and included in multivariate models to
   predict reductions in the targeted outcomes. Constructs that
   significantly predicted reductions in one or both outcome measures
   included internal organization and structure, community connections and
   outreach, and funding from multiple sources. The findings provide
   support for the expectation that high functioning community coalitions
   can be effective agents for producing desirable community-level changes
   in targeted substance abuse behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{Inappropriate waste disposal is a serious issue in many urban
   neighborhoods, exacerbating environmental, rodent, and public health
   problems. Governments all over the world have been developing
   interventions to reduce inappropriate waste disposal. A system dynamics
   model is proposed to quantify the impacts of interventions on
   residential waste related behavior. In contrast to other models of
   municipal solid waste management, the structure of our model is based on
   sociological and economic studies on how incentives and social norms
   interactively affect waste disposal behavior, and its parameterization
   is informed by field work. A case study of low-income urban
   neighborhoods in Baltimore, MD, USA is presented. The simulation results
   show the effects of individual interventions, and also identify positive
   interactions among some potential interventions, especially information
   and incentive-based policies, as well as their limitations. The model
   can help policy analysts identify the most promising intervention
   packages, and then field test those few, rather than having to pilot
   test all combinations. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate large
   uncertainties about behavioral responses to some interventions, showing
   where information from survey research and social experiments would
   improve policy making. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To examine rural and urban pharmacy staff perceptions on

   Methods: A survey was distributed through the local pharmacist

   responses were received from pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and
   pharmacy students.
   Results: Across rural and urban regions alike, among the AMI prevention
   messages provided, participants identified the most important messages
   to be: AMI can be potentially dangerous and life threatening; emergency
   rooms should be used when experiencing an AMI; and doctors and
   pharmacists should be consulted about AMI. The most common AMI

Abstract = {{The validity of survey research has been challenged by an alarming
   increase in nonresponse rates over the past four decades. In reaction to
   the public's increasing reluctance to participate in surveys, scholars
   have focused on the reasons for, and consequences of, nonresponse.
   However, children's participation in research is a neglected area of
   study. We address this gap in the literature by examining parental
   consent to allow their children to participate in the Youth Development
   Study (YDS), an ongoing, multigenerational, longitudinal study. Of 411
   parents contacted, 277 (67 percent) provided active consent. By
   estimating a population average model with GEE, we find evidence that
   the context of recruitment-whether the parent is being approached for
   the first time, how the parent responded to prior child recruitment
   efforts, and the provision of a monetary incentive-influences the
   consent decision. The parent's relationship to the child (biological vs.
   stepparent or other), participation in family decision-making, and
   history of participation in YDS surveys are also associated with
   consent. This research contributes to our understanding of parental
   consent and indicates the need for further theoretical and empirical
   work.}},

Abstract = {{Our study examines cross-national variations in intergenerational

   non-coresident children by family structure (intact vs stepfamilies) and
   parent-child relationship type (biological tie vs steprelation). We
   focus on three European countries-France, Germany, and Russia-which have
   in common a relatively large proportion of stepfamilies, but differ with
   regard to contextual characteristics potentially impacting the
   stepfamily-intergenerational-relations nexus.
   The analysis is based on data from the Generations and Gender Survey
   (Wave 1). Our pooled analytical sample consists of 14,309 parent-child
   relationships derived from responses by 6,590 surveyed parents with
   adult children living outside the parental household. We consider two
   core dimensions of intergenerational solidarity as dependent variables,
   namely frequency of contact and emotional closeness.
   Our results support the notion of commonly weaker intergenerational
   relations in stepfamilies. We also observe differences between
   biological parent-child ties and steprelations. Compared with their
   French and German counterparts, there is a weaker association between
   having a steprelation and parent-child contact frequency as well as a
   stronger negative correlation between having a steprelation and
   emotional closeness among Russian respondents.
   The observed cross-national differences are proposed to result from
   different economic incentives to form a stepfamily, translating into a
   stronger ``functional{''} basis of stepfamily intergenerational
   relations in the Russian context.}},

   Objective: To evaluate the impact of a low-cost nonmonetary incentive
   and paper mail reminders (formal letter and postcard) on response rates
   in Internet-based physician surveys.
   Methods: We executed a factorial-design randomized experiment while
   conducting a nationally representative Internet-based physician survey.
   We invited 3966 physicians (randomly selected from a commercial database
   of all licensed US physicians) via email to complete an Internet-based
   survey. We used 2 randomly assigned email messages: one message offered
   a book upon survey completion, whereas the other did not mention the
   book but was otherwise identical. All nonrespondents received several
   email reminders. Some physicians were further assigned at random to
   receive 1 reminder via paper mail (either a postcard or a letter) or no
   paper reminder. The primary outcome of this study was the survey

   Results: Of the 3966 physicians who were invited, 451 (11.4\%) responded
   to at least one survey question and 336 (8.5\%) completed the entire
   survey. Of those who were offered a book, 345/2973 (11.6\%) responded

   The response rate for those receiving letters or postcards was similar
   (odds ratio 1.14, 95\% CI 0.91-1.44, P=.26).
   Conclusions: Offering a modest nonmonetary incentive and sending a paper

Abstract = {{Objectives
   A survey of a population-based sample of U.S adults was conducted to
   measure their attitudes about, and inform the design of the Precision
   Medicine Initiative's planned national cohort study.
   Methods
   An online survey was conducted by GfK between May and June of 2015. The
   influence of different consent models on willingness to share data was
   examined by randomizing participants to one of eight consent scenarios.
   Results
   Of 4,777 people invited to take the survey, 2,706 responded and 2,601
   (54\% response rate) provided valid responses. Most respondents (79\%)
   supported the proposed study, and 54\% said they would definitely or
   probably participate if asked. Support for and willingness to
   participate in the study varied little among demographic groups; younger
   respondents, LGBT respondents, and those with more years of education
   were significantly more likely to take part if asked. The most important
   study incentive that the survey asked about was learning about one's own
   health information. Willingness to share data and samples under broad,
   study-by-study, menu and dynamic consent models was similar when a
   statement about transparency was included in the consent scenarios.
   Respondents were generally interested in taking part in several
   governance functions of the cohort study.
   Conclusions
   A large majority of the U.S. adults who responded to the survey
   supported a large national cohort study. Levels of support for the study
   and willingness to participate were both consistent across most
   demographic groups. The opportunity to learn health information about
   one's self from the study appears to be a strong motivation to
   participate.}},

   Brain Imaging Findings on Human Sexual Behaviors}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{There is an increasing number of neuroimaging studies using visual
   sexual stimuli (VSS), especially within the emerging field of research
   on compulsive sexual behaviors (CSB). A central question in this field
   is whether behaviors such as excessive pornography consumption share
   common brain mechanisms with widely studied substance and behavioral
   addictions. Depending on how VSS are conceptualized, different
   predictions can be formulated within the frameworks of Reinforcement
   Learning or Incentive Salience Theory, where a crucial distinction is
   made between conditioned and unconditioned stimuli (related to reward
   anticipation vs. reward consumption, respectively). Surveying 40 recent
   human neuroimaging studies we show existing ambiguity about the
   conceptualization of VSS. Therefore, we feel that it is important to
   address the question of whether VSS should be considered as conditioned
   stimuli (cue) or unconditioned stimuli (reward). Here we present our own
   perspective, which is that in most laboratory settings VSS play a role
   of reward, as evidenced by: (1) experience of pleasure while watching
   VSS, possibly accompanied by genital reaction; (2) reward-related brain
   activity correlated with these pleasurable feelings in response to VSS;
   (3) a willingness to exert effort to view VSS similarly as for other
   rewarding stimuli such as money; and (4) conditioning for cues
   predictive of VSS. We hope that this perspective article will initiate a

Title = {{The Reasons behind the (Non)Use of Feedback Reports for Quality
   Improvement in Physical Therapy: A Mixed-Method Study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 12}},
Abstract = {{Objectives
   To explain the use of feedback reports for quality improvements by the
   reasons to participate in quality measuring projects and to identify
   barriers and facilitators. Design Mixed methods design.
   Methods
   In 2009-2011 a national audit and feedback system for physical therapy
   (Qualiphy) was initiated in the Netherlands. After each data collection
   round, an evaluation survey was held amongst its participants. The
   evaluation survey data was used to explain the use of feedback reports
   by studying the reasons to participate with Qualiphy with correlation
   measures and logistic regression. Semi-structured interviews with PTs
   served to seek confirmation and disentangle barriers and facilitators.
   Results
   Analysis of 257 surveys (response rate: 42.8\%) showed that therapists
   with only financial reasons were less likely to use feedback reports (OR
   = 0.24; 95\% CI = 0.11-0.52) compared to therapists with a mixture of
   reasons. PTs in 2009 and 2010 were more likely to use the feedback
   reports for quality improvement than PTs in 2011 (OR = 2.41; 95\% CI =
   1.25-4.64 respectively OR = 3.28; 95\% CI = 1.51-7.10). Changing
   circumstances in 2011, i. e. using EHRs and financial incentives, had a
   negative effect on the use of feedback reports (OR = 0.40, 95\% CI =
   0.20-0.78). Interviews with 12 physical therapists showed that feedback
   reports could serve as a tool to support and structure quality
   improvement plans. Barriers were distrust and perceived self-reporting
   bias on indicator scores.
   Conclusions
   Implementing financial incentives that are not well-specified and
   well-targeted can have an adverse effect on using feedback reports to
   improve quality of care. Distrust is a major barrier to implementing
   quality systems.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. To study the effects of several survey features on response
   rates in a general population health survey.
   Methods. In 2012 and 2013, 8000 households in British Columbia, Canada,
   were randomly allocated to 1 of 7 survey variants, each containing a
   different combination of survey features. Features compared included
   administration modes (paper vs online), prepaid incentive (\$2 coin vs
   none), lottery incentive (instant vs end-of-study), questionnaire length
   (10 minutes vs 30 minutes), and sampling frame (InfoCanada vs Canada
   Post).
   Results. The overall response rate across the 7 groups was 27.9\% (range

   associated with statistically significant differences in response rates.
   The survey mode elicited the largest effect on the odds of response

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{786-794}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Sustainable management of hospital waste requires an active involvement
   of all key players. This study aims to test the hypothesis that three
   motivating factors, namely, Reputation, Liability, and Expense,
   influence hospital waste management. The survey for this study was
   conducted in two phases, with the pilot study used for exploratory
   factor analysis and the subsequent main survey used for cross-validation
   using confirmatory factor analysis. The hypotheses were validated
   through one-sample t tests. Correlations were established between the
   three motivating factors and organizational characteristics of hospital
   type, location, category, and size. The hypotheses were validated, and
   it was found that the factors of Liability and Expense varied
   considerably with respect to location and size of a hospital. The factor
   of Reputation, however, did not exhibit significant variation. In
   conclusion, concerns about the reputation of a facility and an
   apprehension of liability act as incentives for sound hospital waste
   management, whereas concerns about financial costs and perceived
   overburden on staff act as disincentives.Implications: This paper
   identifies the non economic motivating factors that can be used to
   encourage behavioral changes regarding waste management at hospitals in
   resource constrained environments. This study discovered that
   organizational characteristics such as hospital size and location cause
   the responses to vary among the subjects. Hence a policy maker must take
   into account the institutional setting before introducing a change
   geared towards better waste management outcomes across hospitals. This
   study covers a topic that has hitherto been neglected in resource
   constrained countries. Thus it can be used as one of the first steps to
   highlight and tackle the issue.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Health reform programs like the patient-centered medical
   home are intended to improve the triple aim. Previous studies on
   patient-centered medical homes have shown mixed effects, but high value
   elements (HVEs) are expected to improve the triple aim.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to understand whether focusing on
   HVEs would improve patient experience with care.
   Methods: Eight clinics were cluster-randomized in a year-long trial.
   Both arms received practice facilitation, IT-based reporting, and
   financial incentives. Intervention practices were encouraged to choose
   HVEs for quality improvement goals. To assess patient experience, 1597
   Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems surveys were
   sent pretrial and posttrial to a stratified random sample of patients.
   Difference-in-difference multivariate analysis was used to compare
   patient responses from intervention and control practices, adjusting for
   confounders.
   Results: The response rate was 43\% (n = 686). Nonrespondent analysis
   showed no difference between arms, although differences were seen by
   risk status and age. The overall difference in difference was 2.8\%,
   favoring the intervention. The intervention performed better in 9 of 11
   composites. The intervention performed significantly better in follow-up

   the intervention, and 8 of 11 for the control.
   Discussion: Practices that targeted HVEs showed significantly more

Title = {{Can Informal Firms Hurt Registered SMEs' Access to Credit?}},
Journal = {{WORLD DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{84}},
Pages = {{18-40}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Using firm-level survey responses from 2009 to 2012, we examine whether
   competitors from the informal sector affect the credit constraints of
   registered SMEs in 86 countries worldwide. We also investigate the role
   played by the quality of institutional environment in exacerbating or in
   alleviating such effect. A weak quality of institutional environment
   strengthens inter-linkages between the formal and the informal sectors,
   increases the costs and decreases the benefits assumed by formal firms,
   and reduces the costs attributed to informality. Moreover, it also
   results in a large informal economy, which influences perceptions about
   the substitutability between formal and informal goods, and law evasion.
   Our findings indicate that registered SMEs facing competition from
   informal firms are more likely to be credit-constrained than other
   formal SMEs that are not confronted with such competition. This result
   is consistent with the ``parasite{''} view and the entrepreneurial
   perspective of informality, which assert that informal firms are capable
   of competing against registered SMEs and hurting the latter's profits.
   Further, we find that such adverse impact manifests only in countries
   with weak rule of law and high degree of corruption and bureaucracy. Our
   results also show that registered micro and small firms are more likely
   to be affected by the presence of informal firm competitors than
   medium-sized firms. This is because the benefits of formality that
   include access to credit from financial institutions, increase with firm
   size. On the whole, our findings suggest that governments must enhance
   their role in increasing access to credit to smaller firms and in
   providing incentives for informal firms to be integrated in the formal
   economy. Moreover, in order to achieve inclusive growth, our results
   highlight the importance of improving the business environment, which
   affects all entrepreneurs. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Adoption of drip irrigation in Kerala State of India is very low and

   was conducted in two districts to determine the major factors

   encourage the adoption. The results indicated that adoption index of
   farmers is higher in Kozhikode, when compared with the Thrissur
   district. However, with respect to different crops, adoption index is
   not statistically significant. Socioeconomic characteristics such as
   age, education, experience, land holding size, etc. have a positive
   influence on drip irrigation adoption index by farmers. Farmers have
   realized yield improvement in the range of about 13\% to 47\% through
   drip irrigation, when compared to surface method of irrigation for
   arecanut, coconut and nutmeg. High productivity and income from
   cultivation of crops like coconut, arecanut and nutmeg have acted as an
   incentive to adopt the costly system of drip irrigation in the case of
   both Kozhikode and Thrissur farmers. The number of drip irrigation
   components and type of emitters indicated a significant and linear
   response for drip irrigation adoption. The reported constraints
   experienced by farmers include rainfall, clogging of drippers, high
   initial cost, inadequate subsidy, difficulty in getting subsidy, etc.
   This information will help to prioritize the factors that affect

Abstract = {{PurposeTo better understand the apparent persistent shortage of

   responses.
   DesignWe examine the employment of RNs over variations in economic
   activity, employing national aggregate and unique micro-population data

   MethodsThese data, including our unique, ongoing survey of nurses in
   Arizona, enable a systematic examination of the cyclical demand for
   hospital care and institutional responses to that demand in the nursing
   market by employing multivariate regressions.
   FindingsDemand for hospital nursing care increases rapidly during the
   early years of recessions, moderating as the economy improves. Hospitals
   initially employ more temporary nurses, then reduce temporary hires by
   shifting employed RNs from part time to full time while also adding RNs
   not previously employed in hospitals. The substitution of regularly
   employed RNs for temporary nurses reflects the need to reduce staffing
   costs to offset increases in uncompensated care.
   ConclusionsThe increased supply of nurses came from delayed retirements,
   higher relative hospital wages (inducing nurses in other sectors to
   return to hospitals), and added-worker effects. Additional nursing hours
   were drawn from a pool of RNs who were not employed in health care.
   Clinical RelevanceThese results strongly suggest that correctly aligned

Journal = {{BRITISH JOURNAL OF GENERAL PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{648}},
Pages = {{E460-E466}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Background
   The ubiquitous use of communication technologies has led to an
   expectation that a similar approach should extend to health care.
   Despite considerable rhetoric about the need for general practices to
   offer alternatives to face-to-face consultations, such as telephone,
   email, and internet video consultations, the extent to which such
   technologies are actually used at present is unclear.
   Aim
   The aim of the survey was to identify the frequency and range of ways in
   which general practices are providing (or planning) alternatives to
   face-to-face consultations.
   Design and setting
   A postal survey of practices around Bristol, Oxford, Lothian, the
   Highlands, and the Western Isles of Scotland.
   Method
   A postal questionnaire survey was sent to each of the GPs and practice
   managers of 421 practices between January and May 2015.
   Results
   A response was received from 319/421 practices (76\%). Although the
   majority of the practices reported that they were conducting telephone
   consultations frequently (n = 211/318, 66\%), fewer were implementing
   email consultations (n = 18/318, 6\%), and most (n = 169/318, 53\%) had
   no plans to introduce this. None were currently using internet video,
   and 86\% (n = 273/318) had no plans to introduce internet video
   consultations. These findings were repeated in the reported use of
   alternatives to face-to-face consultations at an individual GP level.
   Optional free text responses were completed by 28\% of responders, and
   offered an explanation for the (often perceived) barriers and incentives
   for implementation.
   Conclusion
   Despite policy pressure to introduce consultations by email and internet
   video, there is a general reluctance among GPs to implement alternatives
   to face-to-face consultations. This identifies a substantial gap between
   rhetoric and reality in terms of the likelihood of certain alternatives
   (email, video) changing practice in the near future.}},

   care.
   Methods: A 62-item survey was conducted among 900 participants at 3
   international breastfeeding conferences. Analysis included uni-and
   bivariate descriptive statistics, categorizing of mutually exclusive
   response groups and thematic networks analysis of responses to 18
   open-ended items.
   Results: Three-hundred-and-one participants (33 \% response), from 34
   predominantly industrialized countries (98 \%) on nearly all continents,
   responded to the survey. Norwegian residents alone, felt sufficiently
   supported in providing breastfeeding support by other healthcare
   providers, the work environment, society, the media and their National
   Breastfeeding Committee (P < 0.05). Out of 11 suggested measures for
   effective breastfeeding promotion, 96 \% of respondents ranked
   integrated care as the most important. The largest response group
   identified in open-ended items, as a major barrier to integrated care in
   breastfeeding support, was ``lacking or failing health promotion
   strategies{''} (n = 454), followed by ``a lack of vertically integrated
   care{''} (n = 268), described mainly as unsatisfactory cooperation
   within healthcare. This inconsistency of care also impairs ``shared
   decision-making{''} on infant feeding for parents, including
   accessibility of information and support (n = 265). Among other
   measures, 29 \% of respondents recommended incentivizing integrated
   breastfeeding support within healthcare. Two figures, based on
   open-ended response evaluations, illustrate participants' ideas of the
   National Breastfeeding Committees' role in coordinating policies and
   protagonists towards integrated breastfeeding support, and a
   family-centered model of integrated care to facilitate successful
   breastfeeding.
   Conclusions: According to practitioners in breastfeeding support,
   integrated care is essential for successful breastfeeding. Quality and
   accessibility of breastfeeding support should be motivated by healthcare
   system incentives, to counter the reported lack of consistency of care
   within and beyond healthcare. To effectively integrate a continuum of
   breastfeeding support into healthcare and society, a policy consensus
   and strong political action are indispensable, with coordination by an
   empowered National Breastfeeding Committee.}},

Title = {{Socioeconomic Predictors of Family Forest Owner Awareness and Use of US
   Federal Income Tax Provisions}},
Journal = {{FORESTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Family forest owners (FFOs) control a majority of private forestland in
   the United States and have widely diverse ownership and management
   objectives. Many FFOs manage their holdings for timber production and,
   thus, are concerned with issues such as reforestation incentives and tax
   treatment of timber revenues. Their actual knowledge of the tax aspects
   of timber management varies, with some owners even unaware of the
   federal income tax provisions that apply to timber. This research used
   econometric techniques to establish socioeconomic predictors of FFO
   awareness and use of federal income tax provisions. Socioeconomic
   factors (such as size of forest holding, ownership objective, education,
   age, and income) were evaluated in terms of association with awareness
   and use of income tax provisions. Data were obtained from a survey of
   1350 South Carolina FFOs (472 useable responses). A two-step sample
   selection methodology revealed that membership in a landowner
   organization and size of forest holding positively influence landowner
   awareness of the seven tax provisions, while ownership objective and
   level of education exhibited varying degrees of influence. Overall, the
   findings suggest that size of forest holding is the key determinant that
   influences landowner use of the provisions. These tax incentives are one
   of the foundations of federal policies encouraging active forest
   management by FFOs and the effectiveness of the various incentives has
   crucial implications for forest policy analysis.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Health plans play a key role in facilitating improvements in
   population health and may engage in activities that have an impact on
   access, cost, and quality of behavioral health care. Although behavioral
   health care is becoming more integrated with general medical care, its
   delivery system has unique aspects. The study examined how health plans
   deliver and manage behavioral health care in the context of the
   Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the 2008 Mental Health Parity and
   Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA). This is a critical time to examine how
   health plans manage behavioral health care.
   Methods: A nationally representative survey of private health plans
   (weighted N=8,431 products; 89\% response rate) was conducted in 2010
   during the first year of MHPAEA, when plans were subject to the law but
   before final regulations, and just before the ACA went into effect. The
   survey addressed behavioral health coverage, cost-sharing, contracting
   arrangements, medical home innovations, support for technology, and
   financial incentives to improve behavioral health care.
   Results: Coverage for inpatient and outpatient behavioral health
   services was stable between 2003 and 2010. In 2010, health plans were
   more likely than in 2003 to manage behavioral health care through
   internal arrangements and to contract for other services. Medical home
   initiatives were common and almost always included behavioral health,
   but financial incentives did not. Some plans facilitated providers' use
   of technology to improve care delivery, but this was not the norm.
   Conclusions: Health plans are key to mainstreaming and supporting
   delivery of high-quality behavioral health services. Since 2003, plans
   have made changes to support delivery of behavioral health services in
   the context of a rapidly changing environment.}},

Pages = {{44-52}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Disgust can evoke strong behavioral responses. Sometimes these extreme
   visceral responses can lead to stigmatization an overreaction{''} to a
   risk. In fact, disgust may be so inhibiting that it leads people to
   refuse to consume completely safe items, such as treated drinking water,
   leading to important economic and policy implications. Using economic
   experiments, we provide a measure of the behavioral response to disgust.
   Our findings suggest that when monetary incentives are provided, the
   behavioral response may have been exaggerated by previous studies that
   have relied on survey methods. Furthermore, mitigation steps
   successfully reduce the stigma behavior. In fact, the results suggest
   that stigma is primarily reduced not by a specific mitigation step taken
   but by how many steps are taken consecutively. These results have
   important implications for policies addressing issues such as the global
   shortage of drinking water. Some efforts to resolve the shortage have
   involved recycled water that is completely safe to drink but is often
   rejected because of reactions of disgust. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier

Title = {{How do individuals' health behaviours respond to an increase in the
   supply of health care? Evidence from a natural experiment}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL SCIENCE \& MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{159}},
Pages = {{170-179}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The efficacy of the management of long-term conditions depends in part
   on whether healthcare and health behaviours are complements or
   substitutes in the health production function. On the one hand,
   individuals might believe that improved health care can raise the
   marginal productivity of their own health behaviour and decide to
   complement health care with additional effort in healthier behaviours.
   On the other hand, health care can lower the cost of unhealthy
   behaviours by compensating for their negative effects. Individuals may
   therefore reduce their effort in healthier lifestyles. Identifying which
   of these effects prevails is complicated by the endogenous nature of
   treatment decisions and individuals' behavioural responses. We explore
   whether the introduction in 2004 of the Quality and Outcomes Framework
   (QOF), a financial incentive for family doctors to improve the quality
   of healthcare, affected the population's weight, smoking and drinking
   behaviours by applying a sharp regression discontinuity design to a
   sample of 32,102 individuals in the Health Survey for England
   (1997-2009). We find that individuals with the targeted health
   conditions improved their lifestyle behaviours. This complementarity was
   only statistically significant for smoking, which reduced by 0.7
   cigarettes per person per day, equal to 18\% of the mean. We investigate
   whether this change was attributable to the QOF by testing for other
   discontinuity points, including the introduction of a smoking ban in
   2007 and changes to the QOF in 2006. We also examine whether medication
   and smoking cessation advice are potential mechanisms and find no
   statistically significant discontinuities for these aspects of health
   care supply. Our results suggest that a general improvement in
   healthcare generated by provider incentives can have positive unplanned
   effects on patients' behaviours. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by

Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{287-295}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Background: Despite strong support for its efficacy, debates persist
   about how dissemination of contingency management is most effectively
   undertaken. Currently-promoted contingency management methods are
   empirically-validated, yet their congruence with interests and
   preferences of addiction treatment clientele is unknown. Such client
   input is a foundational support for evidence-based clinical practice.
   Objective: This study documented interest in incentives and preferences
   for fixed-ratio vs. variable-ratio and immediate vs. distal distribution
   of earned incentives among clients enrolled at three community programs
   affiliated with the National Institute on Drug Abuse Clinical Trials
   Network. Methods: This multi-site study included anonymous survey
   completion by an aggregate sample of 358 treatment enrollees. Analyses
   first ruled out site differences in survey responses, and then tested
   age and gender as influences on client interest in financial incentives,
   and preferences for fixed-ratio vs. variable-ratio reinforcement and
   immediate vs. distal incentive distribution. Results: Interest in
   different types of \$50 incentives (i.e. retail vouchers, transportation
   vouchers, cash) was highly inter-correlated, with a mean sample rating
   of 3.49 (0.83) on a five-point scale. While consistent across client
   gender, age was an inverse predictor of client interest in incentives. A
   majority of clients stated preference for fixed-ratio incentive
   magnitude and distal incentive distribution (67\% and 63\%,
   respectively), with these preferences voiced by a larger proportion of
   females. Conclusion: Sample preferences contradict currently-promoted
   contingency management design features. Future efforts to disseminate
   contingency management may be more successful if flexibly undertaken in
   a manner that incorporates the interests and preferences of local client
   populations.}},

   workplace initiatives in Australia}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{APR 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: Worksite health promotion (WHP) initiatives are increasingly
   seen as having potential for large-scale health gains. While health
   insurance premiums are directly linked to workplaces in the USA, other
   countries with universal health coverage, have less incentive to
   implement WHP programs. Size of the business is an important
   consideration with small worksites less likely to implement WHP
   programs. The aim of this study was to identify key intervention points
   and to provide policy makers with evidence for targeted interventions.
   Methods: The worksites (n = 218) of randomly selected, working
   participants, aged between 30 and 65 years, in two South Australian
   cohort studies were surveyed to assess the practices, beliefs, and
   attitudes regarding WHP. A survey was sent electronically or by mail to
   management within each business.
   Results: Smaller businesses (< 20 employees) had less current health
   promotion activies (mean 1.0) compared to medium size businesses (20-200
   employees -mean 2.4) and large businesses (200+ employees -mean 2.9).
   Management in small businesses were less likely (31.0 \%) to believe
   that health promotion belonged in the workplace (compared to 55.7 \% of
   medium businesses and 73.9 \% of large businesses) although half of
   small businesses did not know or were undecided (compared to 36.4 and
   21.6 \% of medium and large businesses). In total, 85.0 \% of smaller
   businesses believed the health promotion activities currently employed
   in the worksite were effective (compared to 89.2 \% of medium businesses
   and 83.1 \% of large businesses). Time and funding were themost cited
   responses to the challenges to implementing health promoting strategies
   regardless of business size. Small businesses ranked morale and
   work/life balance the highest among a range of health promotion
   activities that were important for their workplace while work-related
   injury was the highest ranked consideration for large businesses.
   Conclusion: This study found that smaller workplaces had many barriers,
   beliefs and challenges regarding WHP. Often small businesses find health
   promotion activities a luxury and not a serious focus of their
   activities although this study found that once a health promoting
   strategy was employed, the perceived effectiveness of the activities
   were high for all business regardless of size. Tailored low-cost
   programs, tax incentives, re-orientation of work practices and
   management support are required so that the proportion of small
   businesses that have WHP initiatives is increased.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction:Obtaining complete and timely subject data is key to the
   success of clinical trials, particularly for studies requiring data
   collected from subjects at home or other remote sites. A multifaceted
   strategy for data collection in a randomized controlled trial (RCT)
   focused on care coordination for children with medical complexity is
   described. The influences of data collection mode, incentives, and study
   group membership on subject response patterns are analyzed. Data
   collection included monthly healthcare service utilization (HCSU)
   calendars and annual surveys focused on care coordination
   outcomes.Materials and Methods:One hundred sixty-three families were
   enrolled in the 30-month TeleFamilies RCT. Subjects were 2-15 years of
   age at enrollment. HCSU data were collected by parent/guardian
   self-report using mail, e-mail, telephone, or texting. Surveys were
   collected by mail. Incentives were provided for completed surveys after
   8 months to improve collection returns. Outcome measures were the number
   of HCSU calendars and surveys returned, the return interval, data
   collection mode, and incentive impact. Results:Return rates of 90\% for
   HCSU calendars and 82\% for annual surveys were achieved. Mean return
   intervals were 72 and 65 days for HCSU and surveys, respectively. Survey
   response increased from 55\% to 95\% after introduction of a gift card
   and added research staff.Conclusions:High return rates for HCSU
   calendars and health-related surveys are attainable but required a
   flexible and personnel-intensive approach to collection methods. Family
   preference for data collection approach should be obtained at
   enrollment, should be modified as needed, and requires flexible options,
   training, intensive staff/family interaction, and patience.}},

   important in survey-based research. However, evidence on the response
   rate effect of donation incentives and especially altruistic and
   egotistic text appeal interventions is sparse and ambiguous. Via a
   randomized survey experiment among 6,162 members of an online survey
   panel, this article shows how low-cost incentives and cost-free text
   appeal interventions may affect the survey response rate in online
   panels. The experimental treatments comprise (a) a cash prize lottery
   incentive, (b) two donation incentives that promise a monetary donation
   to a good cause in return for survey response, (c) an egotistic text
   appeal, and (d) an altruistic text appeal. Relative to a control group,
   we find higher response rates among recipients of the egotistic text
   appeal and the lottery incentive. Donation incentives yield lower
   response rates.}},

Abstract = {{Redundancy is a four-letter word. According to courts and scholars,
   redundant litigation is costly, unfair, and confounding. Modern civil
   procedure has a ( nearly) maximalist preference for centralization, and
   various rules seek to limit duplicative suits within and across court
   systems. This seemingly dominant view stands in marked contrast to the
   reality of the modern regulatory state. Redundant public-private
   enforcement, in which public and private actors have overlapping
   authority to enforce the law, is ubiquitous. Redundant enforcement also
   is noticeably underrepresented in the substantial literature on private
   and public enforcement, which typically treats government agencies and
   private attorneys general as substitutes rather than complements.
   This Article seeks to fill these gaps. It begins with a survey of the
   myriad forms of redundant enforcement in U.S. law, and then turns to a
   defense of redundant public-private enforcement. Scholars of engineering
   and public administration have built up a powerful literature on the
   potential uses of redundancy, and this Article applies those insights to
   overlapping public and private enforcement in U.S. law. Drawing on those
   literatures, this Article derives principles of redundant enforcement
   that account for the diversity of agents and the potential for strategic
   behavior. It argues that redundancy may be an effective response to
   errors, resource constraints, information problems, and agency costs, if
   redundant-enforcement regimes harness multiple diverse agents and are
   tailored to the relevant regulatory environment. Specifically, if the
   lawmaker worries that public or private agents are missing good cases,
   redundant authority may help to reduce errors, increase resources,
   aggregate information, and improve monitoring-though permitting
   duplicative suits may undercut these gains. Meanwhile, if the lawmaker
   is concerned about under-enforcing settlements or judgments,
   symmetrically non-preclusive redundant litigation may be a valuable
   tool-though damages should offset to avoid multiple punishments, and
   procedural rules should maintain incentives and allocate cases.}},

Title = {{Luxembourgish farmers' lack of information about grain legume
   cultivation}},
Journal = {{AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Grain legume production in Europe has decreased in recent years, while
   legume demand has rapidly increased due to growth of meat production.
   Therefore, Europe imports grain legumes, principally soybeans, to meet
   feed protein requirements. Various investigations have identified
   problems and benefits of local grain legume cultivation. Nevertheless,
   grain legume cultivation has still not increased in the last years.
   Studies investigating why farmers do not cultivate grain legumes are
   missing. Here, we surveyed the knowledge of farmers about grain legume
   cultivation, problems and constraints of grain legume cultivation and
   the barriers faced by and incentives needed by farmers. We sent a
   questionnaire to 1373 farmers in Luxembourg, with a response rate of 29
   \%. Results show that only 17 \% of all the responding farmers
   cultivated grain legumes; 88 \% of the conventional farmers did not
   cultivate grain legumes, while 85 \% of the organic farmers did. We
   observed that Luxembourgish farmers feel badly informed about grain
   legume cultivation; organic farmers generally feel better informed than
   their conventional colleagues. The main barrier, named by Luxemburgish
   farmers to not cultivate grain legumes, is not economic issues but a
   lack of knowledge and extension services for these crops. Main
   incentives needed to start grain legume cultivation in the future are
   economic issues. Even though grain legume producers mentioned several
   negative experiences with grain legume cultivation, they are not
   discouraged by the poor economic conditions and appreciate the benefits
   of grain legume cultivation. Overall, our findings show that research
   results on grain legume should be better disseminated to extension
   services and farmers.}},

Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Pages = {{175-181}},
Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{Context:
   Health information technology (IT) has the potential to improve the
   nation's public health infrastructure. In support of this belief,
   meaningful use incentives include criteria for hospitals to
   electronically report to immunization registries, as well as to public
   health agencies for reportable laboratory results and syndromic
   surveillance. Electronic reporting can facilitate faster and more
   appropriate public health response. However, it remains unclear the
   extent that hospitals have adopted IT for public health efforts.
   Objective:
   To examine hospital adoption of IT for public health and to compare
   hospitals capable of using and not using public health IT.
   Design:
   Cross-sectional design with data from the 2012 American Hospital
   Association annual survey matched with data from the 2013 American
   Hospital Association Information Technology Supplement. Multivariate
   logistic regression was used to compare hospital characteristics.
   Inverse probability weights were applied to adjust for selection bias
   because of survey nonresponse.
   Participants:
   All acute care general hospitals in the United States that matched
   across the surveys and had complete data available were included in the
   analytic sample.
   Main Outcome Measures:
   Three separate outcome measures were used: whether the hospital could
   electronically report to immunization registries, whether the hospital
   could send electronic laboratory results, and whether the hospital can
   participate in syndromic surveillance.
   Results:
   A total of 2841 hospitals met the inclusion criteria. Weighted results
   show that of these hospitals, 62.7\% can electronically submit to
   immunization registries, 56.6\% can electronically report laboratory
   results, and 54.4\% can electronically report syndromic surveillance.
   Adjusted and weighted results from the multivariate analyses show that
   small, rural hospitals and hospitals without electronic health record
   systems lag in the adoption of public health IT capabilities.
   Conclusion:
   While a majority of hospitals are using public health IT, the
   infrastructure still has significant room for growth. Differences in
   hospitals' adoption of public health IT may exacerbate existing health
   disparities.}},

Journal = {{ACADEMIC PEDIATRICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{200-207}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: From 2009 to 2010, 12 accountable care organizations (ACOs)
   entered into the alternative quality contract (AQC), BlueCross
   BlueShield of Massachusetts's global payment arrangement. The AQC
   included 6 outpatient pediatric quality measures among 64 total measures
   tied to pay-for-performance bonuses and incorporated pediatric
   populations in their global budgets. We characterized the pediatric
   infrastructure of these adult-oriented ACOs and obtained leaders'
   perspectives on their ACOs' response to pediatric incentives.
   METHODS: We used Massachusetts Health Quality Partners and American
   Hospital Association Survey data to characterize ACOs' pediatric
   infrastructure as extremely limited, basic, and substantial on the basis
   of the extent of pediatric primary care, outpatient specialist, and
   inpatient services. After ACOs had 16 to 43 months of experience with
   the AQC, we interviewed 22 leaders to gain insight into how
   organizations made changes to improve pediatric care quality, tried to
   reduce pediatric spending, and addressed care for children with special
   health care needs.
   RESULTS: ACOs' pediatric infrastructure ranged from extremely limited
   (eg, no general pediatricians in their primary care workforce) to
   substantial (eg, 42\% of workforce was general pediatricians). Most
   leaders reported intensifying their pediatric quality improvement
   efforts and witnessing changes in quality metrics; most also
   investigated pediatric spending patterns but struggled to change
   patients' utilization patterns. All reported that the AQC did little to
   incentivize care for children with special health care needs and that
   future incentive programs should include this population.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although ACOs involved in the AQC were adult-oriented, most
   augmented their pediatric quality improvement and spending reduction
   efforts when faced with pediatric incentives.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{341-346}},
Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{Background: Recent years have seen significant growth in part-time work
   among pharmacy personnel. If preferences and outlooks of part-time and
   full-time workers differ, job-related incentives may not have the same
   effect on both groups; different management practices may be necessary
   to cope with rapidly evolving workforces.
   Objective: To compare wage-and-salary responses to the number of hours
   worked, human-capital stock, and job-related preferences between
   full-time and part-time pharmacists. The analysis focused on the
   pharmacist workforce because, unlike other professions, remuneration is
   fairly linear with respect to the amount of time worked.
   Methods: Data were collected from a self-reported survey of licensed
   pharmacists in southern Florida (U.S. State). The sample consisted of
   979 full-time and 254 part-time respondents. Using ordinary least
   squares, a model estimated, separately for full-time and part-time
   pharmacists, annual wage-and-salary earnings as functions of average
   workweek, human-capital stock, and job-related preferences.
   Results: Practitioners working less than 36 h/week were driven almost
   exclusively by pay, whereas practitioners working 36 h or more exhibited
   a more comprehensive approach to their work experience that included
   variables beyond monetary remuneration.
   Conclusion: Managing part-time pharmacists calls for emphasis on
   wage-and-salary issues. Job-security and gender-and children-related
   concerns, such as flexibility, should be oriented toward full-time
   practitioners. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A decentralized approach to encourage the voluntary adoption of
   household stormwater management practices is increasingly needed to
   mitigate urban runoff and to comply with more stringent water quality
   regulations. We analyze the household response to a hypothetical rebate
   program to incentivize rain garden adoption using household survey data
   from the Baltimore-Washington corridor. We asked respondents whether the
   household would adopt a rain garden without a rebate or when offered a
   randomly assigned rebate. An interval-data model is used to estimate
   household demand on the willingness to pay (WTP) for a rain garden as a
   function of demographic factors, gardening activities, environmental
   attitudes, and other household characteristics. Estimation results
   indicate that mean WTP for a rain garden in our sample population is
   approximately \$6.72 per square foot, corresponding to almost
   three-fourths of the installation cost. The expected adoption rate more
   than tripled when comparing no rebate versus a government rebate set at
   one-third of the installation cost, indicating that economic incentives
   matter. There is substantial heterogeneity in the WTP among households.
   Higher levels of WTP are estimated for households with higher
   environmental concern for the Chesapeake Bay and local streams, garden
   experience, higher income, and non-senior citizen adults. We conclude
   that a cost-share rebate approach is likely to significantly affect
   household adoption decisions, and the partial contributions paid by
   households can assist with lowering the substantial compliance costs for
   local governments to meet water quality requirements.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Modern construction projects often include incentive/disincentive (I/D)
   provisions in order to serve a variety of different client objectives.
   Studies have shown both the advantages and disadvantages of using I/D
   clauses to improve performance. In India, out of 82 construction
   projects of varied size and nature investigated, only 14 projects of a
   critical nature were found to have I/D clauses in their contract
   document. The present study was carried out to identify various
   attributes affecting the successful use of I/D clauses in achieving
   their intended purpose. A total of 25 attributes were identified based
   on a literature review and structured personal interviews that present
   practical difficulties while using the I/D contracting method and thus,
   prevent I/D clauses from unlocking their true potential. These
   attributes have been evaluated based on the results of a survey
   conducted among experienced professionals working in the Indian
   construction industry. Factor analysis conducted on responses associated
   with important attributes identified five key factors: difficulty in
   contract management, additional effort by project participants, adverse
   effect on the working relationship of the client and contractor,
   increased responsibility of the client, and client's reluctant top
   management. These factors also explain the reason behind the low
   acceptance of the I/D contracting method in developing construction
   markets. Case studies performed in four construction projects show that
   three out of four projects discussed were delayed due to inadequate
   understanding and wrong implementation of I/D provisions. This paper
   will be of interest to academicians and practitioners interested in the
   use of the I/D contracting method in construction projects. (C) 2015

Journal = {{TRIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{JAN 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: Childhood obesity is a concern in Australia and across the
   world. Community-based weight management programs are an important
   response to address childhood obesity. However, the scientific
   literature suggests that their effectiveness could potentially be
   enhanced by providing a structured incentive scheme. This proposal aims
   to determine the effectiveness of enhanced goal setting linked to a
   structured incentive scheme designed to improve the sustained health and
   wellbeing of overweight/obese children within the context of an existing
   community-based program.
   Methods/Design: This study is a cluster randomized controlled trial
   delivered within the context of the existing NSW ``Go4Fun{''} program
   with a 10-week and 6-and 12-month follow-up (n = 40 sites, 570
   participants) that compares the effectiveness of small changes to the
   program in which children were asked to set goals (supported by text
   messages) and were given rewards for achieving them (intervention). This
   will be compared to the standard/existing program (control), which did
   not have the same structured incentive program. Data will be collected
   for all participants at baseline, end of program, and at 6 and 12
   months. The primary outcome is a mean change in body mass index (BMI) z
   score at the 12-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes include
   anthropometric measures (body weight, height, and waist circumference)
   and behavioral measures collected via validated questionnaires. A
   process evaluation (comprising surveys and focus groups) to determine
   acceptability and sustainability and to inform downstream translation
   will also be conducted.
   Discussion: This study will inform policy and program delivery as well
   as the broader evidence base regarding goal achievement and incentive
   schemes directed at children's health-related behaviors and will provide
   evidence that is likely to be transferrable across a range of health

Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{JAN 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: With the widespread use of information communication
   technologies, computerized clinical practice guidelines are developed
   and considered as effective decision supporting tools in assisting the
   processes of clinical activities. However, the development of
   computerized clinical practice guidelines in Taiwan is still at the
   early stage and acceptance level among major users (physicians) of
   computerized clinical practice guidelines is not satisfactory. This
   study aims to investigate critical factors influencing physicians'
   intention to computerized clinical practice guideline use through an
   integrative model of activity theory and the technology acceptance
   model.
   Methods: The survey methodology was employed to collect data from
   physicians of the investigated hospitals that have implemented
   computerized clinical practice guidelines. A total of 505 questionnaires
   were sent out, with 238 completed copies returned, indicating a valid
   response rate of 47.1 \%. The collected data was then analyzed by
   structural equation modeling technique.
   Results: The results showed that attitudes toward using computerized
   clinical practice guidelines (gamma = 0.451, p < 0.001), organizational
   support (gamma = 0.285, p < 0.001), perceived usefulness of computerized
   clinical practice guidelines (gamma = 0.219, p < 0.05), and social
   influence (gamma = 0.213, p < 0.05) were critical factors influencing
   physicians' intention to use computerized clinical practice guidelines,
   and these factors can explain 68.6 \% of the variance in intention to
   use computerized clinical practice guidelines.
   Conclusions: This study confirmed that some subject (human) factors,
   environment (organization) factors, tool (technology) factors mentioned
   in the activity theory should be carefully considered when introducing
   computerized clinical practice guidelines. Managers should pay much
   attention on those identified factors and provide adequate resources and
   incentives to help the promotion and use of computerized clinical
   practice guidelines. Through the appropriate use of computerized
   clinical practice guidelines, the clinical benefits, particularly in
   improving quality of care and facilitating the clinical processes, will
   be realized.}},

Title = {{Views from senior Australian cancer researchers on evaluating the impact
   of their research: results from a brief survey}},
Journal = {{HEALTH RESEARCH POLICY AND SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{JAN 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: The interest and activity in measuring and reporting the
   impact of publicly funded health and medical research has grown rapidly
   in recent years. Research evaluation typically relies on researchers for
   much of the information for an impact assessment. However, the
   acceptability and feasibility of this activity among health researchers
   is unknown. The aim of this study was to understand the role and
   opinions of cancer researchers in the growing area of impact evaluation
   activity, to inform the logistics of a sustainable program of impact
   evaluation.
   Methods: A brief anonymous online survey was administered to 95 current
   and past grant recipients funded through the external grants program at
   Cancer Council New South Wales. Eleven survey statements were
   constructed with Likert responses and supplemented with two open-ended
   questions. The statements covered the conceptual, attitudinal and
   practical aspects of impact evaluation. The survey targeted researchers
   from the full spectrum of cancer control research classifications.
   Descriptive analyses obtained response frequencies and percentages.
   Results: Forty-five cancer researchers completed the survey (response
   rate 47\%) and 77\% were Associate Professors or Professors. Responses
   were polarised for questions relating to engaging with research
   end-users, perceived time-pressure to collate data, and pressure to
   produce research outputs. Some researchers emphasised that quality was
   an important goal over quantity and warned that collecting impact data
   created incentives and disincentives for researchers.
   Conclusion: There was mixed support and acceptance among senior cancer
   researchers in Australia on their perceived role and engagement with
   research impact activities. Sole reliance on researchers for collating
   and reporting impact data may be problematic. Requesting information
   from researchers could be minimised and confined to final reports and
   possible verification of externally-led evaluations.}},

Abstract = {{The tobacco epidemic disproportionately affects low-income populations,
   and telehealth is an evidence-based strategy for extending tobacco
   cessation services to underserved populations. A public health priority
   is to establish incentive-based interventions at the population level in
   order to promote long-term smoking cessation in low-income populations.
   Yet randomized clinical trials show that financial incentives tend to
   encourage only short-term steps of cessation, not continuous smoking
   abstinence. One potential mechanism for increasing long-term cessation
   is interpersonal communication (IPC) in response to population-level
   interventions. However, more research is needed on IPC and its influence
   on health behavior change, particularly in the context of
   incentive-based, population-level programs. This study used survey data
   gathered after a population-level telehealth intervention that offered
   \$20 incentives to low-income smokers for being connected to Minnesota's
   free quitline in order to examine how perceived incentive importance and
   IPC about the incentive-based program relate to both short-term and
   long-term health behavior change. Results showed that IPC was strongly
   associated with initial quitline utilization and continuous smoking
   abstinence as measured by 30-day point prevalence rates at 7-month
   follow-up. Perceived incentive importance had weak associations with
   both measures of cessation, and all associations were nonsignificant in
   models adjusting for IPC. These results were found in descriptive
   analyses, logistic regression models, and Heckman probit models that
   adjusted for participant recruitment. In sum, a behavioral telehealth
   intervention targeting low-income smokers that offered a financial
   incentive inspired IPC, and this social response was strongly related to
   utilization of intervention services as well as continuous smoking
   abstinence.}},

   perspectives}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2795-2819}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this study was to provide a holistic view of
   exhibition destination attractiveness by examining perceptions of two of
   the three key stakeholders (exhibition organizers and visitors) and
   contrasting them with those of exhibitors.
   Design/methodology/approach - This research used a mixed method
   approach, collecting 535 responses from visitors attending nine
   business-to-business exhibitions in four major cities in China via
   structured surveys. In addition, eight in-depth interviews with
   CEOs/owners of leading global and Chinese exhibition companies were
   conducted.
   Findings - The findings revealed that exhibitors may go almost anywhere
   where there is potential for successful business. In contrast, visitors
   prefer exhibition destinations with good accessibility to minimize
   travel time and an attractive leisure environment that offers a degree
   of enjoyment in addition to taking care of business. A destination's
   ``economic environment{''} and ``cluster effects{''} were comparatively
   less important to them. Organizers were cognizant of these differences,
   contributing to their reluctance in taking large-scale, branded
   exhibitions to second-tier destinations, despite considerable efforts by
   these cities to improve their infrastructure.
   Practical implications - This study offers practical guidelines for
   destination administrators and exhibition organizers with regard to
   evaluating destination resources for long-term exhibition development.
   Originality/value - In contrast to prior studies, this research
   identifies significant differences in perceptions of exhibition
   destination attractiveness among all three key industry stakeholders. It
   also presents a persuasive case for the need to clearly differentiate
   between the attractiveness of a destination for attracting/hosting
   exhibitions versus conventions, rather than approaching the subject from
   a more generic meetings, incentives, conferences, and exhibitions (MICE)
   segment/business events perspective.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe the current landscape
   of health information technology (HIT) in early accountable care
   organizations (ACOs), the different strategies ACOs are using to develop
   HIT-based capabilities, and how ACOs are using these capabilities within
   their care management processes to advance health outcomes for their
   patient population.
   Design/methodology/approach - Mixed methods study pairing data from a
   cross-sectional National Survey of ACOs with in-depth, semi-structured
   interviews with leaders from 11 ACOs (both completed in 2013).
   Findings - Early ACOs vary widely in their electronic health record,
   data integration, and analytic capabilities. The most common HIT
   capability was drug-drug and drug-allergy interaction checks, with 53.2
   percent of respondents reporting that the ACO possessed the capability
   to a high degree. Outpatient and inpatient data integration was the
   least common HIT capability (8.1 percent). In the interviews, ACO
   leaders commented on different HIT development strategies to gain a more
   comprehensive picture of patient needs and service utilization. ACOs
   realize the necessity for robust data analytics, and are exploring a
   variety of approaches to achieve it.
   Research limitations/implications - Data are self-reported. The
   qualitative portion was based on interviews with 11 ACOs, limiting
   generalizability to the universe of ACOs but allowing for a range of
   responses.
   Practical implications - ACOs are challenged with the development of
   sophisticated HIT infrastructure. They may benefit from targeted
   assistance and incentives to implement health information exchanges with
   other providers to promote more coordinated care management for their
   patient population.
   Originality/value - Using new empirical data, this study increases
   understanding of the extent of ACOs' current and developing HIT
   capabilities to support ongoing care management.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{43-64}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Research on trustworthiness and trust behavior so far has followed
   different methodological approaches and has generated conflicting
   evidence regarding their interrelationships. While several authors
   follow the definition of trustworthiness as a belief or a formed
   expectancy by Person A about Person B to do X (usually to reward trust),
   different hypotheses can be derived regarding its formation, depending
   on whether one treats trustworthiness as incentive-based or as a
   propensity or disposition. Additionally, distinct measurement approaches
   for trustworthiness exist, depending on the mode of data collection.
   With theoretical claims that trustworthiness represents ``the crucial
   variable{''} (Hardin in Trust, 2006) for understanding and explaining
   successful cooperation based on trust, the article proposes the use of
   para-data in the form of response latency measurement to enhance the
   understanding of the thought processes behind forming an assessment of
   trustworthiness. The study uses pooled data from two CATI surveys
   conducted in Germany in 2012 to test hypotheses on the underlying
   cognitive process of forming an expectation of trustworthiness by
   applying the techniques of both response latency measurement and Cox
   regression models. We find that the applied survey measures of
   trustworthiness generate inconsistent results regarding the underlying
   process of forming expectations. Consequences for future research are

Abstract = {{Introduction: Biochemical confirmation (BC) of self-report is the gold
   standard of evidence for abstinence in smoking cessation research, but
   difficulty in obtaining samples may bias estimates of quit rates. Proxy
   confirmation (PC) has not been validated in cessation trials. We
   assessed the feasibility and validity of PC in a cessation trial for
   hospitalized smokers.
   Methods: We enrolled 402 daily cigarette smokers during a hospital
   admission. At enrollment, participants provided demographics, smoking
   history, and named proxies to confirm their smoking status at follow-up.
   Participants provided self-reported (SR) 7-day tobacco abstinence by
   telephone at 6 months post-discharge. SR quitters were asked to mail a
   saliva sample for BC. Incentives were offered for survey completion (\$
   20) and returned samples (\$ 50). We called proxies for all those with
   SR to obtain PC. Quit rates were calculated with missing data indicating
   smoking. We assessed associations of nonresponse with baseline
   characteristics using chi-squared tests and logistic regression. We
   calculated the sensitivity and specificity of PC in detecting smokers as
   determined by BC.
   Results: All patients named at least one proxy. Response rates were 82\%
   for SR, 84\% for PC, and 69\% for BC. Observed participant
   characteristics were unrelated to provision of sample for BC. Estimated
   quit rates were 35\% for SR, 27\% for SR + PC, 21\% for SR + BC and 27\%
   for SR + BC or PC. Sensitivity of PC was not higher than SR (73\% vs.
   77\%); specificity was lower (84\% vs. 100\%).
   Conclusion: PC was feasible but not superior to self-report in a
   cessation trial.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE In the turbulent US health care environment, many primary care
   physicians seek hospital employment. Large physician-owned primary care
   groups are an alternative, but few physicians or policy makers realize
   that such groups exist. We wanted to describe these groups, their
   advantages, and their challenges.
   METHODS We identified 21 groups and studied 5 that varied in size and
   location. We conducted interviews with group leaders, surveyed randomly
   selected group physicians, and interviewed external observers-leaders of
   a health plan, hospital, and specialty medical group that shared
   patients with the group. We triangulated responses from group leaders,
   group physicians, and external observers to identify key themes.
   RESULTS The groups' physicians work in small practices, with the group
   providing economies of scale necessary to develop laboratory and imaging
   services, health information technology, and quality improvement
   infrastructure. The groups differ in their size and the extent to which
   they engage in value-based contracting, though all are moving to
   increase the amount of financial risk they take for their quality and
   cost performance. Unlike hospital-employed and multispecialty groups,
   independent primary care groups can aim to reduce health care costs
   without conflicting incentives to fill hospital beds and keep specialist
   incomes high. Each group was positively regarded by external observers.
   The groups are under pressure, however, to sell to organizations that
   can provide capital for additional infrastructure to engage in
   value-based contracting, as well as provide substantial income to
   physicians from the sale.
   CONCLUSIONS Large, independent primary care groups have the potential to
   make primary care attractive to physicians and to improve patient care
   by combining human scale advantages of physician autonomy and the small
   practice setting with resources that are important to succeed in
   value-based contracting.}},

Journal = {{ANNALS OF PLASTIC SURGERY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{76}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{3-5}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Web-based surveys save time and money. As electronic
   questionnaires have increased in popularity, telephone and mailed
   surveys have declined. With any survey, a response rate of 75\% or
   greater is critical for the validity of any study. We wanted to
   determine which survey method achieved the highest response among
   academic plastic surgeons.
   Methods: All American Association of Plastic Surgeons members were
   surveyed regarding authorship issues. They were randomly assigned to
   receive the questionnaire through 1 of 4 methods: (A) emailed with a
   link to an online survey; (B) regular mail; (C) regular mail + \$1 bill,
   and (D) regular mail + \$5 bill. Two weeks after the initial mailing,
   the number of responses was collected, and nonresponders were contacted
   to remind them to participate. The study was closed after 10 weeks.
   Survey costs were calculated based on the actual cost of sending the
   initial survey, including stationary, printing, postage (groups B-D),
   labor, and cost of any financial incentives. Cost of reminders to
   nonresponders was calculated at \$5 per reminder, giving a total survey
   cost.
   Results: Of 662 surveys sent, 54 were returned because of incorrect
   address/email, retirement, or death. Four hundred seventeen of the
   remaining 608 surveys were returned and analyzed. The response rate was
   lowest in the online group and highest in those mailed with a monetary
   incentive.
   Conclusions: Despite the convenience and low initial cost of web-based
   surveys, this generated the lowest response. We obtained statistically
   significant response rates (79\% and 84\%) only by using postal mail
   with monetary incentives and reminders. The inclusion of a \$1 bill
   represented the greatest value and cost-effective survey method, based

Abstract = {{Neurosurgical training aims at educating future generations of
   specialist neurosurgeons and at providing the highest-quality medical
   services to patients. Attaining and maintaining these highest standards
   constitutes a major responsibility of academic or other training medical
   centers.
   An electronic survey was sent to European neurosurgical residents
   between 06/2014 and 03/2015. Multiple logistic regression analysis was
   used to assess the effect size of the relationship between
   responder-specific variables (e.g., age, gender, postgraduate year
   (PGY), country) and the outcomes (e.g., satisfaction).
   A total of 652 responses were collected, of which n = 532 were taken
   into consideration. Eighty-five percent were 26-35 years old, 76 \%
   male, 62 \% PGY 4 or higher, and 73.5 \% working at a university clinic.
   Satisfaction rates with theoretical education such as clinical lectures
   (overall: 50.2 \%), anatomical lectures (31.2 \%), amongst others,
   differed largely between the EANS member countries. Likewise,
   satisfaction rates with practical aspects of training such as hands-on
   surgical experience (overall: 73.9 \%), microsurgical training (52.5
   \%), simulator training (13.4 \%), amongst others, were highly
   country-dependant. In general, 89.1 \% of European residents carried out
   the first surgical procedure under supervision within the first year of
   training. Supervised lumbar-/cervical spine surgeries were performed by
   78.2 and 17.9 \% of European residents within 12 and 24 months of
   training, respectively, and 54.6 \% of European residents operate a
   cranial case within the first 36 months of training. Logistic regression
   analysis identified countries where residents were much more or much
   less likely to operate as primary surgeons compared to the European
   average. The caseload of craniotomies per trainee (overall: 30.6 \% a
   parts per thousand yen10 craniotomies/month) and spinal procedures
   (overall: 29.7 \% a parts per thousand yen10 spinal surgeries/month)
   varied throughout the countries and was significantly associated with
   more advanced residency (craniotomy: OR 1.35, 95 \% CI 1.18-1.53, p <
   0.001; spinal surgery: OR 1.37, 95 \% CI 1.20-1.57, p < 0.001).
   Theoretical and practical aspects of neurosurgical training are highly
   variable throughout European countries, despite some efforts within the
   last two decades to harmonize this. Some countries are rated
   significantly above (and others significantly below) the current
   European average for several analyzed parameters. It is hoped that the
   results of this survey should provide the incentive as well as the
   opportunity for a critical analysis of the local conditions for all
   training centers, but especially those in countries scoring
   significantly below the European average.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper was to evaluate the impact of a
   competition-based intervention combining high-resolution electricity
   feedback, incentives, information and prompts on college dormitory
   residents' energy consumption and participation in demand response
   events. The authors also investigated changes in individual-level
   pro-environmental behaviors and examined psychosocial correlates of
   behavior change.
   Design/methodology/approach - Residents of 39 suites in a freshman
   residence hall competed against one another to reduce energy consumption
   and win prizes as part of a three-week competition. Feedback was
   provided in near real-time at the suite-level via an interactive
   touch-screen kiosk. Participants also completed baseline and follow-up
   surveys.
   Findings - Electricity use among all suites was approximately 6.4 per
   cent lower during the competition period compared to baseline, a
   significant reduction. Additionally, participants reported engaging in
   various pro-environmental behaviors significantly more frequently during
   the competition relative to baseline. Changes in pro-environmental
   behavior were associated with changes in level of group identification
   and perceived social norms.
   Practical implications - In three weeks, dormitory residents saved 3,158
   kWh of electricity compared to baseline - the equivalent of more than
   3,470 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions. The findings provide evidence
   that real-time feedback, combined with incentives, information and
   prompts, can motivate on-campus residents to reduce energy consumption.
   Originality/value - The authors contribute to a limited body of evidence
   supporting the effectiveness of dorm energy competitions in motivating
   college students to save energy. In addition, the authors identified
   individual-level behavioral and psychosocial changes made during such an
   intervention. University residential life planners may also use the

Abstract = {{As researchers increasingly use mail survey methods to collect health
   and other data, research focused on optimizing features of survey design
   and administration in cost-effective ways is needed. We conducted two
   studies to examine the effects of sequential prepaid incentives and
   envelope messaging on response rates, item nonresponse, and costs in two
   mail surveys using address-based samples. Sample members in study 1 were
   randomly assigned to groups that received a preincentive of \$2 versus
   \$5, a second incentive of \$0 versus \$2 (sent only to nonresponders),
   and an envelope bearing no message or a monetary-focused message.
   Results indicated that the \$5 preincentive significantly increased
   response rates, but neither the second incentive nor the message had an
   effect. Informed by the results of study 1, study 2 delivered a \$2
   preincentive to all sample members, but increased the amount of the
   second incentive to \$5. Study 2 also tested a health-focused envelope
   message. While envelope messaging again failed to motivate
   participation, the administration of a second incentive, valued at a
   larger amount than the preincentive, significantly increased response
   rates. With regard to their effects on item nonresponse, while none of
   the variables was associated with item-missing levels in study 2, a
   significant three-way interaction was found in study 1 such that missing
   data was higher in the presence of a monetary message when a \$2
   preincentive was paired with a \$2 second incentive. Cost analyses
   indicated that while larger incentives increased response rates, they
   also increased costs.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluate incentives for residential energy upgrades in Italy using
   data from an original survey of Italian homeowners. In this paper,
   attention is restricted to heating system replacements, and to the
   effect of monetary and non-monetary incentives on the propensity to
   replace the heating equipment with a more efficient one. To get around
   adverse selection and free riding issues, we ask stated preference
   questions to those who weren't planning energy efficiency upgrades any
   time soon. We argue that these persons are not affected by these
   behaviors. We use their responses to fit an energy-efficiency
   renovations curve that predicts the share of the population that will
   undertake these improvements for any given incentive level. This curve
   is used to estimate the CO2 emissions saved and their
   cost-effectiveness. Respondents are more likely to agree to a
   replacement when the savings on the energy bills are larger and
   experienced over a longer horizon, and when rebates are offered to them.
   Reminding the respondents about possible CO2 emissions reductions (our
   non-monetary incentive) had little effect. Even under optimistic
   assumptions, monetary incentives similar to those in the Italian tax
   credit program are generally not cost-effective.

Abstract = {{Purpose
   The purpose of this study is to: (1) assess implementation of
   evidence-based programs and policies (EBPPs) related to diabetes
   prevention and control in local health departments, (2) assess
   feasibility of non-implemented diabetes prevention and control EBPPs,
   and (3) examine individual- and organizational-level factors associated
   with implementation of diabetes prevention and control EBPPs.
   Methods
   An online survey was administered in January 2015 to key representatives
   of all local health departments in Missouri. Descriptive statistics were
   used to describe implementation and perceived feasibility of 20 diabetes
   prevention and control EBPPs. Logistic regression was used to examine
   the association between individual and organizational factors and
   diabetes prevention and control EBPP implementation.
   Results
   One hundred local health departments participated (89\% response rate)
   in the online survey. Most frequently implemented diabetes-related EBPPs
   in local health departments included: nutrition education for agency or
   community members, increased fruit and vegetable access in community
   settings, and community-wide campaigns to promote physical activity.
   Increased encouragement to others in the department to use
   evidence-based decision making and agency incentives to help employees
   use evidence-based decision making were positively associated with
   implementation of diabetes prevention and control EBPPs.
   Conclusions
   Local health departments are on the ``front line{''} of public health,
   and this study demonstrates the important role these organizations play
   in implementing diabetes prevention and control EBPPs. Potential
   leverage points for more widespread adoption of diabetes-related EBPPs
   in local health departments include education about and encouragement of
   evidence-based decision making and organizational incentives for
   employees to integrate evidence-based decision making into their
   diabetes prevention and control activities.}},

   incentive and advantageous selection effects, with the average treatment

Abstract = {{Purpose: There is a lack of information regarding clinical practice
   models and faculty compensation plans used by dental school-based
   departments of oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMS) and their
   effectiveness. The purpose of this study was to examine 1) the level of
   uniformity in clinical practice models and faculty compensation plans
   for US dental school-based OMS departments and 2) the level of
   satisfaction expressed by faculty with their current compensation plan.
   Materials and Methods: A survey was sent to the chairs of the 40 US
   dental school-based OMS departments asking them specific information
   regarding their current practice model, the faculty compensation plan,
   and their satisfaction with their current plan.
   Results: Twenty-four of the 40 department chairs returned the survey,
   for a 60\% response rate. The OMS practice was part of the dental school
   faculty practice in 50\% of the departments and a separate entity in
   33\%. The most common faculty compensation plan consisted of an academic
   salary plus a faculty practice salary based on a collection-based
   incentive (38\%), but in 25\% it was based on production. Fifty-seven
   percent of the responding chairs stated they were not satisfied with
   their current practice and compensation plans.
   Conclusions: There is considerable variation in the practice models and
   compensation plans in US dental school-based OMS departments. More than
   half the department chairs expressed a general dissatisfaction with
   their current compensation plans. The survey data indicate a need for
   alternative models, and this report presents one such model. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Objectives: Evaluating unnecessary US medical practices, and the
   strategies that reduce them, are increasingly recognized as crucial to
   healthcare financing sustainability. Provider factors are known to
   affect unnecessary medical practices, yet little is known about how
   physician responses to patient requests for unnecessary care affect
   these practices. Among primary care physicians (PCPs), we investigated 2
   types of unnecessary medical practices triggered by patient requests: a)
   unnecessary specialty referrals and b) prescriptions for brand-name
   drugs when generic alternatives are available.
   Study Design: We used data from a survey of a nationally representative
   sample of 840 US PCPs in 2009. Response rates for family practice (n =
   274), internal medicine (n = 257), and pediatrics (n = 309) were 67.5\%,
   60.8\%, and 72.7\%, respectively.
   Results: In response to patient requests, 51.9\% of PCPs reported making
   unnecessary specialty referrals and 38.7\% prescribed brand-name drugs.
   Family physicians (odds ratio {[}OR], 2.77; 95\% CI, 1.77-4.34) and
   internal medicine physicians (OR, 4.51; 95\% CI, 2.87-7.06) were more
   likely than pediatricians to prescribe brandname drugs. PCP specialty
   was similarly associated with unnecessary referrals. Other predictors of
   acquiescence to patient requests included interactions with drug/ device
   representatives, more years of clinical experience, seeing fewer safety
   net patients, and solo/2-person practice organizations. Area-level
   Medicare spending was not associated with the 2 unnecessary practices.
   Conclusions: Many PCPs reported acquiescing to patient requests for
   unnecessary care. Provider and organizational factors predicted this
   behavior. Policies aimed at reducing such practice could improve care
   quality and lower cost. Patient and physician incentives that can
   potentially reduce unnecessary medical practices warrant exploration.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The adoption and use of health information technology (IT)
   continues to grow around the globe. In Switzerland, the government nor
   professional associations have to this day provided incentives for
   health IT adoption.
   Objective: We aim to assess the proportion of physicians who are
   routinely working with electronic health data and describe to what
   extent physicians exchange electronic health data with peers and other
   health care providers. Additionally, we aim to estimate the effect of
   physicians' attitude towards health IT on the adoption of electronic
   workflows.
   Methods: Between May and July 2013, we conducted a cross-sectional
   survey of 1200 practice based physicians in Switzerland. Respondents
   were asked to report on their technical means and where applicable their
   paper-based workarounds to process laboratory data, examination results,
   referral letters and physician's letters. Physicians' view of barriers
   and facilitators towards health IT use was determined by a composite
   score.
   Results: A response rate of 57.1\% (n = 685) was reached. The sample was
   considered to be representative for physicians in Swiss ambulatory care.
   35.2\% of the respondents documented patients' health status with the
   help of a longitudinal semi-structured electronic text record generated
   by one or more encounters in the practice. Depending on the task within
   a workflow, around 11-46\% of the respondents stated to rely on
   electronic workflow practices to process laboratory and examination data
   and dispatch referral notes and physician's letters. The permanent use
   of electronic workflow processes was infrequent. Instead, respondents
   reported paper-based workarounds affecting specific tasks within a
   workflow. Physicians' attitude towards health IT was significantly
   associated with the adoption of electronic workflows (OR 1.04-1.31, p <
   0.05), but the effect sizes of factors related to the working
   environment (e.g., regional factors, medical specialty, type of
   practice) were larger.
   Conclusion: At present, only a few physicians in Swiss ambulatory care
   routinely work with electronic health data. Until more of their peers
   participate in electronic exchange of structured clinical information,
   most physicians will continue to stay in paper-based systems and
   workarounds. The survey found that physicians with a positive attitude
   towards health IT were more likely to adopt electronic workflows, but
   the impact is minor. It will likely be necessary to introduce financial
   incentives and develop national standards in order to promote the
   adoption by a critical mass of practicing clinicians. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Background: The effect of timing of incentive payments on the response
   rate of telephone surveys is unknown. This study examined whether
   up-front or delayed incentive payments were associated with higher
   response rates for participation in a telephone interview administered
   longitudinal cohort study amongst primary care patients with lower
   urinary tract symptoms, and to compare the costs between the two timing
   methods.
   Methods: This study was conducted as part of a naturalistic observation
   study on the health-related quality of life and health outcomes of
   Chinese primary care patients with lower urinary tract symptoms. The
   incentive payment was in the form of a supermarket gift voucher to the
   value of HD\$50 (US\$6.50) and could be used in lieu of cash at a major
   supermarket chain. 720 subjects with lower urinary tract symptoms were
   randomly assigned into two groups. One group was offered an incentive of
   supermarket cash voucher at time of recruitment ('up-front' payment).
   The other group was told that the voucher would be sent to them after
   the complete of their 1-year follow-up telephone interview ('delayed'
   payment). Primary outcomes were the baseline and 1-year follow-up
   telephone survey response rates.
   Results: There was no statistical difference in response rates at
   baseline (p-value = 0.938) or at the 1-year follow-up (p-value = 0.751)
   between groups. Cost per completed subject interviews for the up-front
   payment method was USD16.64, whilst cost for the delayed payment was USD
   13.85.
   Conclusions: It appears the timing of incentive payments does not affect
   response rates for telephone interview surveys conducted on primary care
   patients in Hong Kong at baseline or at 1-year follow-up. Delayed
   incentive payments can reduce the overall cost per successful case.}},

Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Background: Health examination surveys (HESs), carried out in Europe
   since the 1950's, provide valuable information about the general
   population's health for health monitoring, policy making, and research.
   Survey participation rates, important for representativeness, have been
   falling. International comparisons are hampered by differing exclusion
   criteria and definitions for non-response.
   Method: Information was collected about seven national HESs in Europe
   conducted in 2007-2012. These surveys can be classified into household
   and individual-based surveys, depending on the sampling frames used.
   Participation rates of randomly selected adult samples were calculated
   for four survey modules using standardised definitions and compared by
   sex, age-group, geographical areas within countries, and over time,
   where possible.
   Results: All surveys covered residents not just citizens; three
   countries excluded those in institutions. In two surveys, physical
   examinations and blood sample collection were conducted at the
   participants' home; the others occurred at examination clinics.
   Recruitment processes varied considerably between surveys. Monetary
   incentives were used in four surveys. Initial participation rates aged
   35-64 were 45 \% in the Netherlands (phase II), 54 \% in Germany (new
   and previous participants combined), 55 \% in Italy, and 65 \% in
   Finland. In Ireland, England and Scotland, household participation rates
   were 66 \%, 66 \% and 63 \% respectively. Participation rates were
   generally higher in women and increased with age. Almost all
   participants attending an examination centre agreed to all modules but
   surveys conducted in the participants' home had falling responses to
   each stage. Participation rates in most primate cities were
   substantially lower than the national average. Age-standardized response
   rates to blood pressure measurement among those aged 35-64 in Finland,
   Germany and England fell by 0.7-1.5 percentage points p.a. between
   1998-2002 and 2010-2012. Longer trends in some countries show a more
   marked fall.
   Conclusions: The coverage of the general population in these seven
   national HESs was good, based on the sampling frames used and the sample
   sizes. Pre-notification and reminders were used effectively in those
   with highest participation rates. Participation rates varied by age,
   sex, geographical area, and survey design. They have fallen in most
   countries; the Netherlands data shows that they can be maintained at
   higher levels but at much higher cost.}},

Title = {{Knowledge and Perceptions of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI)
   among Poultry Traders in Live Bird Markets in Bali and Lombok, Indonesia}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) has been prevalent in Indonesia
   since 2003 causing major losses to poultry production and human deaths.
   Live bird markets are considered high risk areas due to the density of
   large numbers of mixed poultry species of unknown disease status.
   Understanding trader knowledge and perceptions of HPAI and biosecurity
   is critical to reducing transmission risk and controlling the disease.
   An interview-administered survey was conducted at 17 live bird markets
   on the islands of Bali and Lombok in 2008 and 2009. A total of 413 live
   poultry traders were interviewed. Respondents were mostly male (89\%)
   with a mean age of 45 years (range: 19-81). The main source of AI
   information was TV (78\%), although personal communication was also
   identified to be an important source, particularly among female traders
   (60\%) and respondents from Bali (43\%). More than half (58\%) of live
   poultry traders interviewed knew that infected birds can transmit HPAI
   viruses but were generally unaware that viruses can be introduced to
   markets by fomites. Cleaning cages and disposing of sick and dead birds
   were recognized as the most important steps to prevent the spread of
   disease by respondents. Two thirds (n = 277) of respondents were
   unwilling to report sudden or suspicious bird deaths to authorities.
   Bali vendors perceive biosecurity to be of higher importance than Lombok
   vendors and are more willing to improve biosecurity within markets than
   traders in Lombok. Collectors and traders selling large numbers (>214)
   of poultry, or selling both chickens and ducks, have better knowledge of
   HPAI transmission and prevention than vendors or traders selling smaller
   quantities or only one species of poultry. Education was strongly
   associated with better knowledge but did not influence positive
   reporting behavior. Our study reveals that most live poultry traders
   have limited knowledge of HPAI transmission and prevention and are
   generally reluctant to report bird deaths. Greater efforts are needed to
   engage local government, market managers and traders in education and
   awareness programs, regulatory measures and incentive mechanisms.
   Understanding and evaluating the social responses to such an integrated
   approach could lead to more effective HPAI prevention and control.}},

Journal = {{EDUCATIONAL REVIEW}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{67}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{483-504}},
Month = {{OCT 2}},
Abstract = {{The use of systems of rewards and sanctions within behaviour policies
   has now been adopted formally in UK schools. Such systems potentially
   represent competing theoretical ideas when considered alongside current
   approaches to teaching and learning. There is also opportunity for
   inconsistent use of rewards and sanctions resulting from the absence of
   a distinction between incentives and punishments and again between
   pupils' task-based work and their social behaviour. This case study
   comprises one of three questionnaire surveys completed by UK secondary
   school pupils in Year 7 and Year 11. The findings show a complex range
   of pupil responses to different behaviour management strategies, as well
   as highlighting changes in pupil responses across the age groups. Some
   sanctions for classroom behaviour are also found to lead pupils to stay
   quiet, potentially affecting their ability to engage in all learning
   activities. Sanctions such as asking pupils to miss break, or giving
   detentions, are seen to be counter-productive in encouraging pupils to
   work hard in class. Some rewards, such as the giving of ``stamps{''}
   work well in relation to how much pupils like the teacher, but they are
   not found to promote hard work in older pupils. The incentive of the
   school reward trip is universally effective, as is contact with home.
   These findings offer insight into the ways in which pupils respond to
   rewards and sanctions and therefore contribute to our understanding of
   how such systems might best be used.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{774-778}},
Month = {{OCT-NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: Patient satisfaction survey scores are increasingly being
   tied to incentive compensation, impact how we practice medicine,
   influence decisions on where patients seek care, and in the future may
   be required for accreditation. The goal of this study is to compare the
   results of an internal distribution of patient satisfaction surveys at
   the point of care to responses received by mail in a hospital-based,
   high-volume pediatric orthopaedic practice.
   Methods: A pediatric outpatient survey is used at our institution to
   evaluate patient satisfaction. Surveys are randomly mailed out to
   families seen in our clinic by the survey vendor, and the results are
   determined on a quarterly basis. We distributed the same survey in a
   similar manner in our clinic. The results of the surveys,
   external/mailed (EXM) versus internal/point of care (INP) over the same
   3-month time period (second quarter 2013) were compared. The survey
   questions are dichotomized from an ordinal scale into either excellent
   (9 to 10) or not excellent (0 to 8) commonly used in patient
   satisfaction methodology. We evaluated the raw data from the INP surveys
   for the question on provider rating by evaluating the mean score, the
   standard excellent response (9 to 10), and an expanded excellent
   response (8 to 10).
   Results: Response rate was 72/469 (15.4\%) for EXM, and 231/333 (69.4\%)
   for INP. An excellent response for the ``rating your provider{''}
   question was 72.2\% (EXM) versus 84.8\% (INP) (P= 0.015). Our analysis
   of the raw data (INP) has a mean rating of 9.42. The expanded scale (8
   to 10) for an excellent response increased the provider rating to 94.4\%
   (P= 0.001). Waiting time response within 15 minutes was the only item
   that correlated with rating of provider (P= 0.02). For the majority of
   the items, the INP responses were consistently higher than the EXM
   responses, including 6/7 responses that were statistically significant
   (P< 0.05).
   Conclusions: As mandated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
   Services, patient satisfaction surveys will be important in determining
   health care outcomes. Properly designed and administered surveys provide
   robust measures of quality. Our study reinforces methodological concerns
   about patient satisfaction surveys distributed in a high-volume
   pediatric subspecialty practice. Further research is needed to evaluate
   the patients' health care experience and true quality of care in
   pediatric subspecialty ambulatory settings.}},

Title = {{Survey of e-learning implementation and faculty support strategies in a
   cluster of mid-European medical schools}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{SEP 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: The use of electronic learning formats (e-learning) in
   medical education is reported mainly from individual specialty
   perspectives. In this study, we analyzed the implementation level of
   e-learning formats and the institutional support structures and
   strategies at an institutional level in a cluster of mid-European
   medical schools.
   Methods: A 49-item online questionnaire was send to 48 medical schools
   in Austria, Germany and Switzerland using SurveyMonkey (R). Data were
   collected between February and September of 2013 and analyzed using
   quantities, statistical and qualitative means.
   Results: The response rate was 71 \%. All schools had implemented
   e-learning, but mainly as an optional supplement to the curriculum.
   E-learning involved a wide range of formats across all disciplines.
   Online learning platforms were used by 97 \% of the schools. Full-time
   e-learning staff was employed by 50 \%, and these had a positive and
   significant effect on the presence of e-learning in the corresponding
   medical schools. In addition, 81 \% offered training programs and
   qualifications for their teachers and 76 \% awarded performance-oriented
   benefits, with 17 \% giving these for e-learning tasks. Realization of
   e-learning offers was rewarded by 33 \%, with 27 \% recognizing this as
   part of the teaching load. 97 \% would use curriculum-compatible
   e-learning tools produced by other faculties.
   Conclusions: While all participating medical schools used e-learning
   concepts, this survey revealed also a reasonable support by
   institutional infrastructure and the importance of staff for the
   implementation level of e-learning offerings. However, data showed some
   potential for increasing tangible incentives to motivate teachers to
   engage in further use of e-learning. Furthermore, the use of individual
   tools and the distribution of e-learning presentations in various
   disciplines were quite inhomogeneous. The willingness of the medical
   schools to cooperate should be capitalized for the future, especially
   concerning the provision of e-learning tools and concepts.}},

Abstract = {{We study how taxation influences labour supply using a specifically

   investigate whether taxes generally matter for the labour supply
   decisions of our respondents. Around 41 per cent report taking taxes
   into consideration, implying that the majority of the German population
   is unresponsive to taxation. Second, we look at self-reported labour
   supply adjustments following a recently enacted payroll tax change. Only
   around 12 per cent of our respondents report an actual labour supply
   response, but we find evidence of an income, as well as a substitution,
   effect of the tax change. Our conclusion is that the effects of taxes on
   labour supply in Germany are likely small. We analyse the correlation
   with economic and socio-demographic variables and find that the
   self-employed are relatively more sensitive to taxation and that low
   interest rates reduce incentives for expanding the labour supply. (C)

Abstract = {{Pension reforms in many developed countries make individuals shoulder a

   individuals accumulate private assets for retirement. Whether this

   reform have transformed the monolithic German pension system into a
   multipillar system. Formerly generous public pension benefits are
   gradually being reduced, whereas substantial incentives are granted to
   occupational and private saving schemes. Has this transition worked out?
   We survey the reform steps and households' reactions: How did
   individuals adjust their labor market behavior? How did private and
   occupational pension plans take off? How do behavioral adjustments vary
   in the population? Most Germans adapted to the new situation. Both
   actual and expected retirement decisions changed and the share of
   households without supplementary pensions decreased from 73\% to 39\% in
   little more than a decade. This is a remarkable success. Nonetheless,

Volume = {{47}},

Abstract = {{Human beings have used fire as an ecosystem management tool for
   thousands of years. In the context of the scientific and policy debate
   surrounding potential climate change adaptation and mitigation
   strategies, the importance of the impact of relatively recent state
   fire-exclusion policies on fire regimes has been debated. To provide
   empirical evidence to this ongoing debate we examine the impacts of
   state fire-exclusion policies in the chestnut forest ecosystems of two
   geographically neighbouring municipalities in central Spain, Casillas
   and Rozas de Puerto Real. Extending the concept of `Traditional
   Ecological Knowledge' to include the use of fire as a management tool as
   `Traditional Fire Knowledge' (TFK), we take a mixed-methods and
   interdisciplinary approach to argue that currently observed differences
   between the municipalities are useful for considering the
   characteristics of ``pre-industrial anthropogenic fire regimes{''} and
   their impact on chestnut forest ecosystems. We do this by examining how
   responses from interviews and questionnaire surveys of local inhabitants
   about TFK in the past and present correspond to the current biophysical
   landscape state and recent fire activity (based on data from
   dendrochronological analysis, aerial photography and official fire
   statistics). We then discuss the broader implications of TFK decline for
   future fire management policies across Europe particularly in light of
   the published results of the EU sponsored Fire Paradox research project.
   In locations where TFK-based ``pre-industrial anthropogenic fire
   regimes{''} still exist, ecosystem management strategies for adaptation
   and mitigation to climate change could be conceivably implemented at a
   minimal economic and political cost to the state by local communities
   that have both the TFK and the adequate social, economic and cultural
   incentives to use it. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In survey research, a consensus has grown regarding the effectiveness of

   paper is the first to present comprehensive information concerning the
   effects of incentives on response rates and nonresponse bias across
   large-scale surveys in Germany. The context could be viewed as a
   critical test for incentive effects because Germany's population is
   among the most survey-critical in the world, with very low response
   rates. Our results suggest positive incentive effects on response rates
   and patterns of effects that are similar to those in previous research:
   The effect increased with the monetary value of the incentive; cash
   incentives affected response propensity more strongly than lottery
   tickets do; and prepaid incentives could be more cost effective than
   conditional incentives. We found mixed results for the effects of
   incentives on nonresponse bias. Regarding large-scale panel surveys, we
   could not unequivocally confirm that incentives increased response rates

Abstract = {{Sustainable development in small island developing countries often
   hinges upon the successful adoption and diffusion of energy technologies
   developed abroad. To guide investments and policies seeking to promote
   new energy efficiency technologies academic and marketing studies often
   rely upon consumer self-reports of willingness to pay (WTP) for the
   environmental and economic benefits such technologies may provide. But
   marketing research has long reported disparities between consumer
   self-reports of willingness to pay and the actual amounts consumers will
   pay when making a purchase decision. This study uses the results of a
   survey and associated coupon distribution in Saint Lucia to contrast
   self-reported willingness to pay for energy-efficient compact
   fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) with actual consumer behavior in a
   developing country context. Survey responses suggested that more than
   94\% of urban consumers in Saint Lucia were willing to pay some price
   premium for a high quality CFL bulb. However, when given a coupon
   allowing them to purchase a CFL bulb at a price equal to or below their
   self-reported willingness to pay, only one-third of the consumers
   actually purchased the product. High income respondents, low income
   respondents, and younger respondents were among those most likely to not
   purchase a CFL bulb when offered the chance to do so at or below their
   self-reported willingness to pay. The presence of systematic
   discrepancies between self-reported willingness to pay and observed

Abstract = {{Background: Equitable access to health care is a goal subscribed to in
   many European economies. But while a growing body of literature studies
   socioeconomic inequalities in health service use, relatively little is
   still known about inequalities in medicine consumption. Against this
   background, this study investigates the (socioeconomic) determinants of
   medicine use in the Austrian context. Methods: Multivariate logistic
   regressions were estimated based on the European Health Interview
   Survey, including representative information of the Austrian population
   above age 25 (n = 13 291) for 2006/2007. As dependent variables, we used
   prescribed and non-prescribed medicine consumption as well as prescribed
   polypharmacy. Socioeconomic status was operationalized by employment
   status, education and net equivalent income. Health indicators
   (self-assessed health, chronic conditions), demographic characteristics
   (age, sex) and outpatient visits were included as control variables.
   Results: Socioeconomic status revealed opposing utilization patterns:
   while individuals with higher education and income were more likely to
   consume non-prescribed medicines, the less educated were more likely to
   take prescribed medicines. Lower socioeconomic groups also showed a
   higher likelihood for prescribed polypharmacy. For the consumption of
   both medicine types, the main socioeconomic determinant was high income.
   In an additional analysis, lower socioeconomic groups were found to more
   likely report prescription purposes as the main reason for consulting a
   practitioner. Conclusion: These results point to different behavioural
   responses to ill health, not least determined by institutional
   incentives in the Austrian health care system.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectivesTo inform demand management strategies aimed at reducing
   congestion in EDs by: (i) identifying public use of EDs, decision-making
   and reasons; and (ii) measuring acceptance of alternative care models.
   MethodsA cross-sectional telephone survey of a random sample of
   Queensland population aged 18 years or older residing in a dwelling unit
   in Queensland that could be contacted on a land-based telephone service
   was conducted. One person per household was selected according to a
   predetermined algorithm to ensure sex and regional balance were
   interviewed. The main outcome measures were: ED use, attitudes towards
   ED staff and services, and alternative models of care.
   ResultsThe final sample included a total of 1256 respondents (response
   rate = 40.3\%). Twenty-one per cent attended EDs in the preceding 12
   months. The decision to attend was made by patients (51\%), health and
   medical professionals (31\%), and others (18\%). The main reasons
   included perceived severity of the illness (47\%), unavailability of
   alternative services (26\%) and better care (11\%). Most respondents
   agreed with more flexible care models of service delivery including
   incentives for general practitioners (90\%), private health insurance
   coverage for ED use (89\%), and enhanced roles for paramedics and
   nurses.
   ConclusionsMain reason for attending ED is perceived severity of
   illness, followed by lack of alternative care. The majority of both
   consumers and the public are in favour of more flexible care models.
   However, further research is necessary to detail those alternatives and
   to test and validate their effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUNDPatient satisfaction has been associated with improved
   outcomes and become a focus of reimbursement.
   OBJECTIVEEvaluate an intervention to improve patient satisfaction.
   DESIGNNonrandomized, pre-post study that took place from 2011 to 2012.
   SETTINGLarge tertiary academic medical center.
   PARTICIPANTSInternal medicine (IM) resident physicians, non-IM resident
   physicians, and adult patients of the resident physicians.
   INTERVENTIONIM resident physicians were provided with patient
   satisfaction education through a conference, real-time individualized
   patient satisfaction score feedback, monthly recognition, and incentives
   for high patient-satisfaction scores.
   MAIN MEASURESPatient satisfaction on physician-related and overall
   satisfaction questions on the HCAHPS survey. We conducted a
   difference-in-differences regression analysis comparing IM and non-IM
   patient responses, adjusting for differences in patient characteristics.
   KEY RESULTSIn our regression analysis, the percentage of patients who
   responded positively to all 3 physician-related Hospital Consumer
   Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) questions
   increased by 8.1\% in the IM and 1.5\% in the control cohorts (absolute
   difference 6.6\%, P=0.04). The percentage of patients who would
   definitely recommend this hospital to friends and family increased by
   7.1\% in the IM and 1.5\% in the control cohorts (absolute difference
   5.6\%, P=0.02). The national average for the HCAHPS outcomes studied
   improved by no more than 3.1\%.
   LIMITATIONSThis study was nonrandomized and was conducted at a single
   site.
   CONCLUSIONTo our knowledge, this is the first intervention associated
   with a significant improvement in HCAHPS scores. This may serve as a
   model to increase patient satisfaction, hospital revenue, and train
   resident physicians. Journal of Hospital Medicine 2015;10:497-502. (c)

Journal = {{FOOD AND ENERGY SECURITY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation can save water while
   maintaining rice yields, but in some countries its adoption by farmers
   remains limited. Key knowledge gaps include the effect of AWD on early
   vegetative vigor and its relationship with yield; the effects of AWD on
   yield and water use efficiency of local cultivars used by smallholder
   farmers; and the socio-economic factors influencing current irrigation
   scheduling. To address these questions, an on-farm field trial of
   dry-season (chaite) rice, comparing two locally important cultivars
   (Hardinath-1 and CH-45) under AWD imposed from 1 week after
   transplanting to flowering and continuous flooding (CF), was carried out
   in Agyauli in the central Terai region of Nepal, and triangulated with
   social research methods exploring the rationale for current irrigation
   scheduling and perceptions of AWD. Although AWD plots received on
   average 57\% less irrigation water than CF plots, yields did not
   significantly differ between irrigation treatments, indicating that AWD
   could considerably enhance crop water use efficiency in this region. In
   the earlier flowering, more vigorous CH-45, there were no treatment
   differences in any yield component while in the later flowering
   Hardinath-1, an 11\% decrease in filled grain number was compensated by
   a 14\% increase in the percentage of effective tillers per hill.
   Although leaf elongation rate on the main tiller did not differ between
   treatments, tillering and green fraction (a measure of canopy closure)
   were significantly higher under AWD. Surveys established that most local
   farmers are already using a local adaptation of AWD to modify irrigation
   volumes, in some cases in response to a limited and unreliable water
   supply. However, farmers have few direct incentives to reduce overall
   water use under current water governance, and formal AWD practices are
   therefore unlikely to be adopted despite their viability as a
   water-saving irrigation technique.}},

Abstract = {{Cogeneration, also known as combined heat and power, is the simultaneous
   generation of electric and thermal energy from the same fuel source.
   Some proven benefits of cogeneration are much higher efficiencies than
   conventional power generation and its ability to facilitate distributed
   energy and lower energy costs. Also, when cogeneration is fueled with
   wood biomass, there are additional environmental benefits such as using
   a renewable energy source and lower greenhouse gas emissions. However,
   only a small number of wood product manufacturers (North American
   Industry Classification System codes 321 and 337) have adopted this
   technology. In this study, drivers, perceptions, and barriers for
   cogeneration were investigated to gain understanding of the reasons for
   the low adoption of this technology among wood product manufacturers.
   Interviews of experts and companies were conducted to identify and
   understand major topics of cogeneration adoption within the industry.
   Subsequently, a nonprobability, target survey of nonadopters was carried
   out to identify operational characteristics, perceptions about benefits
   of cogeneration, and bathers to its implementation. Findings show that
   economies of scale and coincidence between thermal and electric loads
   are some of the major factors for cogeneration feasibility. Main bathers
   identified were the initial investment and complexity, companies'
   return-on-investment requirements, utility tariff policies, and
   inadequate policies and incentives. Another major finding was a lack of
   awareness and knowledge about cogeneration, which presents organizations
   that support the forest products industry with an opportunity to provide
   education and outreach. However, because of the small sample size (52
   responses), generalization of these results to the population of
   interest is not feasible.}},

Abstract = {{This study utilizes an agent-based simulation model to conduct a public

   The simulation game tests the differences in sector responses to
   internal and external changes, including cross-sector spillovers, when

   innovation. The public policy strategies include clustering to develop
   certain industries, incentives to encourage cooperative research and
   development (R\&D), and spin-off policies to foster entrepreneurship
   among R\&D personnel. These policies are compared to a `no-policy'
   alternative, which serves as a benchmark to verify the gains (or loses)
   in the number of firms cooperating and networking. The simulation model
   defines firms' behavior according to empirical findings from an analysis
   of determinants of the firms' participation in cooperation in innovation
   with other organizations using a Korean Innovation Survey. The exercise
   indicates possible appropriate policy strategies that can be applied
   depending on the target industries. We have applied a few examples and
   showed how the results may be interpreted. Agent-based models are found

Abstract = {{The population of the Critically Endangered Mariana crow Corvus kubaryi
   on the island of Rota, Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands,
   has decreased dramatically in recent years. It is unclear to what extent
   negative practices by people, such as inappropriate land use or
   persecution of crows, have contributed to this decline. We conducted a
   public opinion survey to document ongoing practices towards the crows on
   Rota, to assess residents' knowledge of and attitudes towards the birds,
   and to gauge potential responses to a government-instituted land
   incentive programme. Enumerators administered surveys in person during
   August 2011. Most of the 573 respondents were native Chamorro residents
   (75\%) and more than half were landowners (62\%). A majority of
   respondents (72\%) considered environmental issues very important' and
   76\% knew of the Mariana crow's Critically Endangered status. Fewer
   respondents (55\%) expressed concern about the bird going extinct. A
   number of respondents condoned shooting and chasing crows (17 and 52\%,
   respectively), suggesting that residents may be harassing the birds.
   Chamorro landowners on the island were more likely to have negative
   attitudes towards the crows and to know people who persecute the crows
   than other island residents. Education was positively correlated with
   knowledge and concern about the crow and environmental issues,
   suggesting that new educational programmes on Rota may help improve
   residents' attitudes towards the species. In addition, we recommend a
   revision of current land-use regulations and implementation of a
   monetary compensation programme for owners of crow nesting habitat to
   improve landowners' attitudes and practices.}},

Title = {{Homeowners, renters and the political economy of property taxation}},
Journal = {{REGIONAL SCIENCE AND URBAN ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{53}},
Pages = {{38-49}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Studies find that renters are more supportive of public spending that is
   financed by the property tax than homeowners, a finding commonly
   referred to as the ``renter effect.{''} The renter effect suggests that,
   all else equal, renters should prefer property taxation over other forms
   of taxation. We test that hypothesis using detailed. micro-level survey
   data that contains voter responses to two key questions: their
   willingness to pay higher property taxes to fund public services and
   their willingness to pay higher sales taxes to fund those services.
   Using a difference-in-differences estimation strategy, we find first
   that renters are approximately 10 to 18 percentage points more likely
   than homeowners to favor a property tax increase over a sales tax
   increase, a finding consistent with the presence of a renter effect.
   However, these results are not driven by the survey responses of
   renters. Analysis based on separate regressions for renters and
   homeowners reveals that renters are indifferent between a property tax
   increase and either a sales tax or state income tax increase, while
   homeowners strongly oppose a property tax increase relative to either a
   sales tax or state income tax increase. Further, the strong opposition
   among homeowners to the property tax is not eroded by including controls
   for income and other demographics as might be expected if these
   differences were driven by economic incentives. Finally, an examination
   of the variation in tax burden created by Proposition 13 in California
   shows no evidence that homeowner aversion to the property tax increases
   with the homeowner's relative tax burden. These findings of homeowner
   aversion to property taxes are consistent with recent work suggesting
   that salience matters when voters evaluate taxes, but also suggest that
   increased salience does not necessarily lead to more careful
   consideration of individual tax burdens. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Background: The current state of employment satisfaction in plastic

   residents as they search for employment and the role of attending
   surgeons as mentors in this process have not been elicited. The authors
   aim to elucidate these measures through a survey of attending surgeons
   and senior residents.
   Methods: A survey was created assessing employment satisfaction and was
   distributed to members of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons with
   available contact information. Responses were analyzed, with values of p
   < 0.05 deemed significant.
   Results: A total of 616 plastic surgeons and senior plastic surgery
   residents responded. Compared with attending surgeons in private
   practice, those in academic practice were more satisfied with their case
   mix (p = 0.0005; OR, not significant) and less satisfied with their
   incentive structure (p = 0.0001; OR, 0.3155) and payor mix (p = 0.0005;
   OR, 0.6156). Employment change occurred in 225 surgeons (39.2 percent)
   since beginning practice. Surgeons that changed employment ranked base
   salary (p = 0.0031), earning potential (p = 0.0001), and incentive
   structure (p = 0.0001) as most important. Those that did not change
   employment ranked lifestyle (p = 0.0048), location (p = 0.0001), and
   desire to teach (p = 0.0002) as more important. Residents ranked
   location (p = 0.0030), desired case mix (p = 0.0131), and desire or lack
   of desire to teach residents (p = 0.0329) as more important than
   attending surgeons felt they should be, and guaranteed salary (p =
   0.0178) and incentive structure (p = 0.0069) as less important.
   Conclusions: In an evolving health care environment, plastic surgeons'
   employment satisfaction is significantly dependent on a myriad of

Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{21-37}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Cities can be characterized by extensive sealing limiting the supply of
   ecosystem services. In Europe, soil sealing is still increasing despite
   decreasing population. This paper shows that the management of urban
   soil sealing must due to its complex driving forces, impacts,
   constraints of its management and different actors be considered as a
   wicked problem. By using the method of response-efficiency-assessment
   (REA), the strategies ``legal-planning{''}, ``informal-planning{''},
   ``economic-fiscal{''}, ``co-operative{''} and ``informational{''} are
   assessed in their degree of efficiency as being ecologically
   sustainable, economically functional, institutionally accepted,
   supporting environmental competence and living quality. Responses were
   assessed by indicators using a content analysis and survey of urban
   actors and residents in Leipzig and Munich (Germany). Main results of
   the study show that no single strategy can provide an efficient solution
   for reducing soil sealing but rather a mix of clumsy solutions are
   necessary promoting: (I) stricter regulations and an increase in
   ecological-financial incentives, (2) stronger commitment by urban actors
   toward sealing reduction supported by informal-planning responses and
   scientific know-how, (3) information addressed to urban residents
   supporting self-reflection on impacts of private land consumption and
   (4) improved horizontal and regional co-operations taking into account
   cities' responsibility for urban and global sustainability. This study
   provides a valuable approach on how to puzzle together clumsy solutions
   on the example of soil sealing management as a challenge in an urbanized
   world. This method can also be used for other current wicked problems

Abstract = {{Background: Survey response rates among physicians are declining, and

   survey completion rate, (3) time to response, and (4) time spent

   Methods: A total of 1850 US intensivists from an existing database were
   randomized to receive a survey invitation email with or without an
   Amazon.com incentive available to the first 100 respondents. The
   incentive could be instantly redeemed for an amount chosen by the
   respondent, up to a maximum of US \$50.
   Results: The overall response rate was 35.90\% (630/1755). Among the
   35.4\% (111/314) of eligible participants choosing the incentive, 80.2\%
   (89/111) selected the maximum value. Among intensivists offered an
   incentive, the response was 6.0\% higher (95\% CI 1.5-10.5, P=.01),
   survey completion was marginally greater (807/859, 94.0\% vs 892/991,

Abstract = {{Prepaid survey incentives are an attractive tool for attempting to

   concern that the use of incentives may bring less motivated respondents

   whether a prepaid cash incentive in a telephone survey affected the
   prevalence of 11 indicators of response quality by comparing the answers
   of respondents who received a \$5 incentive with those of respondents
   who did not receive one. Significant differences between the incentive
   and control groups are observed for only two of these 11 indicators; the
   respondents who received the incentive had less item nonresponse but
   spent less time per question. We find some evidence that these effects
   may be limited to the second half of the questionnaire. We also assess
   whether the effect of the incentive varied according to respondent
   characteristics, such as age, educational attainment, and household
   income, finding minimal evidence that this was the case. Overall, these

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Among children's hospitals, little is known
   about how barriers to electronic health record (EHR) adoption are
   related to meaningful use (MU) incentives. We investigated hospital
   success with MU incentive payments and determined associations with
   hospital-reported challenges and characteristics.
   METHODS: A survey administered to 224 Children's Hospital Association
   hospitals assessed a variety of potential challenges to achieving
   meaningful EHR use (eg, lack of access to capital) and specific MU
   criteria that would be challenging to fulfill (eg, implement clinical
   decision support rules). These results were combined with data on
   hospitals that received MU payments up to March 2014 and information on
   hospital characteristics. Associations between anticipated challenges,
   children's hospital type, and receipt of MU incentives were evaluated in
   bivariate and multivariate analyses.
   RESULTS: One hundred thirty-three children hospitals completed the
   survey (response rate 59.4\%). Thirty-five percent of responding
   children's hospitals received MU incentive payments. The most frequently
   anticipated hospital challenges included the following: exchange
   clinical information with other providers outside your hospital system
   (49\%), and generate numerator and denominator data for quality
   reporting directly from EHR (41\%). Freestanding children's hospitals
   were more likely to indicate lack of relevance of MU criteria to
   pediatric care (odds ratio: 37.6 {[}95\% confidence interval:
   4.6-309.3]) and more likely to receive MU incentive payments (odds
   ratio: 26 {[}95\% confidence interval: 5.2-130.6]).
   CONCLUSIONS: As of 2014, a minority of children's hospitals have
   successfully received MU incentive payments. Freestanding children's
   hospitals are more likely to report MU is not relevant to pediatric care
   and to succeed with MU incentive payments.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To compare the impact of unconditional and conditional
   financial incentives on response rates among Australian general
   practitioners invited by mail to participate in an online survey about
   cancer care and to investigate possible differential response bias
   between incentive groups.
   Study Design and Setting: Australian general practitioners were randomly
   allocated to unconditional incentive (book voucher mailed with letter of
   invitation), conditional incentive (book voucher mailed on completion of
   the online survey), or control (no incentive). Nonresponders were asked
   to complete a small subset of questions from the online survey.
   Results: Among 3,334 eligible general practitioners, significantly
   higher response rates were achieved in the unconditional group (167 of
   1,101, 15\%) compared with the conditional group (118 of 1,111, 11\%) (P
   = 0.0014), and both were significantly higher than the control group (74
   of 1,122, 7\%; both P < 0.001). Although more positive opinions about
   cancer care were expressed by online responders compared with
   nonresponders, there was no evidence that the magnitude of difference
   varied by the incentive group. The incremental cost for each additional
   1\% increase above the control group response rate was substantially
   higher for the unconditional incentive group compared with the
   conditional incentive group.
   Conclusion: Both unconditional and conditional financial incentives
   significantly increased response with no evidence of differential
   response bias. Although unconditional incentives had the largest effect,
   the conditional approach was more cost-effective. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {{Working Under a Clinic-Level Quality Incentive: Primary Care Clinicians'

Volume = {{13}},

Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND A key consideration in designing pay-for-performance programs
   is determining what entity the incentive should be awarded to-individual
   clinicians or to groups of clinicians working in teams. Some argue that
   team-level incentives, in which clinicians who are part of a team
   receive the same incentive based on the team's performance, are most
   effective; others argue for the efficacy of clinician-level incentives.
   This study examines primary care clinicians' perceptions of a team-based
   quality incentive awarded at the clinic level.
   METHODS This research was conducted with Fairview Health Services, where
   40\% of the primary care compensation model was based on clinic-level
   quality performance. We conducted 48 in-depth interviews to explore
   clinicians' perceptions of the clinic-level incentive, as well as an
   online survey of 150 clinicians (response rate 56\%) to investigate
   which entity the clinicians would consider optimal to target for quality
   incentives.
   RESULTS Clinicians reported the strengths of the clinic-based quality
   incentive were quality improvement for the team and less patient
   ``dumping,{''} or shifting patients with poor outcomes to other
   clinicians. The weaknesses were clinicians' lack of control and
   colleagues riding the coattails of higher performers. There were mixed
   reports on the model's impact on team dynamics. Although clinicians
   reported greater interaction with colleagues, some described an increase
   in tension. Most clinicians surveyed (73\%) believed that there should
   be a mix of clinic and individual-level incentives to maintain
   collaboration and recognize individual performance.
   CONCLUSION The study highlights the important advantages and
   disadvantages of using incentives based upon clinic-level performance.
   Future research should test whether hybrid incentives that mix group and
   individual incentives can maintain some of the best elements of each
   design while mitigating the negative impacts.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE Health information technology (IT) offers promising tools for
   improving care coordination. We assessed the feasibility and
   acceptability of 6 proposed care coordination objectives for stage 3 of
   the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services electronic health record
   incentive program (Meaningful Use) related to referrals, notification of
   care from other facilities, patient clinical summaries, and patient
   dashboards.
   METHODS We surveyed physician-owned and hospital/health
   system-affiliated primary care practices that achieved patient-centered
   medical home recognition and participated in the Meaningful Use program,
   and community health clinics with patient-centered medical home
   recognition (most with certified electronic health record systems). The
   response rate was 35.1\%. We ascertained whether practices had
   implemented proposed objectives and perceptions of their importance. We
   analyzed the association of organizational and contextual factors with
   self-reported use of health IT to support care coordination activities.
   RESULTS Although 78\% of the 350 respondents viewed timely notification
   of hospital discharges as very important, only 48.7\% used health IT
   systems to accomplish this task. The activity most frequently supported
   by health IT was providing clinical summaries to patients, in 76.6\% of
   practices; however, merely 47.7\% considered this activity very
   important. Greater use of health IT to support care coordination
   activities was positively associated with the presence of a nonclinician
   responsible for care coordination and the practice's capacity for
   systematic change.
   CONCLUSIONS Even among practices having a strong commitment to the
   medical home model, the use of health IT to support care coordination
   objectives is not consistent. Health IT capabilities are not currently
   aligned with clinicians' priorities. Many practices will need financial
   and technical assistance for health IT to enhance care coordination.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Submission of clinical quality measures (CQMs) data are 1 of
   3 major requirements for providers to receive meaningful use (MU)
   incentive payments under the 2009 Health Information Technology for
   Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act. Some argue that CQMs are the
   most important component of MU. Developing an evidence base for how
   practices can successfully use electronic health records (EHRs) to
   achieve improvement in CQMs is essential and may benefit from the study
   of exemplars who have successfully implemented EHRs and demonstrated
   high performance on CQMs.
   Methods: Conducted in PPRNet, a national primary care practice-based
   research network, this study used a multimethod approach combining an
   EHR-based CQM performance assessment, a provider survey, and focus
   groups among high CQM performers. Practices whose providers had attested
   for stage 1 MU were eligible for the study. Performance on 21 CQMs
   included in the 2014 MU CQM set and a summary measure was assessed as of
   October 1, 2013, through an automated data extract and standard analytic
   procedures. A web-based provider survey, conducted in November to
   December 2013, assessed provider agreement, staff education, use of EHR
   reminders, standing orders, and EHR-based patient education related to
   the 21 CQMs. The survey also had more general questions about the
   practices' use of EHR functionality and quality improvement (QI)
   strategies. Statistical analyses using general linear mixed models
   assessed the associations between responses to the survey and CQM
   performance, adjusted for several practice covariates. Three focus
   groups, held in early 2014, provided an opportunity for clinicians to
   provide their perspectives on the validity of the statistical analyses
   and to provide context-specific examples from their practice that
   supported their assessment.
   Results: Seventy-one practices completed the study, and 319 (92.1\%) of
   their providers completed the survey. There was wide variability in
   performance on the 21 CQMs among the practices. Mean performance ranged
   from 89.8\% for tobacco use screening and counseling to 12.9\% for
   chlamydia screening. In bivariate analyses, more positive associations
   were found between CQM performance and staff education, use of standing
   orders, and EHR reminders than for provider agreement or EHR-based
   patient education. In multivariate analyses, EHR reminders were most
   frequently associated with individual CQM performance; several EHR,
   practice QI, and administrative variables were associated with the
   summary quality measure.
   Conclusions: Purposeful use of EHR functionality coupled with staff
   education in a milieu where QI is valued and supported is associated
   with higher performance on CQM.}},

Abstract = {{Although there are a number of social networking services that

   services (ASNSs). To fill this gap, we explore the populations of

   of further engagement, we also determine their various motivations for
   joining a group in ASNSs. Using groups and their members in Mendeley as
   the platform for our case study, we obtained 146 participant responses
   from our online survey about users' common activities, usage habits, and
   motivations for joining groups. Our results show that (a) participants
   did not engage with social-based features as frequently and actively as
   they engaged with research-based features, and (b) users who joined more
   groups seemed to have a stronger motivation to increase their
   professional visibility and to contribute the research articles that
   they had read to the group reading list. Our results generate
   interesting insights into Mendeley's user populations, their activities,
   and their motivations relative to the social features of Mendeley. We

Abstract = {{ObjectiveThe Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) are a vital data
   resource for cross-country comparative analyses. This study is part of a
   set of analyses assessing the types of providers being used for
   reproductive and maternal health care across 57 countries. Here, we
   examine some of the challenges encountered using DHS data for this
   purpose, present the provider classification we used, and provide
   recommendations to enable more detailed and accurate cross-country
   comparisons of healthcare provision.
   MethodsWe used the most recent DHS surveys between 2000 and 2012; 57
   countries had data on family planning and delivery care providers and 47
   countries had data on antenatal care. Every possible response option
   across the 57 countries was listed and categorised. We then developed a
   classification to group provider response options according to two key
   dimensions: clinical nature and profit motive.
   ResultsWe classified the different types of maternal and reproductive
   healthcare providers, and the individuals providing care. Documented
   challenges encountered during this process were limitations inherent in
   household survey data based on respondents' self-report; conflation of
   response options in the questionnaire or at the data processing stage;
   category errors of the place vs. professional for delivery; inability to
   determine whether care received at home is from the public or private
   sector; a large number of negligible response options; inconsistencies
   in coding and analysis of data sets; and the use of inconsistent
   headings.
   ConclusionsTo improve clarity, we recommend addressing issues such as
   conflation of response options, data on public vs. private provider,
   inconsistent coding and obtaining metadata. More systematic and
   standardised collection of data would aid international comparisons of
   progress towards improved financial protection, and allow us to better
   characterise the incentives and commercial nature of different
   providers.}},

Title = {{Exploring physician specialist response rates to web-based surveys}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{APR 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Survey research in healthcare is an important tool to
   collect information about healthcare delivery, service use and overall
   issues relating to quality of care. Unfortunately, physicians are often
   a group with low survey response rates and little research has looked at
   response rates among physician specialists. For these reasons, the
   purpose of this project was to explore survey response rates among
   physician specialists in a large metropolitan Canadian city.
   Methods: As part of a larger project to look at physician payment plans,
   an online survey about medical billing practices was distributed to 904
   physicians from various medical specialties. The primary method for
   physicians to complete the survey was via the Internet using a
   well-known and established survey company (www.surveymonkey.com).
   Multiple methods were used to encourage survey response such as
   individual personalized email invitations, multiple reminders, and a
   draw for three gift certificate prizes were used to increase response
   rate. Descriptive statistics were used to assess response rates and
   reasons for non-response.
   Results: Overall survey response rate was 35.0\%. Response rates varied
   by specialty: Neurology/neurosurgery (46.6\%); internal medicine
   (42.9\%); general surgery (29.6\%); pediatrics (29.2\%); and psychiatry
   (27.1\%). Non-respondents listed lack of time/survey burden as the main
   reason for not responding to our survey.
   Conclusions: Our survey results provide a look into the challenges of
   collecting healthcare research where response rates to surveys are often
   low. The findings presented here should help researchers in planning
   future survey based studies. Findings from this study and others suggest
   smaller monetary incentives for each individual may be a more
   appropriate way to increase response rates.}},

Month = {{APR 2}},
Abstract = {{This paper identifies trends within and relationships between the amount
   of participation and the quality of contributions in three crowdsourced
   surveys. Participants were asked to perform a collective problem solving
   task that lacked any explicit incentive: they were instructed not only
   to respond to survey questions but also to pose new questions that they
   thought might-if responded to by others-predict an outcome variable of
   interest to them. While the three surveys had very different outcome
   variables, target audiences, methods of advertisement, and lengths of
   deployment, we found very similar patterns of collective behavior. In
   particular, we found that: the rate at which participants submitted new
   survey questions followed a heavy-tailed distribution; the distribution
   in the types of questions posed was similar; and many users posed
   non-obvious yet predictive questions. By analyzing responses to
   questions that contained a built-in range of valid response we found
   that less than 0.2\% of responses lay outside of those ranges,
   indicating that most participants tend to respond honestly to surveys of
   this form, even without explicit incentives for honesty. While we did
   not find a significant relationship between the quantity of
   participation and the quality of contribution for both response
   submissions and question submissions, we did find several other more
   nuanced participant behavior patterns, which did correlate with
   contribution in one of the three surveys. We conclude that there exists
   an optimal time for users to pose questions early on in their
   participation, but only after they have submitted a few responses to
   other questions. This suggests that future crowdsourced surveys may
   attract more predictive questions by prompting users to pose new
   questions at specific times during their participation and limiting
   question submission at non-optimal times.}},

Abstract = {{With the advent of sustainable building ordinances in the USA and
   internationally, contractors are increasingly required to deliver
   sustainable projects; however, they have traditionally not been
   considered partners in developing the sustainability goals and
   objectives for projects. Moreover, as alternative project delivery
   methods become more popular, contractors have an opportunity and - in an
   increasing number of cases - a requirement, to take a larger role in
   sustainability efforts across the building life cycle. Understanding the
   contractor's self-perceived role, in addition to their incentives for
   participation, in the sustainable construction industry is imperative to
   providing insight into their future role within the industry. This paper
   presents data from and analysis of a survey of US-based general
   contractors. The survey asked general contractors for their opinions and
   viewpoints regarding sustainable construction; respondents provided
   feedback about corporate profitability, growth forecast and specific
   obstacles to sustainable building. The authors present a potential path
   from the current state of sustainable construction industry in the USA
   to a projected future state (both characterised by the survey
   responses). Finally, factors that will affect the transition to the

Journal = {{FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS}},

Volume = {{53}},
Pages = {{45-55}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Performance of harvesting operations is vital for wood supply chains to
   enable delivery of the right product to the right market at the right
   price. Consequently, the performance of harvesting contractors has been
   the topic of many studies over the years, but few of these have
   investigated the critical issue of whether contractor performance is in
   alignment with downstream needs. Furthermore, no previous study has
   suggested a clear route that forest companies can take to promote
   alignment of their employed contractors. This paper presents a framework
   specifically designed to help managers measure and foster contractor
   alignment within their wood supply chain.
   The framework was tested on a large sample of harvesting contractors
   operating in Sweden, for which a performance survey and a statistical
   procedure was utilized to segment contractors into groups of varying
   levels of alignment with their customer company. Results from the test
   were then used to suggest to the customer's managers the most viable
   blend of four generic alignment approaches for each contractor group:
   active sourcing, adapted incentives, active use of power advantage, and
   tailored contractor development programmes. If implemented, such a
   structured but differentiated approach to contractor alignment should
   lead to the most beneficial response from each contractor, and
   eventually to improved performance of the wood supply chain.
   Consequently, forest companies need to use, and be proficient in the use
   of, a variety of approaches to contractor alignment to make the most of
   their contractor force. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background Police crash reports have been used to advance motor vehicle
   safety research, though their value is limited by their focus on the
   crash event rather than outcomes of the crash.
   Objective To develop and evaluate the effect of enhanced recruitment
   methods, including a monetary incentive, on response rates of drivers
   identified on police reports in a national MVC surveillance system.
   Methods The National Automotive Sampling System-General Estimates System
   (NASS-GES) was used to identify passenger vehicle crashes between 1 July
   and 30 October 2012 involving drivers >= 16 years old with at least one
   child occupant <= 17 years old. We collected data from the driver via
   self-administered hardcopy or interviewer-administered telephone
   surveys. Within each survey mode, half the drivers were randomly
   assigned to receive a small monetary incentive. Response rates were
   calculated overall, and by mode of survey administration and incentive
   condition.
   Results 495 drivers were eligible, and 127 completed the survey,
   yielding an overall response rate of 25.7\% (95\% CI 21.8\% to 29.5\%).
   The response rate across the two modes was higher for those who received
   an incentive than for those who did not (35.6\% vs 15.7\%, p<0.01). The
   highest response rate (45.9\%) was for drivers allocated to the
   telephone survey who received an incentive.
   Conclusions The NASS-GES provides a surveillance system from which cases
   of interest can be identified and supplemental data collected via
   surveys of drivers identified on police reports. We adapted procedures
   commonly used in public health surveillance systems, including monetary
   incentives and branded recruitment materials, to improve driver response
   rates.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation development (CD) refers to a set of land development
   techniques aimed at minimizing impacts on natural resources. Typically,
   homes are clustered and open space is set aside for conservation. The
   evidence for the effectiveness of CDs in conserving biodiversity is
   mixed, with some studies attributing these results to a lack of
   stewardship in conserved areas. The purpose of this research was to ask
   landowners and developers to evaluate which conservation practices, as
   part of a policy scenario, would be most acceptable. We surveyed
   landowners and developers who had created CDs in north-central Colorado;
   we solicited their attitudes about native wildlife conservation and
   willingness to adopt four conservation practices, given proposed
   incentive-based policies. We also conducted semi-structured interviews
   with respondents to elaborate on their response to these proposed
   incentives, as well as two potential funding mechanisms for managing the
   open space for biodiversity (homeowners' association dues and a property
   tax). Overall, we found moderate support for the conservation practices,
   some interest in two types of incentives (a housing density bonus and
   fast-tracking permits), and opposition to the two proposed funding
   mechanisms for land stewardship. Our findings suggest that CD developers
   in Colorado would be willing to adopt conservation practices, and are
   generally supportive of incentive-based policies, but greater
   understanding of homeowners' willingness to pay for conservation
   features is needed to gain support for a funding mechanism. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{This meta-analysis quantifies the dose-response relationship between

   data-collection modes (mail, telephone, and in-person) under the same
   analytic framework. Using hierarchical regression modeling and
   literature from the past 21 years, the analysis finds a strong,
   nonlinear effect of incentives. Survey mode and incentive delivery
   timing (prepaid or promised) also play important roles in the
   effectiveness of incentives. Prepaid incentives offered in mail surveys
   had the largest per-dollar impact on response. Incentive timing appears
   to play an important role in the effectiveness of incentives offered in
   telephone surveys but not in-person surveys. Our model estimates a null
   effect of promised incentives in mail surveys; however, given the dearth
   of experiments testing this type of incentive, we are unable to draw
   firm conclusions regarding their effectiveness. Survey burden and survey
   year both were negatively correlated with response overall. However,
   neither significantly impacted the dose-response relationship. Survey
   sponsorship affected neither response rate nor incentive effectiveness.
   The development and results of the model are discussed, and

Journal = {{SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{328-342}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This research addresses gender differences in environmental protection
   efforts. Recent work indicates that, across a variety of domains, women
   are more generous, charitable, and prosocial than men. Despite
   above-average levels of these motivators for cooperation, considerable
   experimental research points to no difference in cooperation between
   genders. What can explain women's lower-than-expected cooperation
   levels? Prior research indicates that, compared to men, women are less
   trusting and respond to fear incentives in social dilemmas - they are
   concerned about being exploited. We test these arguments in the context
   of environmental behaviors and argue that lower trust and greater
   responses to fear incentives mean that women's cooperation is predicated
   on trust. For men, trust does not predict environmental cooperation. The
   current research represents the first empirical test of these arguments.
   Using data from the General Social Survey we focus on private sphere
   behaviors and political participation and predict an interaction between
   gender and trust on cooperation. Results support this prediction. (C)

Title = {{An international cross-sectional survey on the Quality and Costs of
   Primary Care (QUALICO-PC): recruitment and data collection of places
   delivering primary care across Canada}},
Journal = {{BMC FAMILY PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{FEB 18}},
Abstract = {{Background: Performance reporting in primary health care in Canada is
   challenging because of the dearth of concise and synthesized
   information. The paucity of information occurs, in part, because the
   majority of primary health care in Canada is delivered through a
   multitude of privately owned small businesses with no mechanism or
   incentives to provide information about their performance. The purpose
   of this paper is to report the methods used to recruit family physicians
   and their patients across 10 provinces to provide self-reported
   information about primary care and how this information could be used in
   recruitment and data collection for future large scale pan-Canadian and
   other cross-country studies.
   Methods: Canada participated in an international large scale study-the
   QUALICO-PC (Quality and Costs of Primary Care) study. A set of four
   surveys, designed to collect in-depth information regarding primary care
   activities was collected from: practices, providers, and patients
   (experiences and values). Invitations (telephone, electronic or mailed)
   were sent to family physicians. Eligible participants were sent a
   package of surveys. Provincial teams kept records on the number of:
   invitation emails/letters sent, physicians who registered, practices
   that were sent surveys, and practices returning completed surveys.
   Response and cooperation rates were calculated.
   Results: Invitations to participate were sent to approximately 23,000
   family physicians across Canada. A total of 792 physicians and 8,332
   patients from 772 primary care practices completed the surveys,
   including 1,160 participants completing a Patient Values survey and
   7,172 participants completing a Patient Experience survey. Overall, the
   response rate was very low ranging from 2\% (British Columbia) to 21\%
   (Nova Scotia). However, the participation rate was high, ranging from
   72\% (Ontario) to 100\% (New Brunswick/Prince Edward Island and
   Newfoundland \& Labrador).
   Conclusions: The difficulties obtaining acceptable response rates by
   family physicians for survey participation is a universal challenge.
   This response rate for the QUALICO-PC arm in Canada was similar to rates
   found in other countries such as Australia and New Zealand. Even though
   most family physicians operate as self-employed small businesses, they
   could be supported to routinely submit data through a collective effort
   and provincial mandate. The groundwork in setting up pan-Canadian
   collaboration in primary care has been established through this study.}},

Journal = {{SWISS MEDICAL WEEKLY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{145}},
Month = {{FEB 9}},
Abstract = {{QUESTIONS UNDER STUDY: The reimbursement system SwissDRG sets incentives
   for hospitals and providers to treat patients in a cost-efficient way.
   Arising conflicts between the commitment to the patient's well-being and
   the economic interests of the hospital can lead to an impairment of
   quality and equity of health care. We developed and used a monitoring
   tool to evaluate ethically relevant aspects related to DRGs by surveying
   physicians.
   METHODS: We surveyed a random sample of physicians working in Swiss
   hospitals, exploring potentially positive and negative effects of DRGs
   on patient care.
   RESULTS: A total of 382 physicians completed the questionnaire (response
   rate 47\%). More than 90\% judged quality of health care ``very good{''}
   or ``rather good{''}, and 83\% were satisfied with their job. The
   majority of physicians gave more consideration to economic issues in
   their clinical practise than they would have liked and had experienced
   various forms of over-and under-provision over the past six months.
   Overall, physicians considered patient-orientation deteriorating since
   the introduction of DRGs with no gains in efficiency. Professional
   principles could not be applied in all instances.
   CONCLUSIONS: Two years after the introduction of SwissDRG the quality of
   patient care and the job satisfaction is rated as good by most
   physicians. However, quality of care could be seriously compromised if
   more economic pressure is put on physicians in the future. Careful
   monitoring is needed to ensure that the needed focus on cost-containment
   and sustainability does not come at the expense of the high performance
   of the Swiss health care system.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, parastatal grain marketing boards have re-emerged as
   important elements of grain markets in eastern and southern Africa, yet
   little is known about how farmers are responding to their scaled up
   activities. This article develops a conceptual model of farmers'
   production decisions in the context of dual output marketing channels
   (government and private sector) when output prices at harvest time and
   the availability of one of the marketing channels are unknown at
   planting time. It then applies the model to the case of Zambia and uses
   nationally representative household-level panel survey data to estimate
   the effects of the Food Reserve Agency (FRA), the government parastatal
   maize marketing board, on smallholder crop production and fallow land.
   The FRA buys maize from smallholders at a pan-territorial price that
   typically exceeds market prices in major maize producing areas. Results
   suggest that increases in the farmgate FRA maize price raise farmer
   maize price expectations, which induces a supply response. Smallholders
   respond to an increase in the FRA price by extensifying their maize
   production. On average, a 1\% increase in the FRA price is associated
   with 0.06\% increases in smallholders' maize area planted and quantity
   harvested. There is also some evidence that farmers reduce the area of
   land under fallow in response to FRA incentives but there is no evidence
   of reductions in the area planted to other crops.}},

Title = {{Maximising response from GPs to questionnaire surveys: do length or
   incentives make a difference?}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{JAN 6}},
Abstract = {{Background: General Practitioners (GPs) respond poorly to postal
   surveys. Consequently there is potential for reduced data quality and
   bias in the findings. In general population surveys, response to postal
   questionnaires may be improved by reducing their length and offering
   incentives. The aim of this study was to investigate whether
   questionnaire length and/or the offer of an incentive improves the
   response of GPs to a postal questionnaire survey.
   Methods: A postal questionnaire survey was sent to 800 UK GPs randomly
   selected from Binley's database; a database containing contact details
   of professionals working in UK general practices. The random sample of
   GPs was assigned to one of four groups of 200, each receiving a
   different questionnaire, either a standard (eight sides of A4) or an
   abbreviated (four sides of A4) questionnaire, with or without the offer
   of an incentive (a prize draw entry for a 100 pound voucher) for
   completion. The effects of questionnaire length and offer of incentive
   on response were calculated.
   Results: Of 800 mailed questionnaires, 19 GPs did not meet inclusion
   criteria and 172 (adjusted response 22.0\%) completed questionnaires
   were received. Among the four groups, response ranged from 20.1\%
   (standard questionnaire with no incentive and abbreviated questionnaire
   with incentive) through 21.8\% (standard questionnaire with incentive),
   to 26.0\% (abbreviated questionnaire with no incentive). There were no
   significant differences in response between the four groups (p = 0.447),
   between the groups receiving the standard versus the abbreviated
   questionnaire (\% difference -2.1\% (95\% confidence interval (CI) -7.9,
   3.7)) or the groups offered an incentive versus no incentive (\%
   difference -2.1\% (95\% CI -7.9, 3.7).
   Conclusions: Strategies known to improve response to postal
   questionnaire surveys in the general population do not significantly
   improve the response to postal questionnaire surveys among GPs. Further
   refinements to these strategies, or more novel strategies, aimed at
   increasing response specifically among GPs need to be identified in
   order to maximise data quality and generalisability of research results.}},

Title = {{Survey nonresponse among ethnic minorities in a national health survey -
   a mixed-method study of participation, barriers, and potentials}},
Journal = {{ETHNICITY \& HEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{611-632}},
Abstract = {{Objectives. The participation rate in the Danish National Health Survey
   (DNHS) 2010 was significantly lower among ethnic minorities than ethnic
   Danes. The purpose was to characterize nonresponse among ethnic
   minorities in DNHS, analyze variations in item nonresponse, and
   investigate barriers and incentives to participation.
   Design. This was a mixed-method study. Logistic regression was used to
   analyze nonresponse using data from DNHS (N = 177,639 and chi-square
   tests in item nonresponse analyses. We explored barriers and incentives
   regarding participation through focus groups and cognitive interviews.
   Informants included immigrants and their descendants of both sexes, with
   and without higher education.
   Results. The highest nonresponse rate was for non-Western descendants
   (80.0\%) and immigrants 25 (72.3\%) with basic education. Immigrants and
   descendants had higher odds ratios (OR = 3.07 and OR = 3.35,
   respectively) for nonresponse than ethnic Danes when adjusted for sex,
   age, marital status, and education. Non-Western immigrants had higher
   item nonresponse in several question categories. Barriers to
   non-participation related to the content, language, format, and layout
   of both the questionnaire and the cover letter. The sender and setting
   in which to receive the questionnaire also influenced answering
   incentives. We observed differences in barriers and incentives between
   immigrants and descendants.
   Conclusions. Nonresponse appears related to linguistic and/or
   educational limitations, to alienation generated by the questions' focus
   on disease and cultural assumptions, or mistrust regarding anonymity.
   Ethnic minorities seem particularly affected by such barriers. To
   increase survey participation, questions could be sensitized to reflect
   multicultural traditions, and the impact of sender and setting
   considered.}},

Title = {{Students' perspectives on e-portfolio development and implementation: A
   case study in Taiwanese higher education}},
Journal = {{AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{641-656}},
Abstract = {{This study explores students' perceptions related to the implementation
   of e-portfolios in the context of Taiwanese higher education. Thirty
   Taiwanese university students were interviewed, and data analysis
   includes 14 interviewees' e-portfolios and responses to 281 valid
   surveys from non-interviewed students. The study presents students'
   perspectives using textual descriptions and visual presentations related
   to developing e-portfolios. A three-stage model developed by the first
   author links five critical success factors for implementing e-portfolios
   in Taiwan. Overall, the students' perceived usefulness, university
   support, and e-portfolio audiences (i.e., educators, employers, and
   friends) as well as intentions to visit e-portfolios are the major
   components used to promote e-portfolios in Taiwanese higher education.
   The findings of the study indicate that the value of developing an
   e-portfolio can be enhanced by using incentives such as design contests
   or encouragement through various other activities (e.g., class
   activities, team projects, and extracurricular activities).
   Accessibility, interactivity, and ownership are university students'
   concerns when they are deciding to develop e-portfolios. For
   implementing a system of e-portfolios, the study suggests guidelines
   that can become important references for countries with similar cultural
   backgrounds in higher education. New insights relevant for scholars from
   Western countries also appear at the end.}},

Title = {{National survey of physicians to determine the effect of unconditional
   incentives on response rates of physician postal surveys}},
Journal = {{BMJ OPEN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: Physicians are a commonly targeted group in health research
   surveys, but their response rates are often relatively low. The goal of
   this paper was to evaluate the effect of unconditional incentives in the
   form of a coffee card on physician postal survey response rates.
   Design: Following 13 key informant interviews and eight cognitive
   interviews a survey questionnaire was developed.
   Participants: A random sample of 534 physicians, stratified by physician
   group (geriatricians, family physicians, emergency physicians) was
   selected from a national medical directory.
   Setting: Using computer generated random numbers; half of the physicians
   in each stratum were allocated to receive a coffee card to a popular
   national coffee chain together with the first survey mailout.
   Interventions: The intervention was a \$10 Tim Hortons gift card given
   to half of the physicians who were randomly allocated to receive the
   incentive.
   Results: 265 (57.0\%) physicians completed the survey. The response rate
   was significantly higher in the group allocated to receive the incentive
   (62.7\% vs 51.3\% in the control group; p=0.01).
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that an unconditional incentive in the
   form of a coffee gift card can substantially improve physician response
   rates. Future research can look at the effect of varying amounts of cash
   on the gift cards on response rates.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED CLINICAL INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{577-590}},
Abstract = {{Background: A core measure of the meaningful use of EHR incentive
   program is the generation and provision of the clinical summary of the
   office visit, or the after visit summary (AVS), to patients. However,
   little research has been conducted on physician perceptions and beliefs
   about the AVS.
   Objective: Evaluate physician perceptions and beliefs about the AVS and
   the effect of the AVS on workload, patient outcomes, and the care the
   physician delivers.
   Methods: A cross-sectional online survey of physicians at two academic
   medical centers (AMCs) in the northeast who are participating in the
   meaningful use EHR incentive program.
   Results: Of the 1 795 physicians at both AMCs participating in the
   incentive program, 853 completed the survey for a response rate of
   47.5\%. Eighty percent of the respondents reported that the AVS was easy
   (very easy or quite easy or somewhat easy) to generate and provide to
   patients. Nonetheless, more than three-fourths of the respondents
   reported a negative effect of generating and providing the AVS on
   workload of office staff (78\%) and workload of physicians (76\%).
   Primary care physicians had more positive beliefs about the effect of
   the AVS on patient outcomes than specialists (p< 0.001) and also had
   more positive beliefs about the effect of the AVS on the care they
   delivered than specialists (p< 0.001).
   Conclusions: Achieving the core meaningful use measure of generating and
   providing the AVS was easy for physicians but it did not necessarily
   translate into positive beliefs about the effect of the AVS on patient
   outcomes or the care the physician delivered. Physicians also had
   negative beliefs about the effect of the AVS on workload. To promote
   positive beliefs among physicians around the AVS, organizations should
   obtain physician input into the design and implementation of the AVS and
   develop strategies to mitigate its negative impacts on workload.}},

Title = {{Regulatory incentives as a moderator of determinants for the adoption of
   Malaysian food safety system}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1336-1353}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the contribution
   of regulatory incentives offered by regulators as a moderator variable
   enhancing adoption of Malaysian food safety system (MeSTI).
   Design/methodology/approach - Structural equation modelling (SEM) with
   partial least square (PLS) was used to examine the determinants of MeSTI
   adoption in food industry.
   Findings - Responses to a questionnaire were collected from 89 firms,
   and statistical results confirmed that organizational factors (top
   management support and perceived technical competent) and scheme factors
   (perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use) have significant
   influence upon MeSTI adoption. While environment factors (perceived
   industry pressure and perceived government pressure) and expected
   factors (expected social legitimacy and expected economic
   competitiveness) did not have significant impact on MeSTI adoption.
   Regulatory incentives the government offered had no moderating effect on
   the relationships of the determinants studied.
   Practical implications - Although many companies remain unfamiliar or
   have limited knowledge of MeSTI, the respondents surveyed herein, which
   were small and medium enterprises (SMEs), argued that MeSTI was very
   helpful in controlling food safety standards inMalaysia. Government or
   non- government regulatory agencies should promote and encourage food
   industry compliance with the Malaysian food safety certification.
   Governments also need to rethink and redesign current regulatory
   incentives offers to the food industry, which often have no direct
   impact on the companies' business.
   Originality/value - Though many factors potentially could influence the
   industry to adopt a food safety scheme, the moderating effect of
   regulatory incentives is an interesting area to study in relationship to
   its potential effects to adopt food safety standards and practices. In
   some extent, this serves as a yardstick for measuring the impact of
   voluntary compliance and points to future directions for what should
   occur in the future.}},

Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{68-76}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Perpetual conservation easements (CEs) are popular for restricting
   development and land use, but their fixed terms create challenges for
   adaptation to climate change. The increasing pace of environmental and
   social change demands adaptive conservation instruments. To examine the
   adaptive potential of CEs, we surveyed 269 CEs and interviewed 73
   conservation organization employees. Although only 2\% of CEs mentioned
   climate change, the majority of employees were concerned about climate
   change impacts. CEs share the fixed-boundary limits typical of protected
   areas with additional adaptation constraints due to permanent terms on
   private lands. CEs often have multiple, potentially conflicting purposes
   that protect against termination but complicate decisions about
   principled, conservation-oriented adaptation. Monitoring is critical for
   shaping adaptive responses, but only 35\% of CEs allowed organizations
   to conduct ecological monitoring. In addition, CEs provided few
   requirements or incentives for active stewardship of private lands. We
   found four primary options for changing land use restrictions, each with
   advantages and risks: CE amendment, management plan revisions, approval
   of changes through discretionary consent, and updating laws or policies
   codified in the CE. Conservation organizations, funders, and the
   Internal Revenue Service should promote processes for principled
   adaptation in CE terms, provide more active stewardship of CE lands, and
   consider alternatives to the CE tool.}},

Abstract = {{Given the increased role of bibliometric measures in research
   evaluation, it is striking that studies of actual changes in research
   practice are rare. Most studies and comments on `a metric culture' in
   academia focus on the ideological and political level, and there is a
   clear shortage of empirical studies that analyze how researchers handle
   demands for accountability in context. In adopting a mixed-methods
   approach involving both bibliometric data and answers form
   questionnaires, we provide an in-depth study of how researchers at the
   faculty of Arts at Uppsala University (Sweden) respond to the
   implementation of performance-based research evaluation systems.
   Publication patterns from 2006 to 2013 show that journal publications,
   especially English-language ones, are increasing, and the proportion of
   peer-reviewed publications has doubled. These changes are in line with
   the incentives of the evaluation systems under study. Answers to the
   survey confirm that scholars are conscious about this development, and
   several respondents articulate a disagreement between disciplinary norms
   and external demands. However, disciplinary background as well as career
   stage or academic age appears to have a significant influence on how
   individual researchers react to the instigation of evaluation systems.
   Finally, responses to national and local evaluation regimes are complex,
   localized, and dependent on many factors. In-depth contextualized
   studies of research practices are needed in order to understand how
   performance-based funding systems influence academic research on the
   ground.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{123-130}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The HITECH Act of 2009 enabled the Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid
   Services (CMS) to provide financial incentives to health care providers
   who demonstrate ``meaningful use{''} (MU) of their electronic health
   records (EHRs). Despite stakeholder involvement in the rule-making
   phase, formal input about the MU program from a cross section of
   providers has not been reported since incentive payments began.
   To examine the perspectives and experiences of a random sample of health
   care professionals eligible for financial incentives (eligible
   professionals or EPs) for demonstrating meaningful use of their EHRs. It
   was hypothesized that EPs actively participating in the MU program would
   generally view the purported benefits of MU more positively than EPs not
   yet participating in the incentive program.
   Survey data were collected by mail from a random sample of EPs in
   Washington State and Idaho. Two follow-up mailings were made to
   non-respondents.
   The sample included EPs who had registered for incentive payments or
   attested to MU (MU-Active) and EPs not yet participating in the
   incentive program (MU-Inactive).
   The survey assessed perceptions of general realities and influences of
   MU on health care; views on the influence of MU on clinics; and personal
   views about MU. EP opinions were assessed with close- and open-ended
   items.
   Close-ended responses indicated that MU-Active providers were generally
   more positive about the program than MU-Inactive providers. However, the
   majority of respondents in both groups felt that MU would not reduce
   care disparities or improve the accuracy of patient information. The
   additional workload on EPs and their staff was viewed as too great a
   burden on productivity relative to the level of reimbursement for
   achieving MU goals. The majority of open-ended responses in each group
   reinforced the general perception that the MU program diverted attention
   from treating patients by imposing greater reporting requirements.
   Survey results indicate the need by CMS to step up engagement with EPs
   in future planning for the MU program, while also providing support for
   achieving MU standards.}},

   Design: Cross-sectional survey and qualitative interviews.
   Setting: Scotland and North West England.
   Participants: Early years professionals: 497 survey respondents included
   156 doctors; 197 health visitors/maternity staff; 144 other health
   staff. Qualitative interviews or focus groups were conducted with 68
   pregnant/postnatal women/family members; 32 service providers; 22

   Methods: Early years professionals were surveyed via email about the
   acceptability of payments to local health services for reaching smoking
   cessation in pregnancy and breastfeeding targets. Agreement was measured
   on a 5-point scale using multivariable ordered logit models. A framework
   approach was used to analyse free-text survey responses and qualitative
   data.
   Results: Health professional net agreement for provider incentives for
   smoking cessation targets was 52.9\% (263/497); net disagreement was
   28.6\% (142/497). Health visitors/maternity staff were more likely than

   tensions around acceptability', `need for incentives', `goals',
   `collective or divisive action' and `monitoring and proof'. While
   provider incentives can focus action and resources, tensions around the
   impact on relationships raised concerns. Pressure, burden of proof,
   gaming, box-ticking bureaucracies and health inequalities were
   counterbalances to potential benefits.

Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Meaningful Use (MU) provides financial incentives for
   electronic health record (EHR) implementation. EHR implementation holds
   promise for improving healthcare delivery, but also requires substantial
   changes for providers and staff. Establishing readiness for these
   changes may be important for realizing potential EHR benefits. Our study
   assesses whether provider/staff perceptions about the appropriateness of
   MU and their departments' ability to support MU-related changes are
   associated with their reported readiness for MU-related changes.
   Methods: We surveyed providers and staff representing 47 ambulatory
   practices within an integrated delivery system. We assessed whether
   respondent's role and practice-setting type (primary versus specialty
   care) were associated with reported readiness for MU (i.e., willingness
   to change practice behavior and ability to document actions for MU) and
   hypothesized predictors of readiness (i.e., perceived appropriateness of
   MU and department support for MU). We then assessed associations between
   reported readiness and the hypothesized predictors of readiness.
   Results: In total, 400 providers/staff responded (response rate
   approximately 25\%). Individuals working in specialty settings were more
   likely to report that MU will divert attention from other patient-care
   priorities (12.6\% vs. 4.4\%, p = 0.019), as compared to those in
   primary-care settings. As compared to advanced-practice providers and
   nursing staff, physicians were less likely to have strong confidence in
   their department's ability to solve MU implementation problems (28.4\%
   vs. 47.1\% vs. 42.6\%, p = 0.023) and to report strong willingness to
   change their work practices for MU (57.9\% vs. 83.3\% vs. 82.0\%, p <
   0.001). Finally, provider/staff perceptions about whether MU aligns with
   departmental goals (OR = 3.99, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 2.13 to
   7.48); MU will divert attention from other patient-care priorities (OR =
   2.26, 95\% CI = 1.26 to 4.06); their department will support MU-related
   change efforts (OR = 3.99, 95\% CI = 2.13 to 7.48); and their department
   will be able to solve MU implementation problems (OR = 2.26, 95\% CI =
   1.26 to 4.06) were associated with their willingness to change practice
   behavior for MU.
   Conclusions: Organizational leaders should gauge provider/staff
   perceptions about appropriateness and management support of MU-related
   change, as these perceptions might be related to subsequent
   implementation.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundThe Shorter Stays in Emergency Departments health target was
   introduced in New Zealand in 2009. District Health Boards (DHBs) are
   expected to meet the target with no additional funding or incentives.
   The costs of implementing such targets have not previously been studied.
   MethodA survey of clinical/service managers in ED throughout New Zealand
   determined the type and cost of resources used for the target. Responses
   to the target were classified according to their impact in ED, the
   hospital and the community. Quantifiable resource changes were assigned
   a financial value and grouped into categories: structure
   (facilities/beds), staff and processes. Simple statistics were used to
   describe the data, and the correlation between expenditure and target
   performance was determined.
   ResultsThere was 100\% response to the survey. Most DHBs reported some
   expenditure specifically on the target, with estimated total expenditure
   of over NZ\$52m. The majority of expenditure occurred in ED (60.8\%) and
   hospital (38.7\%) with little spent in the community. New staff
   accounted for 76.5\% of expenditure. Per capita expenditure in the ED
   was associated with improved target performance (r = 0.48, P = 0.03),
   whereas expenditure in the hospital was not (r = 0.08, P = 0.75).
   ConclusionThe fact that estimated expenditure on the target was over
   \$50 million without additional funding suggests that DHBs were able to
   make savings through improved efficiencies and/or that funds were
   reallocated from other services. The majority of expenditure occurred in
   the ED. Most of the funds were spent on staff, and this was associated
   with improved target performance.}},

Abstract = {{Internationalization and technological developments have changed the
   work organization in developed and developing industrial economies.
   Information and communication technologies, such as computers and
   smartphones, are increasingly used, allowing more temporal and spatial
   flexibility of work. This may lead to an increase in supplemental work,
   i.e. constant availability or working in addition to contractually
   agreed work hours. This in turn extends work hours and leads to work
   hours in evenings and weekends, causing interferences of work hours with
   biological and social rhythms for sleep, recovery and social
   interaction. However, empirical findings on the effects of supplemental
   work and work hours on occupational health are rather scarce. Therefore,
   the aim of this study was to investigate the association between (1)
   work-related contacts outside of regular work hours and (2) working in
   the free time with self-reported work-related health impairments in the
   fourth and fifth European Working Conditions Surveys (EWCS 2005, EWCS
   2010). Out of these cross-sectional, large-scale surveys, data on n = 22
   836 and n = 34 399 employed workers were used for weighted logistic
   regression analyses. About half of the sample reported at least
   occasional supplemental work. The results showed an increased risk of
   reporting at least one health problem for employees who had been
   contacted by their employer (EWCS 2005), or worked in their free time to
   meet work demands (EWCS 2010) in the last 12 months, compared to those
   reporting no supplemental work or work-related contacts during free
   time. These results were controlled for demographic variables, physical
   and mental work load, worker autonomy, and several work hours
   characteristics (e.g. hours per week, unusual and variable hours). The
   risk of reporting health problems was increased by being contacted both
   sometimes (Odds Ratio {[}OR] 1.26, 95\% Confidence Interval {[}CI]
   1.14-1.39) and often (OR 1.13, 95\% CI 1.02-1.25), whereas the frequency
   of working in the free time showed a clear dose-response effect
   (sometimes: OR 1.14, 95\% CI 1.04-1.24; often: OR 1.60, 95\% CI
   1.47-1.75), both compared to the category ``never{''}. The findings,
   thus, indicate that even a small amount of supplemental work beyond
   contractually agreed work hours may increase the risk of work-related
   health impairments. Working in the free time was associated with a
   substantial risk increase and might be a better indicator for actual
   work load than being contacted by the employer outside of contractually
   agreed work hours. Thus, in order to minimize negative health effects,
   availability requirements for employees outside their regular work hours
   should be minimized. While these effects definitely need further study,
   especially regarding a quantification of actual supplemental work and
   its temporal location, addressing the company culture and using
   incentives and policies might be options to reduce the amount of
   supplemental work and maintain the risks of health impairments in the
   working population at a lower level.}},

Title = {{Factors Related to Employers' Intent to Hire, Retain and Accommodate
   Cancer Survivors: The Singapore Perspective}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Despite the growing importance of cancer and return-to-work
   issues in occupational rehabilitation literature in the last decade,
   academic discussion is largely limited to survivors' perspectives and
   some exploratory studies from the employer side. This paper applies two
   classic theoretical models-Theory of Planned Behavior and Social
   Cognitive Theory-and key measures from previous studies to identify
   explicit relationships that explain employer factors to hire and retain
   cancer survivors. Methods Data were collected from online surveys with
   senior management executives and senior human resource specialists from
   various organizations in Singapore, with a total of 145 responses. The
   72-item survey instrument included a series of independent variables:
   (1) Attitudes toward cancer and cancer survivors; (2) Employers'
   efficacy; (3) Perceived moral obligation; (4) Employers' experience; (5)
   Outcome expectations; (6) Employment situation; (7) Social norms; and
   (8) Incentives, and dependent variables: (a) Employers' intention to
   hire cancer survivors; and (b) Employers' intention to retain cancer
   survivors. Results Regression analyses showed that the top three factors
   related to employers' intention to retain cancer survivors are perceived
   moral obligations (beta = .39, p < .001), followed by attitudes toward
   cancer (beta = .25, p < .01), and employment situation (beta = .17, p <
   .05). Employers' efficacy was associated with intention to hire (beta =
   .22, p < .05), coupled with attitude toward cancer survivors (beta =
   .22, p < .01). The findings also indicated the important role of
   existing relationship between an employer and an employee when it comes
   to retaining cancer survivors and government incentives for hiring
   cancer survivors in the workforce. Conclusions The present study
   provided an avenue to implement the proposed model-a potential study
   framework for the management of cancer survivors at work. Findings
   revealed that different messages should be tailored to employers toward
   hiring and retention issues and provided useful guidelines for employer
   education materials.}},
